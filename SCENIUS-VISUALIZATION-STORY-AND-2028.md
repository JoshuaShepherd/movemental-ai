# Scenius Visualization: What Story We’re Telling (and 2028 at 100)

**Purpose:** Clarify the narrative of the network visualization on why-movemental-final, resolve the real-vs-persona tension, and define the story of the ecosystem at 100—including a retrospective “2028 as though it happened” with 100 users all year.

**Related:** `NETWORK-EFFECT-VISUALIZATION-STORY.md`, `_docs/site-docs/scenius-network-viz.md`, `credibility-how-it-works.md`, `credibility-how-it-works-video.md` (S10 — 100 in the system).

## 1. What story are we telling with the visualization?

The scroll-driven panel does three things:

1. **Growth** — One voice (Alan) → two (Alan + Brad) → many, up to ~100 nodes. The scroll *is* the story of the scenius expanding.
2. **Progressive disclosure** — Click a node → modal with who they are and how they’re connected.
3. **Invitation** — We’re not only showing “who’s in today”; we’re showing **what the ecosystem looks like at scale** and **what happens for each person who takes a seat**.

So the story is: **Credibility in the AI age comes from being part of a network of verified voices. This is that network—who’s in it today, who’s next, and what you get when you’re in it.**

---

## 2. The tension: real people vs not-yet-real

**Current state:** In the data we have “known” nodes (Alan, Brad, Michael Frost, Deb, Lance, etc.) all marked `inNetwork: true`, plus persona nodes (“Church planter 1”, “Researcher 2”, …) as “who’s next.” In reality, **only Alan and Brad are in the network today.** The rest are either real people not yet onboarded or placeholder personas.

That mix is confusing: we show real names and faces for people who aren’t actually in the product yet, then switch to role labels. It blurs “in the network today” vs “this is the kind of voice that joins next.”

**Decision we need:** Choose one clear framing and stick to it.

### Option A: Empty seats (recommended)

- **In the network today:** Only nodes that are actually live (today: Alan, Brad). Real headshots, real names, “In the network today” in the modal.
- **The rest of the 100:** Treated as **seats**—what the ecosystem looks like at 100 and what happens for the person who fills each seat. No fake names. Use **persona/role labels** (“Church planter,” “Researcher,” “Trainer,” “Theologian,” …) with one line: *“The kind of voice joining the scenius next—where [X] is amplified through the network.”*
- **Story:** “We’re inviting you to see the ecosystem at 100. Two seats are filled. The other seats are for the next leaders—and here’s what each seat means for the person in it.”

So we’re showing **empty seats** in the sense of “slots in the scenius,” and for each slot we’re showing **what the person who takes that seat gets**: amplification, discoverability, circulation, mutual elevation (see below). The visualization answers: *What does it mean to be one of 100?*

### Option B: Real-only growth

- Show only people who are actually in the network. Today: Alan → Brad (two nodes). No personas. The “growth to 100” is implied by copy or a separate “at 100” frame (e.g. “Imagine 100 like this”).
- **Pro:** No real/persona mix. **Con:** We lose the visual impact of the full graph and the “empty seat” invitation.

### Recommendation

**Option A.** Keep the full ~100-node graph, but make the in-vs-next line unambiguous: **only actually onboarded leaders get real names and “in the network today.”** Everyone else is a **persona node** (role + one-line story). The story is: *This is the scenius at 100. Two seats are filled. The rest are for leaders like you—and here’s what happens when you take a seat.*

---

## 3. What happens when you take a seat? (Amplification and the rest)

For each person who joins the network, we’re telling that they get:

- **Amplification** — Existing credibility becomes legible and connected. Your work is linked, cited, and surfaced next to trusted peers. “Cited by N network pieces” / “Connected to N leaders” (in the modal or card) makes this concrete.
- **Discoverability** — One coherent home; content structured and findable; you show up when your people search for the topics you teach.
- **Circulation** — Content moves: linked, taught, quoted inside the ecology. Not “go viral,” but “move through the right people.”
- **Mutual elevation** — Success for one lifts the network. Your presence and links make others more findable; theirs do the same for you.

So the visualization’s “so what” is: **each seat is a position in a credibility graph where amplification, discoverability, circulation, and mutual elevation all apply.** Copy above/below (and in the modal for persona nodes) should say that explicitly: “Your content doesn’t sit alone. It becomes discoverable through this network—linked, referenced, and amplified by trusted peers.”

## 4. The story as the movement grows (x, y, z)

- **At 2 (today):** Two verified voices. The graph exists; links between them start to create “who points to you.” The story: *This is the beginning. The scenius is real but small.*
- **At 10, 25, 50:** More nodes, more edges. Each new leader adds their platform and their links. Discoverability and cross-linking compound. The story: *The network is growing; each addition makes the whole more findable and more credible.*
- **At 100:** Bounded scale. A hundred coherent platforms. Cross-linking built in. “Who points to you” is answerable. Content circulates. Mutual elevation. People can still know each other and vouch. The story: *A real, visible, linkable credibility graph—enough for discoverability, vouching, and circulation; not infinite scale.*

So the narrative arc is: **from one anchor to a full ecology at 100, where every number is a stage in the same story: more voices, more links, more amplification for each.**

---

## 5. The story of the ecosystem at 100

We’re inviting the reader to **visualize the ecosystem at 100**. So we need a clear, shared picture of what “100” means.

**At 100:**

- **A real graph.** Nodes and edges, links and citations. A hundred movement leaders, each with one coherent platform (one home, author legible, content as nodes).
- **Cross-linking built in.** Participants link to each other; “who points to you” is visible and answerable. The graph is the credibility signal.
- **Content circulates.** Work is taught, linked, quoted inside the ecology. Content that matters can move—faithful reach, content that compounds.
- **Mutual elevation.** Success for one lifts the network. No one is an island; credibility is distributed through the network, not follower count.
- **Bounded scale.** At 100, people can still know each other and vouch. We’re not optimizing for infinite growth; we’re optimizing for a size where relational credibility holds. Curation over growth.

So the story of the ecosystem at 100 is: **a real, visible, linkable credibility graph—enough for discoverability, vouching, and circulation; not infinite scale.** (Aligned with `credibility-how-it-works-video.md` S10.)

## 6. 2028 as though it happened — 100 users all year

*Written as a retrospective: we’re in early 2029, looking back at a year in which the Movemental scenius had 100 leaders in the system for the full year.*

---

### 2028 in review: The year we hit 100 and stayed there

By the start of 2028 we had crossed the threshold: 100 movement leaders were in the system, each with a single owned platform—one home, author legible, content as nodes. We didn’t add more. We held at 100 all year. The goal wasn’t growth for its own sake; it was to see what a bounded credibility ecology actually does when it’s full.

**What we saw:**

- **The graph became the story.** “Who points to you” was no longer theoretical. You could open the network and see it: links, citations, who taught whose material, who invited whom. New leaders joining (replacing those who stepped back) didn’t dilute the graph; they added new edges. The scenius was visibly a scenius—a network of verified voices, not a list of names.
- **Discoverability compounded.** A hundred coherent platforms, cross-linked and themed, meant that searches for “missional church,” “APEST,” “church multiplication,” “spiritual formation,” and dozens of related phrases consistently surfaced content from inside the ecology. No single node dominated; the network as a whole became the go-to place for that slice of the web. Amplification for each leader meant that their existing credibility was legible and connected—so the right people could find them.
- **Content circulated.** Articles were linked in syllabi, in resource lists, in other leaders’ posts. Books were cited and tied back to author pages. Talks were repurposed and linked. Content didn’t go viral; it moved through the people who already trusted the movement. That’s what we meant by “content that moves.”
- **Mutual elevation was visible.** When one leader’s course or book did well, the links from and to others in the network meant that success lifted adjacent nodes. Conferences and invitations flowed along the graph. We didn’t have to say “success for one lifts the network”; it showed up in invitations, citations, and referrals.
- **Revenue and sustainability.** Many leaders had strong credibility but had seen little from owned digital content before. In 2028, a majority kept the bulk of revenue from courses and resources because they owned the platform and the audience. The ecology didn’t make everyone rich; it made owned content a real contributor to sustainability. Books still had their place—but no longer as the only way to be credible or to earn.

**What we didn’t do:**

- We didn’t scale past 100. We said we’d stop at a size where people could still know each other and vouch. We meant it. When someone left, we refilled the seat with care—curation over growth.
- We didn’t promise “go viral.” We promised faithful reach: the right people find you, trust you, and carry your work forward. In 2028 that’s what we measured: search traffic to the right queries, links from peers, invitations and citations, content taught and quoted inside the movement.

**So 2028 was the year the scenius became legible as an ecosystem.** Not a theory—a real graph, a hundred platforms, cross-linking, circulation, and mutual elevation. Credibility in the AI age didn’t come from going viral. It came from being part of a network of verified voices. In 2028, that network had a hundred seats—and we saw what happened when they were full.

## 7. Summary: Story decisions for the visualization

| Question | Direction |
|----------|-----------|
| What story are we telling? | Credibility through a network of verified voices; the viz shows the scenius growing and what each seat in that scenius means. |
| Real vs persona? | Only actually onboarded leaders = real names, headshots, “In the network today.” Everyone else = persona nodes (role + one-line story): “empty seats” showing who’s next and what they get. |
| What does a seat give you? | Amplification, discoverability, circulation, mutual elevation—spelled out in copy and, where we have data, in the modal (e.g. “Cited by N,” “Connected to N”). |
| Story as we grow to 100? | From one anchor to a full ecology; at each size, more voices and more links mean more amplification for each. At 100: bounded, visible, linkable credibility graph. |
| 2028 at 100? | Retrospective: 100 users all year; graph as the story; discoverability and circulation compound; mutual elevation visible; revenue/sustainability from owned content; we held the line at 100. |

---

**Next steps (for implementation):**

1. **Data:** Set `inNetwork: true` only for Alan and Brad (or whoever is actually live). Mark all other current “known” nodes as persona or remove them from the “in network today” set until they’re onboarded.
2. **Personas:** Keep persona nodes (tiers 5–12) as role-based (“Church planter,” “Researcher,” …) with the one-line “kind of voice joining next” story; no fake names.
3. **Copy:** Add or tighten one line above/below the viz: e.g. “Two seats are filled today. The rest are for the next leaders—and for each, the same thing: your work discoverable, linked, and amplified through the network.”
4. **Modal:** For persona nodes, use the existing persona story; for in-network nodes, add “In the network today” and, when available, “Cited by N” / “Connected to N.”

## 8. How to tell the story on scroll (narrative + interactions)

**Problem:** Right now the panel only shows the network growing and allows click-to-open-modal. No text explains what’s happening during scroll; there are no narrative beats or guided interactions.

**Goal:** The scroll *tells* the story: short narrative lines that appear at key moments, so the viewer knows what they’re looking at and what it means.

### What we need

1. **Narrative strip (on-scroll text)**  
   A single line (or two) of copy that updates as the user scrolls, tied to the same GSAP/ScrollTrigger timeline as the graph. Position: bottom of the viewport (or a consistent corner) so it doesn’t cover the graph. Text is driven by timeline position, not by tier index alone—so we can use “labels” or duration offsets to show the right beat at the right time.

2. **Story beats (copy for each moment)**  
   Map the narrative arc to scroll positions:

   | Moment | When | Copy (example) |
   |--------|------|----------------|
   | After intro fades | Start of scroll | One voice. |
   | After tier 1 (Alan + Brad) | First connection | Two. The graph begins—who points to you. |
   | After tier 3–4 | Early growth | Connected voices. Each addition makes the whole more findable. |
   | Mid tiers (e.g. 6–7) | Scenius growing | The scenius grows. |
   | When full network appears | Last tier | At 100: a real credibility graph. |
   | During the hold | End of reveal, graph static | Your content discoverable through the people who already trust you. Click a node to explore. |

3. **Implementation approach**  
   - Add a **narrative container** (e.g. bottom of the pinned panel) with one element per beat, all `opacity: 0` by default.
   - In the same GSAP timeline, at the right positions: fade out the previous beat, fade in the next. Use refs (or `querySelector` on a narrative container ref) so GSAP can target the beat elements. No React state needed—pure timeline-driven opacity.
   - Typography: same as intro (fontHeading / fontBody), readable on the dark background (e.g. bright-snow-100, sage-300 for secondary).

4. **Optional interactions (later)**  
   - **Scroll hint:** Brief “Scroll to explore” that fades after first scroll (or after first beat).
   - **Progress cue:** Subtle step indicator (e.g. “2 → 100”) or “Growing scenius” steps; only if it adds clarity.
   - **Node highlight on reveal:** Slight emphasis (e.g. short glow) on the *new* nodes when they appear, so the eye is drawn to “what just joined.”

5. **Accessibility**  
   - Narrative text should be in the DOM and visible to screen readers; avoid “aria-hidden” on the strip. If we animate opacity, ensure the *current* beat has a live region or is focusable so AT users get the same story.

### Summary: what to build

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Narrative strip | Fixed area (e.g. bottom) with 5–6 beat divs; opacity animated by timeline. |
| Beats | One line per beat; copy as in the table above (or refined). |
| Timeline hooks | After intro, after tier 1, after tier 4, after tier 7–8, at last tier, at hold. Fade out previous, fade in next. |
| No new interactions in v1 | Click-to-modal stays; optional scroll hint / progress / highlight in a follow-up. |
