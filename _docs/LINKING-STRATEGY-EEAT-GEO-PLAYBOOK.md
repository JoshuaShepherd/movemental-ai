## 1. How Linking Works With EEAT

### 1.1 What EEAT Is (Recap)

E-E-A-T is a quality framework used by Google and increasingly by other systems (including AI answer engines) to assess whether content and sources deserve to be surfaced. It stands for:

- **Experience** — First-hand, lived experience with the topic.
- **Expertise** — Demonstrable knowledge and depth in the subject.
- **Authoritativeness** — Recognition as a go-to source (citations, mentions, links from others).
- **Trustworthiness** — Transparency, accuracy, clear purpose, secure and reliable site.

Linking is not a separate “trick”; it is one of the primary mechanisms by which **authoritativeness** and **trustworthiness** become legible to systems. Links answer: *Who points here? Who does this source point to? Is this node part of a coherent, quality graph?*

### 1.2 Why Links Matter for EEAT

- **Inlinks (who points to you)** signal that other nodes—especially trusted, topical ones—vouch for your content. They are a proxy for “others have judged this worth referencing.” Quality and relevance of inlinks matter more than raw count.
- **Outlinks (who you point to)** signal that you participate in a responsible information ecosystem: you cite sources, you connect to peers and quality references. They also help crawlers and systems discover and contextualize your content.
- **Internal links** create a coherent topology within your own site: they distribute equity, clarify hierarchy, and make your best content reachable from multiple entry points. They reinforce “this is one authoritative home” with clear structure.
- **Cross-domain links within a bounded network** (e.g. scenius) create a visible graph of mutual vouching. When 100 movement leaders link to each other’s work, the graph becomes a credibility signal that algorithms and humans can read.

### 1.3 The Credibility Layer

From Movemental’s own framing (*credibility-how-it-works.md*): content that is **optimized and linked** is not “more true”—it is **more legible and more connected**. It becomes:

- **Discoverable** — Findable by people searching for the topic, not only for you by name.
- **Legible to systems** — Search and recommendation systems can see it, categorize it, and weigh it.
- **Connected** — Other nodes point to it; in graph terms it has inlinks and is part of a topology.
- **Weighted** — Quality and relevance of who links, and how, affect how the system treats it.

So for EEAT: **linking is the infrastructure that makes your authority and trustworthiness readable.** Without a deliberate linking plan (internal + external + network), strong experience and expertise can remain invisible.

## 2. Best Practices: The Links That Matter Most

### 2.1 Internal Linking (On a Single Platform)

| Practice | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Hub-and-spoke from key themes** | Pillar pages (e.g. “APEST,” “Missional Church”) link to articles, courses, and book chapters; those pieces link back to the pillar. Clarifies topical authority and intent. |
| **Contextual, anchor-rich links** | Use descriptive anchor text (not “click here”) so crawlers and users understand target content. Avoid over-optimization (exact-match stuffing). |
| **Links from high-authority pages** | Homepage, about, and main nav pages should link to your best content so equity and crawl priority flow to what you want to rank and surface. |
| **Breadcrumbs and structural links** | Consistent URL and breadcrumb structure plus “related content” blocks create a clear hierarchy and more internal paths. |
| **Sitemaps and crawlability** | All important content linked from at least one other page; no orphan pages. XML sitemap includes priority and frequency where appropriate. |

### 2.2 External Linking (Outbound)

| Practice | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Link to quality, topical sources** | Citing reputable sources (studies, peers, institutions) supports E-E-A-T: you’re part of a responsible information ecosystem. |
| **Link to peers and collaborators** | In a scenius, linking out to other movement leaders and their work is the “show the graph” behavior. It’s credibility infrastructure. |
| **Avoid link schemes and paid links for manipulation** | Paid or manipulative link schemes can trigger quality actions. Natural editorial links and genuine citations are the standard. |
| **Use `rel` attributes appropriately** | `rel="nofollow"` or `rel="sponsored"`/`rel="ugc"` where required (e.g. UGC, paid placements); do not nofollow every outlink or you undercut the signal of “we vouch for these sources.” |

### 2.3 Inbound Links (Earned / Network)

| Practice | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Relevant, topical referrers** | Links from sites and pages that share thematic relevance pass stronger authority and intent signals. |
| **Diverse anchor text** | Natural mix of brand, URL, and topical anchors; avoid single-keyword over-optimization. |
| **Scenius cross-linking** | Other Movemental leaders linking to your content creates a curated, high-trust inlink set—the “100 nodes” effect. |
| **Mentions and citations** | Being cited (with or without a link) still contributes to authoritativeness; actual links make the signal machine-readable. |

### 2.4 Cross-Platform Linking (Movemental Ecosystem)

| Practice | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Leader A ↔ Leader B** | Reciprocal or one-way links between leader platforms (e.g. alanhirsch.movemental.ai ↔ bradbrisco.movemental.ai) build the credibility graph. |
| **Central hub (movemental.ai) ↔ leader sites** | Movemental.ai links to each leader’s platform (library, about, featured content); leaders can link back to movemental.ai (Why Movemental, How It Works, Compare, Network). |
| **Stable, descriptive URLs** | Use clean, semantic paths (e.g. `/library`, `/courses/[slug]`, `/articles/[slug]`) so links remain valid and interpretable. |
| **Consistent attribution** | When content is quoted or referenced across platforms, link to the canonical URL on the owner’s site. |

## 3. Comprehensive List of Linking Ideas

Use this as an idea bank for internal planning, content briefs, and product features. Not every idea applies to every leader or phase; prioritize by impact and capacity.

### 3.1 Internal (Within One Leader’s Platform)

- Homepage → featured courses, books, articles, “Start here” or fit-check.
- About / bio → books, key articles, orgs, “Who I’m connected to” (with links to other leaders).
- Library index → filters by content type and portal/theme; each card links to detail page.
- Article detail → related articles, related course, book chapter, author bio; breadcrumb to theme/portal.
- Course landing → curriculum outline (deep links to lessons), related books/articles, instructor bio.
- Course lesson → “Related reading,” “Next/previous,” link back to course hub.
- Book detail → TOC (chapters), “Related courses,” “More from this author,” purchase/read CTA.
- Book chapter (read view) → cross-references to other chapters, related articles, course.
- Portal/theme hub → all content tagged to that portal (courses, articles, books); links to each.
- Footer → Library, Pricing, Contact, About; optional “Network” or “Other voices” linking to Movemental and/or peer leaders.
- Search results → each result links to canonical URL of the content.
- Author/profile page → all content by that author with clear links.

### 3.2 Cross-Platform (Leader ↔ Leader, Leader ↔ Movemental)

- “Network” or “Scenius” section on movemental.ai → list or graph of leaders with links to each leader’s platform (e.g. alanhirsch.movemental.ai).
- Leader site footer or “Network” block → “Explore other Movemental voices” with links to 3–5 peers or to movemental.ai/network.
- Co-authored or co-taught content → link to co-author’s profile and relevant content on their platform.
- “Recommended by” or “If you liked this, try” → suggest one other leader’s course or article with direct link.
- Compare / pricing page on movemental.ai → link to fit-check, how-it-works, and optionally to a leader’s platform as an example.
- Why Movemental / How It Works → link to fit-check, pricing, team, learn, book; optionally “Meet the leaders” → network or leader list.
- Blog or article on movemental.ai that references a leader → link to that leader’s platform or specific piece.
- Leader’s “About” or “Partners” → link to Movemental (Why, How it works) and to 2–3 peer leaders they collaborate with.

### 3.3 External (Outside Movemental)

- Citations in articles → link to source (study, book on publisher site, peer’s article).
- “Resources” or “Further reading” → links to institutions, conferences, publishers, trusted orgs.
- Speaker/event pages → link to event site, host org, co-speakers’ sites.
- Social and contact → link to official social profiles, contact page; keep these consistent and updated.
- Donations, partnerships → link to designated donation or partner pages with appropriate `rel` if required.

### 3.4 Content-to-Content (Semantic and Thematic)

- Article “See also” / “Related” → same theme or portal; same author; or “People who read this also read.”
- Course “Prerequisites” or “Complements” → link to another course (same or different leader) or to a book chapter.
- Book “Related courses” → link to courses that build on or complement the book.
- Thematic clusters → every article in a cluster links to the pillar and to 1–2 others in the cluster.
- Quote or excerpt from another leader → link to the full piece on their platform (canonical URL).

### 3.5 Technical and Structural

- XML sitemap → all public, indexable URLs; optional priority/frequency for key pages.
- HTML sitemap (optional) → human-readable list of main sections and key content with links.
- Breadcrumbs → every content page; each segment links to the corresponding level.
- Pagination and filters → `rel="next"`/`rel="prev"` where applicable; canonical for filtered views to avoid duplicate signals.
- Redirects → preserve link equity: 301 for permanent moves; avoid chaining.
- Internal links in RSS/feeds → ensure item links go to canonical article URL.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) → `WebPage`, `Article`, `Course`, `Book` with correct `url` and optional `mainEntityOfPage` so systems resolve canonical URLs.

### 3.6 Scenius-Specific (Credibility Graph)

- Scenius visualization (e.g. on Why Movemental) → each node clickable to leader profile or platform.
- “Voices joining” or “Leaders on the platform” → cards with link to each leader’s site.
- Network discovery page → search or browse leaders; each result links to leader platform.
- Cross-promotion in newsletter or launch → “This week: [Leader]’s new course” with link.
- “Who’s in the network” / directory → name, bio, link to platform; optional by theme or region.
- Onboarding “Network & Launch” phase → encourage new leader to add outbound links to 3–5 peers and to movemental.ai.

### 3.7 EEAT-Reinforcing Links

- About page → links to orgs, academic appointments, books (with publisher or retailer links), key talks or events.
- Byline and author box → link to full bio, other articles, social (if public).
- “Sources” or “References” at end of long-form piece → each source linked.
- Legal/trust → Terms, Privacy, Contact linked from footer and where relevant (e.g. sign-up).
- Clear “who we are” → team page, about Movemental, link to AI book or learn hub so systems see a real entity behind the content.

## 4. Movemental Linking Strategy Guide

This section is the **operational playbook**: how Movemental should conduct linking across the product, content, and community. It is technical where it needs to be and aligned with the credibility playbook (one home, author legibility, content as nodes, linking in and out, restraint).

### 4.1 Principles

1. **One home per leader.** Each leader’s platform is the single canonical node for their name, work, and affiliations. All linking strategy assumes this hub exists and should be reinforced (internal links) and connected (external and scenius links).
2. **Author legible (E-E-A-T).** Linking supports this by: outbound links to sources and peers (expertise, trust); inbound and cross-links from the network (authority); internal links that surface who the author is and what they’ve done (experience, expertise).
3. **Content as nodes.** Every major piece of content (article, course, book, portal) is a node: it has a stable URL, is linked from at least one other place, and where appropriate links to related nodes (internal and external).
4. **Build and show the graph.** The scenius is a credibility graph. Linking is the primary way to “show” it: leaders link to each other; movemental.ai surfaces the network; the visualization and directory make the graph visible to humans and crawlable by systems.
5. **Restraint.** No link schemes, no buying links, no over-optimized anchor text. Link when it’s genuinely useful and credibility-supporting.

### 4.2 Platform-Level Responsibilities (Uniform)

These are **uniform** across all leaders (see UNIFORM-AND-DISTINCT-PLATFORM-GUIDE.md); the platform provides the structure and defaults.

| Area | Responsibility | Implementation notes |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **URL structure** | Stable, semantic URLs for library, courses, books, articles, about. | Same pattern per leader: e.g. `/library`, `/courses/[slug]`, `/books/[slug]`, `/articles/[slug]`. |
| **Internal link patterns** | Templates include related content, breadcrumbs, byline links, portal/thematic links. | Design system and components: RelatedArticles, Breadcrumb, AuthorByline with link to profile. |
| **Footer** | Same slots: e.g. Library, Pricing, Contact, About; optional Network. | Footer component with configurable “Network” links (other leaders, movemental.ai). |
| **Sitemaps** | XML sitemap for each leader subdomain; include all indexable content. | Generated from CMS/DB; updated on publish. |
| **Canonical and alternates** | Canonical URL on every page; hreflang if multi-language. | Meta and link tags in layout; avoid duplicate-content confusion. |
| **Structured data** | Article, Course, Book, Organization, Person where applicable. | JSON-LD with correct `url`; supports rich results and AI parsing. |

### 4.3 Leader-Level Responsibilities (Distinct)

These are **distinct** per leader: content and configuration choices.

| Area | Responsibility | Implementation notes |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Outbound links in content** | Author/editor links to sources, peers, and relevant external pages. | No auto-linking; human choice. Optional: “Suggest links” from AI (human approves). |
| **Network links** | Leader chooses which peers to link to (footer, about, “Recommended”). | Config: list of peer URLs or pick from Movemental directory. |
| **External links (orgs, social)** | Per UNIFORM-AND-DISTINCT: “External links — Speaking, contact, social, donations.” | Profile/org fields; rendered in about, footer, or contact. |
| **Content density and internal links** | How many articles/courses and how heavily they cross-link. | Depends on content volume; playbook recommends at least 1–2 internal links per piece to related content. |

### 4.4 Movemental.ai (Central Hub) Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility | Implementation notes |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Nav and footer** | Links to fit-check, why-movemental, how-it-works, pricing, compare, team, learn, book, network. | Consistent across pages; no orphan key pages. |
| **Why Movemental / How It Works** | CTAs to fit-check, how-it-works, pricing; “Explore the platform” → example leader or /network. | Copy and CTA matrix as in site-docs. |
| **Network / scenius** | Directory or graph of leaders with links to each leader’s platform. | Each node/card: link to leader subdomain (e.g. alanhirsch.movemental.ai). |
| **Compare page** | Links to fit-check, pricing; optional deep-dive (e.g. Substack) with internal links. | As per compare-options-sources and compare-page-substack-design. |
| **Blog or editorial** | Any post that names a leader or their work → link to that leader’s platform or piece. | Editorial guideline: always link to canonical URL on leader site. |
| **Voices joining / linked writers** | Section on why-movemental-final: link each writer to their profile or content. | API and UI already surface linked writers; ensure each card links to their content. |

### 4.5 Onboarding and Ongoing Behavior

| Phase | Linking action |
|-------|----------------|
| **Discovery & Vision** | Set expectation: “Your platform will be one node in the Movemental graph; we’ll link to you and you’ll be encouraged to link to peers and to Movemental.” |
| **Content Research** | Identify existing external references (orgs, co-authors, sources) to preserve or add as outbound links. |
| **Platform Architecture** | Configure footer “Network” slots, about-page org/social links, and default related-content components. |
| **Network & Launch** | Provide checklist: (1) Add 3–5 outbound links to peer leaders or movemental.ai. (2) Ensure about/bio has links to your orgs and key work. (3) Confirm movemental.ai network/directory includes you with correct link. (4) Optional: one cross-promotion (e.g. newsletter, social) linking to another leader’s new content. |
| **After launch** | Ongoing: add internal links when publishing new content; add outbound links when citing or recommending; respond when peers link to you (e.g. thank, reciprocate where natural). |

### 4.6 Checklist: Per-Leader Credibility Amplification (Linking)

Use this at launch and at content milestones.

- [ ] **One home:** Platform is live with stable base URL; no duplicate “homes” (e.g. old site still linked as primary).
- [ ] **Internal links:** Homepage links to library, key courses/books, about. Each article has ≥1 contextual link to related content; each course links to related articles/books where relevant.
- [ ] **Author legible:** About/bio page exists and links to orgs, key works, and (if applicable) “Who I’m connected to” with links to Movemental and/or peers.
- [ ] **Outbound to scenius:** At least 2–3 links to other Movemental leaders or to movemental.ai (Why, How it works, Network).
- [ ] **Outbound to sources:** Key articles that make claims link to at least one quality source or peer where appropriate.
- [ ] **Inbound / graph:** Movemental.ai network or directory includes this leader with correct link; at least one other leader or central page links to this platform (coordinated at launch if needed).
- [ ] **Technical:** XML sitemap includes key pages; breadcrumbs and canonical URLs in place; no critical broken links.
- [ ] **Restraint:** No paid or manipulative link schemes; anchor text is natural and varied.

### 4.7 Checklist: Platform-Wide (Movemental)

- [ ] **Central hub:** movemental.ai has clear links to fit-check, why-movemental, how-it-works, pricing, compare, team, learn, book, network.
- [ ] **Network page:** Every listed leader has a working link to their platform (subdomain or custom domain).
- [ ] **Scenius visualization:** Each node in the graph links to the corresponding leader (or profile) where applicable.
- [ ] **Voices joining:** Each linked writer’s card links to their content or profile.
- [ ] **Redirects and canonicals:** No broken or duplicate canonical signals across movemental.ai and leader sites.
- [ ] **Structured data:** Organization and/or Person for Movemental and for leaders where it makes sense; URLs correct.

### 4.8 Metrics and Monitoring (Technical)

- **Crawl and indexation:** Ensure key URLs are in sitemaps and get crawled; fix crawl errors and redirect chains.
- **Internal link coverage:** Periodically check for orphan or low-inlink pages; add internal links to important content.
- **Broken links:** Run broken-link checks on high-traffic and key pages; fix or redirect.
- **Referrals:** Use analytics to see which domains send traffic; reinforce relationships with quality referrers and scenius peers.
- **Rich results and SERP:** Monitor whether Article/Course/Book markup appears correctly and URLs resolve; fix structured data errors.

## 5. Linking & GEO: Extension of SEO Linking

### 5.1 What GEO Is

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** refers to optimizing content and presence for **generative AI systems**—LLMs, AI-powered search (e.g. Google SGE, Perplexity, ChatGPT search), and answer engines that synthesize answers from many sources. These systems don’t rank “ten blue links” only; they ingest content, citations, and references to produce answers and recommendations. GEO is the practice of making your content and authority **legible and citable** in that environment.

Movemental’s own docs (e.g. reflected-understanding for Alan Hirsch, Brad Brisco) already frame the gap as “not optimized for **SEO + GEO**”—discoverability in both traditional search and AI-mediated discovery. So GEO is an explicit part of the strategy.

### 5.2 How Linking and GEO Connect

- **Citations and references.** LLMs often cite or “ground” answers in URLs. Content that is **linked to** by other quality pages is more likely to be in the training or retrieval set and to be surfaced as a citation. So the same inlink quality that helps SEO also helps GEO: being a node that trusted sources point to.
- **Structured, parseable content.** Clear headings, semantic HTML, and structured data (Article, Course, Book) help both crawlers and AI systems understand what the page is and who it’s by. Internal links that create a coherent site graph help systems map your topical authority.
- **Author and source clarity.** E-E-A-T and “author legible” matter for GEO too: systems that want to attribute answers to credible humans look for clear authorship, about pages, and affiliations. Links from your content to your own about/bio and to orgs/peers reinforce that you’re a real, attributable entity.
- **Graph position.** In a scenius, cross-linking between Movemental leaders creates a visible graph of “who is connected to whom.” Systems that use link or citation graphs to infer authority can read this: multiple verified, topical nodes pointing to each other.
- **Canonical and stable URLs.** AI systems that surface links need stable, correct URLs. Consistent canonicals and redirects ensure that when you’re cited, the link works and points to the right page.

So: **linking in the GEO context is not different in kind from SEO linking.** It’s the same graph—internal, external, and network—but the “reader” of that graph now includes generative engines that use it for retrieval, attribution, and citation. What you do for SEO (one home, content as nodes, build and show the graph, quality inlinks and outlinks) **directly supports GEO**.

### 5.3 GEO-Specific Considerations

| Consideration | Implication for linking and content |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Citation likelihood** | Pages that are linked from multiple quality sources and have clear, substantive content are more likely to be retrieved and cited. Maintain strong internal and scenius links to key pieces. |
| **Entity consistency** | Use consistent names, job titles, and org names across the site and in structured data. Links to about and org pages reinforce entity resolution for AI. |
| **Quote-worthy and summary-friendly content** | Clear definitions, key takeaways, and well-structured sections make it easier for AI to quote or summarize you accurately. Internal links from these “pillar” sections to deeper content help both users and systems. |
| **No cloaking or manipulation** | Don’t serve different content to bots vs users to “game” AI. Transparency and consistency support trust; systems are increasingly able to detect manipulation. |
| **Structured data** | JSON-LD for Article, Course, Book, Person, Organization helps AI parse who wrote what and what the page is. Ensure `url` and optional `mainEntityOfPage` are correct so citations point to the right URL. |

### 5.4 Practical GEO Add-Ons to the Linking Playbook

- **Same linking playbook.** All of §4 (Movemental linking strategy) applies. GEO doesn’t require a second set of link tactics; it rewards the same: one home, author legible, content as nodes, build and show the graph.
- **Emphasize key “source” pages.** Ensure the pages you most want to be cited (pillar articles, key course landing pages, book pages) have strong internal links from homepage and nav, and where possible inlinks from scenius peers.
- **Structured data audit.** Periodically verify that Article/Course/Book/Person/Organization markup is valid and includes correct URLs and author/source information.
- **Monitor AI surfaces.** Where possible, check how your content or brand appears in AI answers (e.g. search in Perplexity, ChatGPT; SGE if available). Use that to fix attribution, add missing links, or strengthen key nodes.
- **Voice and restraint.** Don’t try to “optimize for AI” by stuffing or distorting content. Credibility in the room and in the graph is the goal; GEO benefits from the same restraint as SEO.

### 5.5 Summary: Linking, SEO, and GEO Together

- **SEO:** Links (internal, external, inlinks) help search engines understand relevance, authority, and topology. EEAT is supported by a clear author, one home, content as nodes, and a deliberate linking plan.
- **GEO:** Generative engines use similar signals—which URLs are cited, which sites and authors are connected, and what content is structured and attributable. The same linking strategy (one home, author legible, content as nodes, build and show the graph) makes you legible and citable in AI-mediated discovery.
- **Movemental’s scenius** is a bounded, high-trust graph. Linking within that graph—and from the central hub to leaders and back—creates a credibility layer that works for both traditional search and for AI: “who points to you” and “who you point to” are visible to both.
