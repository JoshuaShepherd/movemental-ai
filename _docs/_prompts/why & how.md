WHY MOVEMENTAL — FINAL PAGE (Canonical Topics 1–13)
Page format

Scrollytelling page with 8–9 blocks.
Use panel-style sections where helpful (full-height “slides”), but default to normal scroll.
Animation only when it clarifies (Remotion embed, subtle GSAP pinning).

Global UI rules

One idea per section.

Text: short, declarative, nod-worthy.

Use progressive disclosure: “Open the reasoning” toggles for people who want depth.

Use one embedded video (Remotion) for “Credibility collapse + amplification.”

WHY-1 — Hero: the situation (sets tone, not product)

UI

Full-height hero panel

Background: muted, minimal

Center: Remotion video embed (or animated GIF placeholder initially)

Optional: “Watch 90 seconds” label

Copy
H1: The way we decide what to trust has changed.
Subhead: Movemental exists to protect credibility—and help it travel—when the internet can no longer tell the difference.

CTA (single): Start discernment (not “Apply”)

Canonical coverage

(2) Credibility collapse (teaser)

(5) Credibility + amplification (teaser)

WHY-2 — The Credibility Collapse (Problem before product) (Topic 2)

UI

Text + simple diagram

Diagram: “signals → feed → flattening” (SVG / Framer motion)

Copy
Header: Credibility is harder to see.
Body (3 lines max):
Clear signals of authorship and trust used to be easy to notice.
Now everything arrives in the same format, at the same speed, with the same confidence.
The result isn’t just misinformation—it’s indistinguishability.

Disclosure toggle: “What changed?” (expands 3–5 bullets)

WHY-3 — The felt symptom: content doesn’t move (Topic 4)

UI

Split layout: left copy, right “stuck content” visualization

Visualization option:

A “content card” that never leaves a small orbit

Versus a card that moves through a network

Keep it abstract (no platform logos)

Copy
Header: Most good work doesn’t travel.
Body:
If you’re a credible leader, the issue usually isn’t quality.
It’s circulation.
Your work can be deeply true—and still remain largely invisible to the people who would actually receive it.

WHY-4 — The category error: credibility ≠ amplification (Topic 5)

UI

Two-track diagram (Credibility vs Amplification)

Use Recharts or SVG:

Credibility line = slow, cumulative

Amplification curve = fast, exponential

Motion: subtle draw-on

Copy
Header: Amplification and credibility are different forces.
Body:
Amplification increases reach.
Credibility is earned over time.
When amplification outruns credibility, trust collapses.

One line: Movemental is built to put them back in the right order.

WHY-5 — The solution: scenius / credibility ecology (Topic 3 + Topic 11)

(This is where we explicitly name relational credibility once.)

UI

Network visualization (nodes + links)

Show “institutional trust” fading (single pillar icon) and “relational trust” growing (web of connections)

Avoid buzzwords; let visual do work

Copy
Header: Credibility now travels through relationships.
Body:
Institutional trust can’t carry the weight it once did.
What remains scalable is relational credibility: visible networks of people who vouch for what they know is real.
Movemental is designed as a credibility ecology—a scenius—not a content platform.

Micro-callout: The network is part of the product.

WHY-6 — What we built for Alan (incarnational proof) (Topic 1)

UI

“Digital museum” / case-study strip

Use progressive reveal:

“Before” (messy archives, scattered links)

“After” (coherent platform home)

“Living system” (pipeline outputs: articles/courses/translations)

Use real screenshots when possible; otherwise template placeholders

Caption each screenshot with one sentence

Copy
Header: We started by building for one credible voice.
Body:
Movemental began as a full digital platform built to steward a real body of work—books, talks, decades of formation—so it could be found, trusted, and carried forward without distortion.

Optional single line (truthful, not ego):
It began as a focused build and became a shared vision.

(No “I built this.” No founder arc here.)

WHY-7 — Why now (AI as condition, not hero) (Topic 6)

UI

Constraint-collapse graphic (Time, Cost, Complexity)

Bars compressing from “years/agency” → “weeks/small team”

Copy
Header: This wasn’t feasible until recently.
Body:
Not because AI can replace leaders—
but because it can remove digital friction that used to require agencies, budgets, and endless time.
AI belongs in the background, translating your work into discoverability and circulation.

WHY-8 — Boundaries: who it’s for + stop at 100 + downward scaling (Topics 7, 8, 12)

UI

Three “boundary cards” in a row, calm tone

Each card has:

header

2–3 lines

“Why” disclosure

Copy
Header: This is intentionally narrow.
Card 1: Who it’s for
For leaders with embodied credibility and real communities.
Not for influencers, growth hackers, or content factories.

Card 2: Why stop at 100
Because relational credibility has limits.
We’re building a coherent ecology, not a marketplace.

Card 3: Downward scaling
Movemental scales depth, not noise.
The goal is not more reach for everyone—it’s faithful reach for the right people.

WHY-9 — Soul protection: embodiment + telos + grief (restrained) (Topics 9, 10, 13)

UI

Quiet, text-forward closing section

No diagrams

Add a small “rule of life” motif (3-hour/week hint is okay but keep detailed time on How page)

Copy
Header: Movement still happens offline.
Body:
Formation can’t be automated.
Community can’t be simulated.
Movemental exists to reduce digital burden—so leaders can stay present to people.

Telos line (Topic 10):
Success is being heard by your people—not everyone.

One restrained lament line (Topic 13, minimal):
This wasn’t built from hype. It was built from the sense that something precious was being lost.

CTA (single): Start discernment

HOW MOVEMENTAL WORKS — FINAL PAGE (Canonical Topics 1–11)
Page format

Scrollytelling, but more procedural than Why.
This page must feel like: “I can picture myself doing this.”

Global UI rules

More diagrams, more structure

Use progressive disclosure heavily

Use example artifacts (screenshots, template mocks)

Avoid technical stack talk (Next.js, Supabase, routes) entirely here

HOW-1 — Hero: the promise (procedural clarity)

UI

Hero with a single diagram preview (collapsed)

Button: “See the full playbook”

Copy
H1: A clear path from your existing work to a living system.
Subhead: No hype. No black box. Just a repeatable process built around credible leadership.

HOW-2 — The Alan Hirsch Playbook (end-to-end pipeline) (Topic 1)

UI

The vertical flow diagram you and I already aligned on:
Existing Work → Evergreen → Courses → Translation/Circulation → Compounding

Each node expandable (accordion)

Each expanded state shows:

1–2 example artifacts (screenshots or placeholders)

2 bullets “what this produces”

1 bullet “what you decide”

Copy
Header: The playbook (shown, not dumped).
Body:
We begin with what already exists.
We clarify your lane.
We turn it into a coherent body of work that compounds over time.

HOW-3 — Name → Profile → Platform (real onboarding) (Topic 2)

UI

A “wizard preview” UI

Stepper with 4 steps:

Name + basic identity

Links / corpus sources

Lane + voice calibration

Platform draft generated

Copy
Header: Onboarding that meets you where you are.
Body:
You don’t start with a blank page.
You start with your work—then we build a coherent platform around it.

Micro-callout: Intelligent, not bureaucratic.

HOW-4 — The Content Pipeline (what you actually get) (Topic 3)

UI

Funnel diagram: Inputs → Discernment → Outputs

Inputs: sermons, talks, books, notes

Outputs: articles, courses, collections, translations

Include “publish points” as icons

Copy
Header: Your work becomes structured outputs.
Body:
Your existing material becomes a living archive—then becomes evergreen content, courses, and translated circulation.
Creation is not accelerated. Circulation is.

HOW-5 — Writing assistant + feedback loop (human-in-the-loop) (Topic 4)

UI

UI mock: side-by-side editor

left: “your source”

right: “draft”

bottom: “feedback loop” comments

Add a small “revision history” timeline

Copy
Header: Quality is preserved through feedback loops.
Body:
AI helps draft and structure from your material.
Humans shape voice, meaning, and theological integrity.
The system learns your constraints over time.

HOW-6 — Voice preservation in practice (show deltas) (Topic 5)

UI

“Voice delta” comparison:

Original paragraph

AI-assisted paragraph

Highlighted “unchanged phrases” + “tuned phrases”

Optional: “voice constraints” chips (tone, vocabulary, cadence)

Copy
Header: You don’t sound like a machine.
Body:
Voice is treated as a constraint, not a vibe.
We test, correct, and preserve your language until the work sounds like you.

HOW-7 — Templates + customization (speed without bespoke hell) (Topic 6)

UI

“Mobbin-style template gallery”

6–9 tiles

Each tile opens to a quick “layout anatomy”

Show what’s fixed vs customizable:

fixed: IA, SEO schema, page system

flexible: palette, type scale, hero, modules, highlights

Copy
Header: Fast builds without chaos.
Body:
Templates give speed and coherence.
Customization keeps leaders feeling distinct.
We avoid bespoke rebuilds by keeping structure stable and expression flexible.

HOW-8 — With you vs for you (expectation clarity) (Topic 7)

UI

Two-column contract

Left: “We do with you”

Right: “We do for you”

Tight lists

Copy
Header: This is not outsourcing.
With you: lane clarity, course design, editorial decisions, discernment checkpoints
For you: setup, structure, automation, formatting, translation support, circulation infrastructure

HOW-9 — Where human judgment is required (and why) (Topic 8)

UI

“Checkpoints” timeline with 4–5 gates:

voice calibration approval

evergreen priorities selection

course design decisions

disclosure / integrity choices

final publish approval

Copy
Header: Some decisions must remain human.
Body:
Because credibility is moral, not mechanical.
The system is designed to force discernment where it matters most.

HOW-10 — Timeline: first 30 / 60 / 90 (or 30-day launch + next 60) (Topic 9)

UI

Timeline with two phases:

Launch (30 days)

Stabilize + Build (next 60 days)

Make it feel realistic, not aspirational

Copy
Header: A realistic timeline.
Body:
Week-by-week launch to get a coherent platform live.
Then steady iteration to build evergreen content and courses without overload.

(If you want to keep 30/60/90 language, do it here. But I still recommend “30-day launch + next 60” because it’s clearer.)

HOW-11 — What changes after launch (scenius effects) (Topic 10)

UI

Network layer appears post-launch

Visual: “your node” + “peer nodes” + “relational links”

Show “circulation lift” conceptually (not fake metrics)

Copy
Header: Launch is the beginning.
Body:
After launch, your platform compounds.
Your work circulates through the ecology—through relationships, not algorithms alone.

HOW-12 — What we don’t build (on purpose) (Topic 11)

UI

Simple “Not building” list with rationale toggles
Examples:

We don’t chase viral content

We don’t automate pastoral presence

We don’t build attention traps

We don’t optimize for everyone

Copy
Header: Restraint is part of the design.
Body:
Movemental is built to protect leaders from digital drift, not accelerate it.

CTA: Start discernment (or “If you’re ready, begin discernment.”)
