# AI Presentation Guide: Individual Leader Sites

> **How to Frame AI on Individual Leader Platforms (e.g., alanhirsch.com)**

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2026  
**Purpose**: Specific guidance for presenting AI capabilities on individual leader sites

---

## Core Principle

**Individual leader sites are about the LEADER, not the network.**

AI presentation should emphasize personal voice, individual authority, and tools that serve the leader's specific calling—not network effects or platform infrastructure.

---

## Key Messaging Framework

### Primary Message

> "AI that understands YOUR voice, YOUR theology, and YOUR movement focus. Tools that amplify your authentic expertise so you can create more content, reach more people, and advance your calling—while maintaining complete ownership of your platform, audience, and revenue."

### Three Core Pillars

1. **Voice Preservation**
2. **Personal Amplification**
3. **Your Content, Your Community**

---

## Pillar 1: Voice Preservation

### What to Emphasize

**AI Trained on Your Specific Voice:**
- "AI trained on YOUR specific voice, theology, and movement focus"
- "Understands your unique perspective and maintains your authentic voice"
- "Preserves your theological depth and practical wisdom"

**Authentic Expertise, Not Generic Content:**
- "Amplifies your authentic expertise, not generic AI-generated content"
- "Maintains your voice while enabling efficiency"
- "Tools that enhance your creativity, not replace your insight"

**Theological Depth Preserved:**
- "AI understands your theological framework and maintains depth"
- "Preserves nuance and complexity in your thinking"
- "Respects your movemental DNA and principles"

### What NOT to Say

- ❌ "AI that writes for you" (implies replacement)
- ❌ "Automated content generation" (sounds generic)

### What TO Say

- ✅ "AI that understands your voice and amplifies your expertise"

## Pillar 3: Your Content, Your Community

### What to Emphasize

**Complete Ownership:**
- "Your platform, your audience, your revenue (90% retention)"
- "AI assists your content creation, but you own everything"
- "Complete control over your content and community"

**Tools That Serve Your Calling:**
- "Tools that serve your movemental calling, not platform extraction"
- "AI that amplifies your mission, not someone else's agenda"
- "Infrastructure that serves your movement, not the platform"

**Your Voice, Your Authority:**
- "You maintain complete control over your voice and message"
- "AI enhances your authority, doesn't replace it"
- "Tools that strengthen your credibility, not dilute it"

### What NOT to Say

- ❌ "Platform features" (sounds like you're renting)
- ❌ "Network benefits" (that's Movemental.ai's story)
