### [05_implementation-checklist.md](./05_implementation-checklist.md)
**Implementation Checklist: Front-End & Content Mockup**

Page-by-page, feature-by-feature checklist for completing front-end and content mockups:
- MVP-first approach with optimal completion order
- Content descriptions for each page/feature
- Mobbin reference suggestions (what to search for, what patterns to look for)
- Mockup deliverables checklist
- Content creation priorities
- Quality checklist for each component

**Use this** as your personal checklist when creating mockups and content for Movemental.ai.

## Quick Reference

### Individual Leader Sites (alanhirsch.com)
**Message:**
> "AI that understands YOUR voice, YOUR theology, and YOUR movement focus. Tools that amplify your authentic expertise so you can create more content, reach more people, and advance your calling—while maintaining complete ownership of your platform, audience, and revenue."

**Focus:** Personal voice, individual authority, tools that serve their calling

---

### Movemental.ai Platform
**Message:**
> "Movemental Intelligence: AI trained on movemental DNA across all domains. A scenius-enhanced network where transformational leaders amplify each other, discover adjacent ideas, and build collective authority. The destination for movemental thinking—where AI serves Kingdom advancement, not extraction."

**Focus:** Network, scenius, collective intelligence, destination for transformation

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Movemental DNA, Not Generic AI
- AI trained specifically on movemental theology and practice
- Understands frameworks (APEST, mDNA, incarnational theology)
- Maintains theological depth and practical wisdom

### 2. Amplification, Not Replacement
- AI enhances human creativity and voice
- Preserves authentic expertise and theological depth
- Serves movemental calling, not platform extraction

### 3. Network Intelligence, Not Isolated Tools
- Scenius-enhanced through collective knowledge
- Cross-pollination and discovery capabilities
- Individual success strengthens the network

### 4. Credibility Through Quality, Not Volume
- Quality guaranteed by curation, not algorithms
- Real expertise distinguished from synthetic fluency
- Movemental DNA ensures substantive depth
