# AI Book: Trajectory, Development, and Latest Outline

**Purpose:** Trace the overall trajectory of the book about AI, summarize the current structural vision, and document the gap between that structure and existing content (including legacy “junk”).  
**Audience:** Author, editors, future agents.  
**Status:** As of the latest outline and README—structure is the target; content must be written or migrated to fit it.

### Author’s actual target: three sections

The author’s **current vision** is a **three-section** book, not seven parts:

1. **Section 1: Where we are now (re: AI)** — Kairos. What’s going on that matters: threat landscape (early-LLM threats as reference), credibility, we don’t know what’s real, audience shift, speed of adoption.
2. **Section 2: What we do about it** — The response: reframe, framework, boundaries, practice, long arc.
3. **Section 3: My 2025 as case study / where I am now** — Concrete starting point; beginner’s mind; how actual people use actual AIs; don’t underestimate AI.

The 21-chapter outline can be **grouped under** these three sections so no content is lost; the reader-facing structure is three parts. Full thread, mapping, and scaffold: **[THREE_SECTION_STRUCTURE_AND_SCAFFOLD.md](./THREE_SECTION_STRUCTURE_AND_SCAFFOLD.md)**.

## 1. Trajectory and Development (As Understood)

### Origins and Intent

The book is a **formation-oriented guide** for movement leaders who create or steward content and who are wrestling with AI. It is not a how-to manual, a manifesto, or a platform pitch. It aims to:

- **Diagnose** the credibility crisis (flood of AI content, broken signals, trust collapse).
- **Reframe** AI as an anthropological and adaptive-leadership problem, not a technological one.
- **Offer a framework** (amplification not replacement, voice preservation, scenius, transparency, boundaries) so readers can **discern** rather than follow a recipe.
- **Give permission** to slow down, refuse some uses, and use AI thoughtfully where it amplifies.

Success is measured by **reader formation**: posture shifts, clarity, discernment enabled, and decisions slowed (not rushed).

### How the Book Was Developed

1. **Early material** lives in `book-draft/`: chapter drafts with themes like credibility collapse, amplification, agents, 70/30 rule, spectrum and domains, what churches must refuse, embodied leadership. These were building blocks, not the final sequence.

2. **Synthesis and ordering** produced `manuscript-ordered/`: a set of 22 files (preface + 21 chapters) aligned to a **revised outline** that reordered, merged, and cut material. Editorial decisions (see BOOK_OUTLINE.md) folded SEO into “where we are,” merged “slowing down” with “green/yellow/red” into one chapter, merged threats with embodied leadership, merged agents/70/30/spectrum into “practice parameters,” and added a closing chapter “Where I am now.”

3. **manuscript-final/** is **legacy**: it reflects an **older** structure. It has different chapter numbers and titles (e.g. standalone “Why movement leaders were right to ignore SEO,” “Theological integrity,” “What churches must refuse,” “What they are ethically free to do,” “Why embodied leadership cannot be automated,” plus separate chapters for agents, 70/30, spectrum, personalization). That structure was **superseded** by the revised outline. So manuscript-final is the “junk” in the sense of **wrong structure**: useful raw prose in places, but not the target shape.

4. **Current state (per README):** The book is under **major revision**. Text in manuscript-final, manuscript-ordered, and related folders is “only slightly better than placeholder text.” The **canonical structure** is the revised outline (21 chapters + preface in 7 parts). Content still needs to be written or heavily revised to fit that structure and to meet the voice/style bar in BOOK_VOICE_AND_STYLE_GUIDE.md.

### Process and Voice

- **Human-in-the-loop narrative synthesis** (`process/human-in-the-loop-narrative-synthesis-method.md`) defines how author voice is preserved, how structure is proposed without finalizing content, and how bracketed notes and placeholders are used.
- **BOOK_VOICE_AND_STYLE_GUIDE.md** defines the target voice (prophetic/pastoral, guide and fellow traveler, calm and non-sensational) and how to avoid AI slop and tell-tale AI style. Manuscripts are measured against this in revision.

## 2. Latest Outline (Canonical Structure)

The **single source of truth** for the book’s structure is `manuscript-final/BOOK_OUTLINE.md` (and the matching copy in manuscript-ordered). What follows is a concise restatement of that outline.

### Part I: The Crisis and the Reframe

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 1 | **The credibility crisis** | Flood of AI content; broken credibility signals; trust collapse; AI as both problem and solution; why ignoring AI isn’t an option and uncritical adoption is dangerous. |
| 2 | **AI is not a technological challenge** | We interact via language; no tech expertise required; reframe: anthropological problem → adaptive leadership task (Heifetz-style). |
| 3 | **Where we are and why now** | Audience in different places; why this moment is different (discoverability + network verification); “why movement leaders were right to ignore SEO” as one beat here. |

### Part II: Who Is Speaking

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| — | **Preface: The story** | Where you started; tool → machine → system → platform → multi-tenant vision; crisis (e.g. October); turning point; still learning; invitation to the reader. |
| 4 | **Finding a guide** | Why a guide (not a guru); your role: on the trail, still learning, not selling certainty. |

### Part III: The Framework

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 5 | **AI as credibility amplifier, not credibility faker** | Use AI to amplify what’s real, not simulate what isn’t. |
| 6 | **Amplification not replacement** | AI amplifies (enhance, preserve, multiply); human voice remains primary. |
| 7 | **The maturity model and why experimentation matters** | Five levels (Awareness → Experimentation → Adoption → Integration → Leadership); four paths (placeholder names); experimentation/play as prerequisite to discernment. |
| 8 | **Voice preservation as priority** | Voice over efficiency; how AI can preserve or destroy voice. |
| 9 | **Scenius as the credibility solution** | Collaborative genius, network verification; connection to adaptive leadership. |
| 10 | **Transparency, disclosure, and trust** | Transparency as foundational; disclosure frameworks. |
| 11 | **My 2025 with AI** | Framework in practice: year in review; **centerpiece:** Movemental + Alan Hirsch project; what it illustrates (amplification, voice, transparency, human-in-the-loop). |

### Part IV: Pace and Discernment

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 12 | **Pace and discernment** | Slowing down vs urgency; AI as a means of slowing down; green/yellow/red lights for when to abstain vs accelerate. |
| 13 | **What to refuse and what we’re free to do** | Refusals (e.g. full automation, voice replacement, deceptive practices, formation without human presence); theological integrity as non-negotiable; what we’re free/obligated to do. |

### Part V: What We Protect

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 14 | **What AI displaces and what we protect** | Relationship, prayer, embodiment, formation; why embodied leadership cannot be automated. |
| 15 | **Practice parameters** | Agents (assistants, archivists, translators); 70/30 rule; spectrum and domains; context and personalization. |

### Part VI: Practice

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 16 | **AI and content creation** | Spectrum of use; transparency and voice in practice. |
| 17 | **AI and formation and leadership** | When AI serves or undermines formation and leadership; integration with scenius and embodied leadership. |
| 18 | **Everything I know about “prompting”** | Anti-prompt-engineering: clarity, specificity, iteration, humane communication; no jargon. |

### Part VII: The Long Arc

| # | Chapter | Role |
|---|--------|------|
| 19 | **From Gutenberg to networks of trust** | Historical arc; static publishing vs networked credibility. |
| 20 | **Content that moves** | Transformation not just engagement; how AI can serve or undermine movemental content; closing vision. |
| 21 | **Where I am now** | Author’s voice again; story continues; still learning; invitation: slow down, discern, we’re in this together. |

**Total: Preface + 21 chapters in 7 parts.**

## 4. Current Content vs Structure

| Location | Status | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **BOOK_OUTLINE.md** | Canonical | Target order and rationale for all chapters. |
| **manuscript-ordered/** | New structure, mixed content | Files match the 21-chapter + preface outline. Some chapters are placeholders (e.g. Ch 11 My 2025 with AI) or light drafts; prose should be revised for voice and completeness. |
| **manuscript-final/** | Legacy structure | Old chapter list and numbering. Contains prose that can be **mined** for content but must be **reassigned** to the new chapter titles and merged/split per the outline. Do not treat as the target shape. |
| **book-draft/** | Early drafts | Raw material; themes feed into the outline but do not define the final sequence. |
| **BOOK_VOICE_AND_STYLE_GUIDE.md**, **BOOK_META_OVERVIEW.md** | Stable | Apply when writing or revising any chapter. |

---

## 5. Summary

- **Trajectory:** Early drafts → synthesis and editorial reorder/merge/cut → revised outline (21 chapters + preface in 7 parts) as the canonical structure. Voice and meta-overview are defined; process is human-in-the-loop with placeholders and bracketed notes.
- **Latest outline:** As in Section 2 and in `BOOK_OUTLINE.md`: crisis and reframe → who is speaking → framework (including My 2025 with AI) → pace and discernment → what we protect → practice → long arc (Gutenberg to “where I am now”).
- **Gap:** Content must be written or migrated into the **manuscript-ordered** structure, brought up to the voice/style bar, and stripped of AI slop. **manuscript-final** is legacy (wrong structure); use it as a prose quarry, not as the book’s shape.
