# Chapter 10: The 70/30 Rule: AI Efficiency with Human Refinement

I want to start this chapter by acknowledging something that might feel practical: most of us want to be more efficient. We want to create more content, reach more people, multiply our impact. But we also want to maintain our authenticity, preserve our voice, keep our credibility.

And I think there's often a tension between those two desires. Efficiency can feel like it requires sacrificing authenticity. Authenticity can feel like it requires sacrificing efficiency.

But here's what I want you to understand: that tension doesn't have to be a trade-off. There's a way to be efficient while maintaining authenticity. There's a way to amplify your impact while preserving your voice. There's a way to create more content while keeping it real.

The framework for that is what I call the "70/30 rule." And I want to help you understand what it means, how it works, and why it matters.

## What the 70/30 Rule Means

Let me be clear about what I mean by the 70/30 rule. It's not a rigid formula. It's a principle. And the principle is this:

**70% AI draft, 30% your refinement.** AI handles the logistics—structure, formatting, variation, expansion. You provide the insight, the voice, the credibility, the soul.

I know this might sound like a formula. But it's not meant to be rigid. It's meant to be a guide—a way of thinking about the balance between AI efficiency and human refinement.

The key insight is this: AI is really good at some things (structure, logistics, variation). You're really good at other things (insight, voice, credibility, soul). And the 70/30 rule is about letting each do what they do well.

## What AI Does Well

Let me be specific about what AI does well. Because I think understanding this helps you use AI effectively.

**AI is good at:**
- **Structure:** Organizing ideas, creating outlines, structuring arguments
- **Expansion:** Developing points, adding detail, filling in gaps
- **Variation:** Creating different versions, adapting for different contexts, repurposing content
- **Formatting:** Making things look good, ensuring consistency, polishing presentation
- **Logistics:** Handling the mechanics of writing, the details of formatting, the work of organization

These are things that AI is genuinely good at. And when you let AI handle these things, you free yourself up to focus on what only you can do.

## What You Provide

But here's the other side: there are things that only you can provide. And I think understanding this is just as important.

**You provide:**
- **Unique insight:** Your perspective, your experience, your way of seeing the world
- **Personal story:** Your journey, your struggles, your formation
- **Earned credibility:** Your expertise, your track record, your reputation
- **Theological depth:** Your understanding of Scripture, your theological framework, your spiritual formation
- **Voice and soul:** What makes you you, what makes your work distinctive, what makes it valuable

These are things that AI can't provide. They come from you—from your experience, your formation, your humanity. And they're what make your work valuable.

## The Balance

Here's what the 70/30 rule is really about: finding the balance. Letting AI do what it does well (70%), so you can focus on what only you can do (30%).

This isn't about minimizing your contribution. It's about maximizing it. When AI handles the logistics, you have more time and energy for the things that matter—the insight, the voice, the credibility, the soul.

I know this might sound like you're doing less. But here's what I want you to understand: you're not doing less. You're doing more of what matters. You're focusing on what only you can do, while AI handles what it can do.

## Maintaining Authenticity While Gaining Efficiency

I know there's a concern here: can you really be efficient while maintaining authenticity? Can you really create more content while keeping it real?

And I want to be honest with you: yes, but it requires intention. It requires boundaries. It requires understanding what AI does and what you do.

**Here's how it works:**
- AI handles the logistics (structure, formatting, variation)
- You provide the insight, voice, credibility, soul
- You maintain oversight and control
- You refine and personalize what AI creates

When you maintain that balance, you can be efficient while maintaining authenticity. You can create more content while keeping it real.

But when you lose that balance—when you let AI do too much, when you don't maintain oversight, when you don't refine and personalize—you lose authenticity. You become efficient, but you're not real anymore.

So the balance matters. The 70/30 rule is about maintaining that balance.

## The Sustainable Content Creation Model

Let me give you a practical example of what this looks like. I call it the "sustainable content creation model," and it's based on the 70/30 rule.

**The model:**
- You spend 5 hours per week on content creation
- AI handles the logistics (structure, formatting, variation)
- You provide the insight, voice, credibility, soul
- You maintain oversight and control
- You create sustainable, authentic content

This isn't about creating as much content as possible. It's about creating sustainable, authentic content that serves your calling and your audience.

And the 70/30 rule makes this possible. When AI handles the logistics, you can create more content in less time, while maintaining authenticity and quality.

## Examples: What the 70/30 Rule Looks Like

Let me give you some concrete examples of what the 70/30 rule looks like in practice.

**Example 1: Sermon to Article**

**The process:**
- You preach a sermon on Sunday (your insight, voice, credibility)
- AI helps you structure it as an article, adapt it for written format, create variations (AI logistics)
- You refine it, personalize it, ensure it sounds like you (your refinement)
- Result: A sermon becomes an article in 90 minutes, while maintaining your voice and insight

**Example 2: Framework Development**

**The process:**
- You have a framework you've developed (your insight, experience, credibility)
- AI helps you structure it, expand it, create variations for different contexts (AI logistics)
- You refine it, ensure theological accuracy, maintain your voice (your refinement)
- Result: A framework is developed and adapted efficiently, while maintaining depth and authenticity

**Example 3: Content Series**

**The process:**
- You have a series of ideas you want to develop (your insight, voice, credibility)
- AI helps you structure the series, create outlines, develop individual pieces (AI logistics)
- You refine each piece, personalize it, ensure it sounds like you (your refinement)
- Result: A content series is created efficiently, while maintaining consistency and authenticity

Do you see the pattern? AI handles the logistics. You provide the insight, voice, credibility, soul. You refine and personalize. And the result is efficient, authentic content.

## Why This Matters for Movement Leaders

I want to pause here and speak directly to why this matters for you, as a movement leader.

Movement leaders have valuable insights, frameworks, and wisdom to share. But you also have limited time. You have other responsibilities. You can't spend all your time creating content.

The 70/30 rule makes it possible to create more content in less time, while maintaining authenticity and quality. It lets you amplify your impact without sacrificing your voice, your credibility, or your calling.

And that's valuable. Because movement leaders have something important to say. And the 70/30 rule helps you say it more effectively, more consistently, more sustainably.

## The Boundaries of the 70/30 Rule

I want to be clear about the boundaries of the 70/30 rule. Because I think there's sometimes a temptation to think it means you only do 30% of the work.

But that's not what it means. The 70/30 rule is about division of labor, not about effort. AI handles logistics (70%). You provide insight, voice, credibility, soul (30%). But your 30% is the most important part. It's what makes the content valuable.

So the 70/30 rule isn't about doing less work. It's about doing the right work. It's about focusing on what only you can do, while AI handles what it can do.

## A Word of Encouragement

I know this chapter has been about efficiency and balance and sustainable content creation. And that might feel like a lot to manage.

But here's what I want you to know: the 70/30 rule is simpler than it sounds. It's just about letting AI do what it does well, so you can focus on what only you can do.

You don't need to get the percentages exactly right. You don't need to follow a rigid formula. You just need to understand the principle: AI handles logistics. You provide insight, voice, credibility, soul. You refine and personalize.

And when you maintain that balance, you can be efficient while maintaining authenticity. You can create more content while keeping it real. You can amplify your impact without sacrificing your voice.

So don't overthink it. Just understand the principle. Just maintain the balance. Just focus on what only you can do, while AI handles what it can do.

## What's Next

In the next chapter, we're going to explore something that's particularly important for movement leaders: personalization and context as required for agentic value. Because when you're doing formation-oriented work, generic AI tools aren't enough. You need specialized agents that understand your context, your theology, your framework.

For now, though, I want you to sit with what we've covered. What the 70/30 rule means. How it works. Why it matters. How to maintain the balance.

These aren't abstract concepts. They're affecting you right now. They're shaping how you use AI, how you create content, how you build credibility. And understanding that reality is the first step toward responding to it well.

So take a breath. Process what we've talked about. And when you're ready, we'll move forward together.
