# Chapter 12: Domains of AI Usage

I want to start this chapter by acknowledging something that might feel obvious, but I think it's worth saying clearly: AI isn't one thing. It's used in different domains, for different purposes, with different implications.

And I think understanding those domains matters. Because using AI for technical tasks is different from using AI for theological content. Using AI for research is different from using AI for creative work. Using AI for formatting is different from using AI for formation.

So let's talk about the domains. What they are, how AI functions in each, what the implications are, and how to navigate them well.

## The Technical Domain

Let me start with the most straightforward domain: the technical domain. This is where AI handles tasks that are primarily mechanical or logistical.

**What this includes:**
- Formatting and structure
- Grammar and style checking
- Organization and categorization
- Technical optimization (SEO, metadata, etc.)
- Data processing and analysis

**How AI functions:**
- AI handles mechanical tasks that don't require human insight
- Human provides content, AI handles technical execution
- AI serves as a tool for efficiency, not replacement

**Implications:**
- Low risk to voice and credibility
- High efficiency gain
- Minimal transparency needs (can be assumed)
- Appropriate for most content

**Boundaries:**
- AI handles mechanics, not meaning
- Human maintains control over content
- AI serves efficiency, not replacement

This domain is relatively straightforward. AI handles technical tasks. Human handles content. The boundaries are clear. The implications are minimal.

## The Research Domain

Here's a domain that's a bit more complex: the research domain. This is where AI helps with information gathering, fact-checking, and source finding.

**What this includes:**
- Finding relevant sources and references
- Checking facts and claims
- Gathering information on topics
- Cross-referencing and verification
- Organizing research materials

**How AI functions:**
- AI helps gather and organize information
- Human evaluates, synthesizes, and applies
- AI serves as research assistant, not researcher

**Implications:**
- Moderate risk if over-relied upon
- High efficiency gain
- Transparency needed about research assistance
- Appropriate with human evaluation

**Boundaries:**
- AI gathers information, human evaluates it
- Human maintains responsibility for accuracy
- AI serves research, not replacement of research skills

This domain requires more care. AI can help with research, but human evaluation is essential. The information AI provides needs to be checked, evaluated, and applied by humans.

## The Theological Domain

Here's a domain that's particularly important for movement leaders: the theological domain. This is where AI helps with theological content, biblical references, and theological frameworks.

**What this includes:**
- Finding relevant biblical passages
- Checking theological accuracy
- Organizing theological frameworks
- Adapting theological content for different audiences
- Maintaining theological consistency

**How AI functions:**
- AI helps with theological tasks, but human maintains theological judgment
- Human provides theological framework, AI helps maintain consistency
- AI serves theological assistance, not theological thinking

**Implications:**
- High risk if not carefully managed
- Requires specialized agents trained on movemental theology
- Essential human oversight and verification
- Transparency critical for credibility

**Boundaries:**
- AI assists with theological tasks, human maintains theological authority
- Human maintains responsibility for theological accuracy
- AI serves theological assistance, not replacement of theological thinking

This domain requires the most care. Theological content is sacred. It requires accuracy, depth, and biblical grounding. AI can help, but human oversight is essential. And specialized agents trained on movemental theology are crucial.

## The Creative Domain

Here's a domain that might be less obvious: the creative domain. This is where AI helps with creative expression, storytelling, and communication.

**What this includes:**
- Helping with creative expression
- Assisting with storytelling
- Supporting communication and presentation
- Aiding in creative adaptation
- Helping with creative variation

**How AI functions:**
- AI helps with creative tasks, but human maintains creative vision
- Human provides creative direction, AI helps execute
- AI serves creative assistance, not replacement of creativity

**Implications:**
- Moderate to high risk to voice and distinctiveness
- Requires careful boundaries to preserve creativity
- Transparency needed about creative assistance
- Appropriate with human creative direction

**Boundaries:**
- AI assists with creative execution, human maintains creative vision
- Human maintains responsibility for creative expression
- AI serves creative assistance, not replacement of creativity

This domain requires care. Creativity is about distinctiveness, voice, and expression. AI can help, but it can also homogenize. So boundaries are essential.

## The Formation Domain

Here's a domain that's particularly sensitive: the formation domain. This is where AI might be used in discipleship, spiritual formation, or pastoral care contexts.

**What this includes:**
- Discipleship resources
- Spiritual formation materials
- Pastoral care content
- Formation curriculum
- Discipleship tools

**How AI functions:**
- AI might assist with formation resources, but human presence is essential
- Human maintains responsibility for formation
- AI serves formation assistance, not replacement of formation

**Implications:**
- Very high risk if not carefully managed
- Human presence is essential for formation
- AI can assist with resources, but not replace relationship
- Boundaries are critical

**Boundaries:**
- AI can assist with formation resources, but not replace formation
- Human presence is essential
- AI serves formation assistance, not replacement of formation relationship

This domain requires the most caution. Formation is about relationship, presence, and transformation. AI can help with resources, but it cannot replace human presence in formation. The boundaries here are critical.

## The Practical Domain

Here's a domain that's often overlooked: the practical domain. This is where AI helps with practical application, implementation, and tools.

**What this includes:**
- Practical application guides
- Implementation tools
- Step-by-step resources
- Practical frameworks
- Action-oriented content

**How AI functions:**
- AI helps with practical tasks and tools
- Human provides practical wisdom, AI helps structure it
- AI serves practical assistance, not replacement of practical wisdom

**Implications:**
- Low to moderate risk
- High efficiency gain
- Transparency helpful but not always critical
- Appropriate with human practical wisdom

**Boundaries:**
- AI assists with practical structure, human provides practical wisdom
- Human maintains responsibility for practical accuracy
- AI serves practical assistance, not replacement of practical experience

This domain is relatively straightforward. AI can help structure practical content, but human practical wisdom is essential. The boundaries are clear.

## Implications Across Domains

Let me synthesize what we're seeing across these domains. Because I think there are some patterns worth noting.

**Pattern 1: Risk increases with sacredness**
- Technical domain: Low risk
- Research domain: Moderate risk
- Creative domain: Moderate to high risk
- Theological domain: High risk
- Formation domain: Very high risk

The more sacred or important the domain, the more careful we need to be.

**Pattern 2: Human oversight is essential in high-risk domains**
- Technical domain: Minimal oversight needed
- Research domain: Evaluation needed
- Creative domain: Creative direction needed
- Theological domain: Theological oversight essential
- Formation domain: Human presence essential

The higher the risk, the more human oversight is required.

**Pattern 3: Specialized agents matter in high-risk domains**
- Technical domain: Generic tools often sufficient
- Research domain: Generic tools can work
- Creative domain: Specialized agents helpful
- Theological domain: Specialized agents essential
- Formation domain: Specialized agents critical

The higher the risk, the more specialized agents matter.

**Pattern 4: Transparency requirements vary by domain**
- Technical domain: Minimal transparency needed
- Research domain: Transparency helpful
- Creative domain: Transparency important
- Theological domain: Transparency critical
- Formation domain: Transparency essential

The higher the risk, the more transparency is required.

## What This Means for Movement Leaders

I want to pause here and speak directly to what this means for you, as a movement leader.

Movement leaders operate across multiple domains. You create theological content. You develop practical resources. You engage in formation work. You do research. You create content.

And AI can help in each domain. But the boundaries, oversight, and transparency requirements vary. Technical tasks require minimal oversight. Theological content requires essential oversight. Formation work requires human presence.

Understanding these domains helps you navigate AI usage well. It helps you set appropriate boundaries. It helps you maintain oversight where needed. It helps you be transparent appropriately.

## A Framework for Domain Navigation

Let me give you a framework for navigating these domains. I think having a framework helps.

**For each domain, ask:**
1. What is the risk level? (Low, moderate, high, very high)
2. What level of human oversight is needed? (Minimal, evaluation, direction, oversight, presence)
3. Do I need specialized agents? (No, helpful, important, essential, critical)
4. What level of transparency is required? (Minimal, helpful, important, critical, essential)

This framework helps you navigate AI usage across domains. It helps you set appropriate boundaries. It helps you maintain oversight. It helps you be transparent.

## A Word of Encouragement

I know this chapter has been about domains and risks and boundaries. And that might feel complicated or overwhelming.

But here's what I want you to know: it's simpler than it sounds. The domains just help us understand that different uses of AI have different implications. The framework just helps us navigate those implications.

You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be thoughtful. You just need to understand the domains, set appropriate boundaries, maintain oversight, and be transparent.

And when you do that, you can use AI well across domains—preserving voice, maintaining credibility, and serving your calling.

## What's Next

In the next chapter, we're going to synthesize what we've learned. We're going to bring together the spectrum of AI involvement, the domains of AI usage, and the principles we've established. We're going to create a comprehensive framework for using AI well as a movement leader.

For now, though, I want you to sit with what we've covered. The domains. The implications. The framework.

These aren't abstract concepts. They're affecting you right now. They're shaping how you use AI, how you create content, how you build credibility. And understanding that reality is the first step toward responding to it well.

So take a breath. Process what we've talked about. And when you're ready, we'll move forward together.

1. In which domains do you most commonly use AI? What does that look like?

2. How do you navigate the different risk levels across domains? What boundaries do you set?

3. Where do you need specialized agents? Where are generic tools sufficient?

4. How does transparency vary across domains for you? What does that look like?

5. What would it look like for you to use the domain navigation framework? How would that help?
