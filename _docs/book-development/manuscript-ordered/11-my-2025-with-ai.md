# Chapter 11: My 2025 with AI

**[Author note: This chapter is a structured placeholder. Fill with (1) a review of how you used AI over the year, (2) the Movemental + Alan Hirsch project as the centerpiece use case—told well—and (3) what this illustrates: amplification not replacement, voice preservation, transparency, human-in-the-loop, building in public. The chapter should ground the framework in a real, detailed example so readers see it in practice.]**

## What This Chapter Needs to Do

- A review of how you used AI over 2025.
- **Centerpiece:** The Movemental + Alan Hirsch project as the single strongest use case you can give—provided it's told well. Include enough concrete detail that readers can see the framework in action: how AI amplified rather than replaced, how voice was preserved, how transparency was maintained, how human oversight and relationship stayed central.
- What this illustrates for the reader: amplification not replacement; voice preservation; transparency; human-in-the-loop; building in public. The framework in practice.

## Suggested Structure

1. **Opening:** Why a use case—and why this one. You're not offering a blueprint; you're offering a proof of concept.
2. **The year in review:** How you used AI across the year (breadth).
3. **The Movemental + Alan Hirsch project:** The centerpiece. What you built, how AI was involved, what stayed human, how you stayed transparent. Enough detail that the framework becomes tangible.
4. **What this illustrates:** Tie back to Ch5–Ch10: credibility amplifier not faker, amplification not replacement, maturity/experimentation, voice, scenius, transparency.
5. **Closing:** Invitation to the reader—your context is different; the principles travel.

## Tone and Voice

- Pastoral and direct. First person. Honest about what worked and what didn't.
- No hype. No platform pitch. Principle-focused; the project illustrates the principles.
- Calm, grounded. This story continues the one from the preface—still learning, still wrong about some things, but staying.
