# Chapter 13: What to Refuse and What We're Free to Do

I want to start this chapter by holding two things together: there are things churches and movements must refuse to do with AI. And there are things they're now ethically free—even obligated—to do. Refusal isn't about rejecting AI. It's about protecting what's sacred. Freedom isn't about using AI everywhere. It's about using it where it serves. Both are necessary.

This chapter also names theological integrity as non-negotiable. When you're creating content about faith, theology, and Christian practice, accuracy and depth aren't optional. AI can help—but it can't replace human oversight and formation. That boundary belongs with the other refusals and freedoms.

## What to Refuse

**Fully automated content publishing.** Content generated by AI without human oversight, published without human review or approval. This removes human judgment, eliminates accountability, erodes voice, and undermines credibility. Refuse it.

**AI-generated content without human review.** AI generates; you publish without evaluation. This removes quality control, undermines theological accuracy, and erodes voice. Refuse it.

**Voice replacement.** Using AI to speak or write as if it were you in contexts where relationship or accountability matter—so that people think they're engaging with you when they're not. This deceives and undermines trust. Refuse it.

**Theological content without human verification.** When you're writing about God, Scripture, faith, or Christian practice, AI can help with structure and research—but theological accuracy, biblical grounding, and doctrinal consistency require human oversight. Content that touches theology must be verified by someone formed in that tradition. Refuse publishing theological content without human verification.

**Deceptive practices.** Presenting AI-generated content as fully your own. Hiding AI involvement when it would matter to your audience. Any practice that misrepresents who or what produced the content. Refuse it.

**Formation work without human presence.** Discipleship, pastoral care, mentoring, spiritual direction—these require embodied presence and real relationship. AI can support the content that serves formation; it cannot replace the human presence that formation requires. Refuse formation work without human presence.

## Theological Integrity as Non-Negotiable

If you're a movement leader creating content about faith, theology, and Christian practice, theological integrity isn't optional. It's non-negotiable.

When you're writing about God, Scripture, faith, or Christian practice, accuracy matters. Theological depth matters. Biblical grounding matters. AI can help you communicate more clearly, reach more people, check consistency—but it can't replace your understanding of Scripture, your theological formation, or your commitment to accuracy. AI assistance must align with movemental theology; human oversight and verification are required. When theological integrity is compromised, people can be misled, credibility erodes, and the sacredness of the subject is dishonored. So theological content without human verification is a refusal. And when you do use AI for theological content, you remain responsible for what gets published.

## What We're Free (or Obligated) to Do

**Use AI for amplification.** Using AI to amplify voice, insight, and impact—to make content more discoverable, to reach more people effectively, to multiply impact—while maintaining voice, preserving credibility, and staying transparent. This isn't just allowed; it serves the calling.

**Preserve voice while gaining efficiency.** Using AI to handle logistics (structure, formatting, variation) while preserving voice. Gaining efficiency without losing distinctiveness. Creating more content sustainably while maintaining authenticity. This serves sustainable ministry and allows leaders to focus on what only they can do.

**Build scenius.** Participating in networks of verified humans who vouch for each other, build on each other's ideas, and create collective authority. Credibility through relationships, not just individual metrics. This is something movement leaders are already good at—and now it's how credibility works.

**Be transparent.** Being honest about when and how AI is involved in content creation. Transparency builds trust in an untrustworthy environment. It's foundational, not optional.

**Use specialized agents within boundaries.** Using AI for specific functions—assistants, archivists, translators—within clear boundaries. Not autonomous creators, but tools that amplify what you provide. This is ethically free when you maintain control and stay transparent.

**Create sustainable content creation workflows.** The 70/30 rule (or whatever ratio fits your context): AI handles what it does well; you provide what only you can provide. Sustainable workflows that preserve voice and integrity. This is good stewardship.

## Holding Refusal and Freedom Together

These aren't contradictory. Refusals protect what's sacred. Freedoms serve what's possible. You refuse fully automated publishing so that you can be free to use AI for amplification with human oversight. You refuse theological content without verification so that you can be free to use AI to help with structure and research while you verify the theology. You refuse formation work without presence so that you can be free to use AI to create content that supports the formation that happens in person.

Acknowledge complexity and nuance. Your context will have its own edges. The point is to have a clear set of refusals—and a clear set of freedoms—so that you can discern well.

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Which refusals are non-negotiable for you? Which would you add?

2. Which freedoms do you feel ready to step into? Which require more experimentation?

3. How do you hold theological integrity as non-negotiable while still using AI where it helps?
