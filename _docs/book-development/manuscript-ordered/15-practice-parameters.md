# Chapter 15: Practice Parameters

I want to start this chapter by giving you the operational shape of "amplification"—what agents are, what ratio looks like, where we live on the spectrum of AI use, and why context and personalization matter. This isn't a how-to manual. It's a set of parameters so you can see what "amplification" looks like in practice.

## Agents as Assistants, Archivists, and Translators

AI agents aren't synthetic personalities or passive tools. They're specialized systems trained for specific functions—content strategy, theological writing, audience adaptation, framework development. They require human oversight and direction.

**Agents as assistants:** They help you structure thinking, refine writing, organize ideas, execute tasks more efficiently. They don't think for you or replace your insight. They assist you in doing your work.

**Agents as archivists:** They preserve your knowledge and insights, organize your content, make your work searchable and accessible. They don't replace your memory or create knowledge for you. This is valuable for movement leaders—years of frameworks and insights—so you can build on it and amplify it.

**Agents as translators:** They adapt content for different audiences, contexts, and formats. They don't replace your voice or your message. They translate it—with your oversight.

**What agents are not:** Synthetic personalities that think and create autonomously. Replacements for human insight or creativity. Systems that operate without human oversight.

## The 70/30 Rule and Sustainable Practice

A practical framework: **70% AI draft, 30% your refinement.** AI handles structure, formatting, variation, expansion. You provide insight, voice, credibility, soul. It's a principle: AI does what it does well; you do what only you can do. That balance preserves your voice while gaining efficiency. Sustainable content creation becomes possible when AI handles logistics and you focus on what only you can do.

## Spectrum and Domains of AI Use

The spectrum runs from no AI use to full AI generation. Most of us will live in the middle—some AI assistance, with human oversight and transparency. Where you sit depends on the domain. Internal drafting might be green; public teaching might be yellow; formation work might be red. Different contexts have different green/yellow/red lights.

**Personalization and context:** Generic AI tools tend to homogenize. For formation-oriented work, generic AI often fails—it doesn't know your movement, your tradition, your people. Context-aware assistance—agents trained on your voice and theology—can preserve voice and integrity. Personalization that preserves voice, not replaces it, is part of the operational shape of amplification.

**Reflection Questions:**

1. How do you think about AI agents—as assistants or as something else?

2. What ratio (AI draft to your refinement) fits your context?

3. Where do you sit on the spectrum in different domains? What are your green, yellow, and red lights?
