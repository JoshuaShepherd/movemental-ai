# Chapter 16: AI and Content Creation

I want to start this chapter by being practical about content creation: the spectrum of AI use, the mostly in-between space we're likely to inhabit, and how transparency and voice preservation work across that spectrum.

## The Spectrum of AI Use in Content Creation

The spectrum runs from no AI use to full AI generation. At one end, you create everything yourself. At the other end, AI generates content and you approve it (that's replacement; for most movement leaders, that's a red light). In between, there's a wide range: AI helps with structure, drafting, refinement, variation. You provide the ideas, the voice, the insight. AI amplifies. You remain the source. Most of us will live in that in-between space.

## What "In-Between" Looks Like in Practice

**Drafting:** You have an idea. You write a rough draft—or you speak it and have it transcribed. AI helps you structure it, expand it, refine it. You revise. You own the voice and the insight. AI amplified; you provided.

**Variation:** You create a piece of content. AI helps you adapt it for different audiences, formats, or contexts. The core content is yours. The variations are yours to approve. Transparency: "I used AI to help me adapt this; the core content and voice are mine."

**Transparency as part of content practice:** Transparency isn't an add-on. When you publish, you're clear about when and how AI was involved. That builds trust. It protects credibility.

**Human review:** Whatever the ratio, content that carries your voice or your theology gets human review. You don't publish AI output unedited. You refine. You verify. You own it.

Different content types may sit at different points on the spectrum. Internal drafts might involve more AI assistance. Public teaching might involve more human refinement. Content that touches formation might sit closer to the "no AI" end. The spectrum is a map. You decide where each type of content sits—and you stay transparent about it.

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Where do your current content types sit on the spectrum?

2. What would "in-between" look like for you in practice?

3. How do you build transparency into your content practice?
