# Chapter 17: AI and Formation and Leadership

Formation happens offline. Spiritual formation, discipleship, character development, theological maturity—these are fundamentally embodied processes that require presence, relationship, time, and the slow work of the Spirit in real lives and real communities. No amount of digital content, no matter how well-crafted or AI-enhanced, can replace the embodied work of formation.

But that invites a question: What might happen online that supports offline formation—both our own formation and the formation of our audiences?

## When AI Serves Formation and When It Undermines It

AI serves formation when it amplifies authentic voice, preserves theological integrity, and creates content that points people toward embodied community and real transformation. AI undermines formation when it replaces human presence, creates the illusion of relationship, or produces content that substitutes for the slow work of discipleship.

Formation requires elements that are fundamentally human: relationship with a mentor or community, accountability, the slow accumulation of wisdom through experience, the work of the Spirit in transforming character. AI cannot provide these. But AI can support the content that formation requires: clear teaching, accessible resources, personalized learning materials, culturally relevant adaptations.

The danger is when AI-assisted content creates the illusion that formation can happen through consumption alone. Formation isn't consumption—it's transformation. And transformation requires the offline elements that AI cannot provide: presence, relationship, accountability, time.

## When AI Serves Leadership and When It Undermines It

AI serves leadership when it frees leaders for relationship and presence—handling logistics, drafting, structure so that leaders can focus on what only they can do: be present, build relationship, form people. AI undermines leadership when it displaces leaders—when it creates the appearance of presence without actual presence, when it substitutes for relationship.

Formation happens offline. AI can support the content that serves that offline work—teaching series that small group leaders use, theologically sound resources that mentors reference, culturally adapted curriculum that local leaders use. In these cases, AI amplifies the leader's voice and expertise. AI undermines formation when it creates content that substitutes for the offline work—generic spiritual content consumed without community, polished materials that create the illusion of expertise without substance.

For your own formation: AI can help you access resources and organize your learning. But your formation still happens offline. For your audiences' formation: AI can help you create content that serves their discipleship. But the content serves the formation; it doesn't create it. Formation happens when people engage with the content in the context of offline community. The distinction: content that supports formation vs. content that replaces it.

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Where have you seen AI serve formation? Where have you seen it undermine formation?

2. How does the content you create point people toward embodied community—or away from it?

3. What would it look like for you to use AI to support formation without substituting for it?
