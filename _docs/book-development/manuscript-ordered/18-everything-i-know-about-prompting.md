# Chapter 18: Everything I Know About "Prompting"

I want to start this chapter by saying what this is not: this is not a prompt-engineering guide. I'm not going to give you formulas to "optimize" your prompts for maximum output. I'm not going to treat AI as a system you engineer. I'm going to treat it as something you're in conversation with—and the way you "prompt" is really just the way you communicate. Clarity, specificity, iteration, and respect go a long way. You don't need to be technical. You need to be clear.

## The Anti-Prompt-Engineering Approach

Prompt engineering often sounds like: use these exact phrases, structure your request this way, optimize for token efficiency, chain your prompts in this sequence. That approach treats AI as a system to be engineered—something you hack, something you optimize. I want to push back. The way we actually interact with AI is mostly written or verbal communication. We're not interfacing with it technically. We're talking to it. So the skills that matter are the skills you already have: clarity, specificity, the ability to refine and iterate, the ability to judge whether a response is helpful or off.

Treating AI humanely means: you're in conversation. You're not engineering a system. You're asking a question, giving context, refining when the answer isn't right, and staying in the driver's seat. You're the one with the insight. You're the one with the voice. AI is helping you think, not thinking for you.

## What Actually Helps: Clarity, Specificity, Iteration

**Clarity:** Say what you want. Not in jargon. In plain language. "Help me structure this section" is clearer than "Optimize the structural coherence of this textual unit." "I need this to sound like me—here's a sample of my writing" is clearer than "Apply voice preservation parameters." The clearer you are, the more useful the response.

**Specificity:** Give context. Who is this for? What's the purpose? What should it avoid? The more specific you are, the less generic the output. "This is for movement leaders who are skeptical of AI" is more useful than "Write for leaders." "Avoid hype; keep it calm and grounded" is more useful than "Make it good."

**Iteration:** You don't have to get it right the first time. Ask. Get a response. If it's off, say how: "That's too generic" or "The tone is wrong—more pastoral, less corporate" or "I need the second paragraph to emphasize X." Iteration is normal. It's how conversation works. You're not failing if you have to refine; you're communicating.

**Staying in the driver's seat:** You're the one who decides what to keep, what to change, what to reject. AI suggests; you choose. When you stay in the driver's seat, you're preserving voice and credibility. When you let AI drive, you're drifting toward replacement. So "prompting" well means: be clear, be specific, iterate, and stay in control. That's not engineering. That's communication.

## What This Means for You

You don't need to become a prompt engineer. You need to communicate clearly—and to treat the system as something you're in conversation with, not something you're optimizing. The same skills that make you a good teacher, a good collaborator, a good writer—clarity, specificity, the willingness to refine—those are the skills that make you good at working with AI. No technical expertise required. Just clarity, specificity, iteration, and the resolve to stay in the driver's seat.

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Where have you struggled to get useful responses from AI? What would clarity or specificity have changed?

2. How do you stay in the driver's seat when using AI—so that you're choosing, not just accepting?

3. What would it look like for you to treat AI as a conversation partner rather than a system to engineer?
