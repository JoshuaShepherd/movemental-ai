# Chapter 21: Where I Am Now

I want to end this book where the preface began: with the story, and with the fact that it isn't over.

I don't have this figured out. I'm still learning. I'm still wrong about things. I'm still discovering what I don't know. I said that at the start, and it's still true. The grappling isn't finished. The trail keeps going.

What I'm holding to: that AI is both problem and solution; that credibility in an AI age is rebuilt through networks and relationships, not through competing with machines on volume or polish; that voice preservation and transparency and boundaries aren't optional; that formation happens offline and that what we do online should support that, not replace it; that slowing down and discerning are responsible, and that you don't have to have it all figured out to lead well.

What I'm still figuring out: how fast the technology will change; how the maturity model will play out in different contexts; how to tell the Movemental and Alan Hirsch story in a way that serves you without becoming a pitch; how to keep this book honest and useful as the landscape shifts. I don't have final answers. I have a framework, a set of refusals and freedoms, and a commitment to keep learning in relationship with others.

So I'm not closing the loop by saying "here's the answer." I'm closing the loop by saying: the story continues. I'm still staying. I'm still learning. And I invite you to do the same—not to have it all figured out, but to stay on the trail, to experiment, to discern, to slow down when you need to, to refuse what you must refuse, and to use what you're free to use, in relationship with others who are figuring it out too.

We're in this together. The future belongs to leaders who embed their work in networks of verified humans while using AI as amplification, not replacement. You don't have to do that alone. You don't have to do it perfectly. You just have to stay—and to keep discerning.

I took the road less traveled. I did it with friends. And that has made all the difference. May it be so for you too.

*This story continues. The grappling isn't finished. I'm still learning. And I'm still glad you're walking with me.*
