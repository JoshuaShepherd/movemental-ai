# Book Voice and Style Guide

**Purpose**: Define the prophetic/pastoral voice sought in this book, how to avoid AI slop and tell-tale AI style, and how to write naturally and humanly within the book’s voice parameters.  
**Audience**: The author, future editors, future AI agents working on the manuscript.  
**Status**: The voice described here is the *target*. It remains to be seen whether the manuscript reliably follows it; this guide is the standard against which to measure and revise.

This document does not outline chapters or summarize content. It defines how the book should sound and how to keep it from sounding generic or machine-generated.

## Part 1: The Prophetic/Pastoral Voice

### 1.1 What We’re Aiming For (and the Caveat)

The book aims for a **prophetic/pastoral** voice: clear, direct, and challenging where it needs to be (prophetic), and warm, attentive, and steady where it needs to be (pastoral). The author speaks as a **guide and fellow traveler**—someone who has been on the trail, has made mistakes, and is still learning. The voice is **calm, grounded, and non-sensational**. It takes the credibility crisis seriously without resorting to panic, hype, or breathless urgency. It can be warm and encouraging and equally clear and challenging, without becoming preachy or casual.

**Caveat:** This is the voice we *seek*. Whether the manuscript reliably achieves it is an open question. Drafts may drift toward generic leadership tone, AI-generated smoothness, or anxious urgency. This guide is the reference for what “right” sounds like so that authors, editors, and agents can compare any passage against it and revise toward it.

### 1.2 Prophetic and Pastoral in This Book

**Prophetic** here does not mean foretelling the future or performing moral superiority. It means:

- **Naming reality clearly.** Saying what is actually happening (e.g., credibility signals are breaking down; trust is under pressure) without softening or exaggerating.
- **Calling out what’s wrong.** Identifying practices or postures that undermine trust, voice, or formation—without shaming the reader.
- **Holding tension.** Refusing to resolve “AI as problem” and “AI as solution” into a simple for/against. The prophetic move is to keep both in view.
- **Speaking to the reader as a responsible agent.** Assuming the reader can handle hard truths and is obliged to discern. No pandering, no flattery.

**Pastoral** here does not mean soft or vague. It means:

- **Acknowledging where the reader is.** Naming that things might feel overwhelming, discouraging, or confusing before moving on. E.g.: “I know this might feel overwhelming. You might be thinking, ‘I just want to share what I’ve learned. Why does this have to be so complicated?’”
- **Addressing the reader directly.** Using “you” and “we” as if in conversation. E.g.: “Here’s what I want you to know”; “Think about what that means for you.”
- **Offering hope without false comfort.** Pointing to a way forward (e.g., scenius, transparency, boundaries) without promising that the crisis will disappear or that adoption of a single tactic will fix everything.
- **Staying grounded and steady.** Not performing anxiety or hype. The pastoral tone is “I see you, and we’re going to work through this” rather than “Everything is fine” or “Everything is doomed.”

**The combination:** Prophetic clarity without cruelty; pastoral warmth without mush. The book names hard things and holds the reader accountable while still addressing them as someone worthy of respect and clarity.

### 1.3 Posture, Tone, and Stance (Recap from Meta-Overview)

- **Posture:** Guide and fellow traveler. The author does not perform omniscience. The author can say “I don’t know” or “we’re still learning” where that is true. Authority rests in part on that honesty.
- **Tone:** Calm, grounded, non-sensational. No panic, no hype, no breathless urgency. Pastoral and prophetic without becoming anxious or preachy.
- **Stance on AI:** Both problem and solution. The book refuses to resolve the tension. It names harms and possibilities and invites the reader to hold both.
- **Stance on the reader:** Responsible agent—capable of discernment, obliged to integrity, entitled to clarity. The book does not talk down, flatter, or manipulate.

### 1.4 Concrete Markers of the Voice

**Sentence rhythm and length:**

- Mix short, declarative sentences with longer, qualified ones. Short sentences land with weight. E.g.: “I did not know anything.” “That’s not a humble admission—it’s a diagnostic reality.”
- Avoid long unbroken chains of medium-length, similarly structured sentences. That creates a monotonous, machine-like rhythm.
- Use the occasional fragment or single-sentence paragraph for emphasis, but sparingly.

**Direct address and reader acknowledgment:**

- Use “I want you to know,” “Here’s what I want you to see,” “I want you to hear this” when introducing a key point. This is direct and pastoral.
- Name the reader’s likely thought or feeling before answering it. E.g.: “You might be thinking, ‘I’ve spent years developing expertise. And now I have to compete with AI?’” Then respond: “I want you to hear this: you’re not competing with AI.”
- Use “we” when the author and reader share the situation. E.g.: “We’re navigating a new landscape”; “the reality we’re navigating.”

**Honest uncertainty:**

- Where true, use “I don’t know,” “we’re still learning,” “it remains to be seen.” E.g.: “I don’t have this figured out. I’m still learning. I’m still wrong about things.”
- Self-correction in the text can signal honesty. E.g.: “About four weeks. No—actually, a week from start to finish.”
- Avoid claiming certainty the book doesn’t have. The voice is more authoritative when it admits limits.

**Signposting:**

- Use clear, simple signposts: “Here’s what’s changed”; “But here’s the problem”; “The good news?”; “First … Second … Third …” when listing reasons or steps.
- Avoid over-signposting (“In this section we will explore …”) or corporate-style transitions (“It is important to note that …”).

**Specificity over abstraction:**

- Prefer concrete examples and specific scenarios over abstract summaries. E.g.: “If you’re a pastor who’s been writing for ten years … your body of work might look small compared to someone who just started using AI last month” rather than “Content creators may find their output compared unfavorably.”
- Use “movement leaders,” “pastors,” “you” in context rather than “stakeholders” or “content producers.”

**Restraint:**

- The book does not need to say everything. It can leave some tension unresolved. It can end a section without a tidy takeaway.
- Avoid stacking three synonyms for emphasis (“clear, transparent, and obvious”). One strong word often suffices.

### 1.5 What the Voice Avoids

- **Preachy:** Moralizing, guilt-tripping, or talking down. The reader is a responsible agent, not a pupil who needs scolding.
- **Casual:** Slang, inside jokes, or a tone that undercuts the gravity of the topic. The book is accessible but not flip.
- **Anxious or urgent:** Breathless pacing, “you must act now,” or fear-driven framing. The book is calm and grounded.
- **Hype:** Overselling AI or the book’s own framework. No “transform your credibility overnight” or “the solution you’ve been waiting for.”
- **Corporate or generic:** “Leverage,” “stakeholders,” “best practices,” “it is important to note,” “in today’s landscape.” The book sounds like a person, not a brand or a textbook.
- **False certainty:** Claiming to know what we don’t, or resolving tensions the book is committed to holding open.

## Part 2: Avoiding AI Slop and Tell-Tale Signs of AI Style

### 2.1 What “AI Slop” Means Here

**AI slop** is prose that is grammatically correct, smooth, and on-topic but that feels generic, interchangeable, or machine-generated. It often has a recognizable texture: samey rhythm, safe word choices, overused phrases, and a lack of the quirks, specificity, and risk that human writing tends to have. For this book, AI slop is especially damaging because the book’s credibility depends on readers trusting that it is the product of a human voice with real stakes—and because the book explicitly argues for voice preservation and against homogenized content. If the manuscript reads like AI slop, it undermines its own message.

### 2.2 Tell-Tale Signs of AI Style (and How to Fix Them)

**Overused openers and transitions:**

- **“It’s important to note that …” / “It’s worth noting that …”** — Delete or replace with a direct statement. E.g.: “Transparency isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s foundational.”
- **“In today’s [landscape/world/environment] …”** — Replace with a concrete, present-tense description. E.g.: “Right now, the mechanisms that used to help people find you are breaking down.”
- **“When it comes to [X], …”** — Often filler. Cut or replace with “Regarding X” or a direct subject. E.g.: “When it comes to credibility” → “Credibility” or “For credibility.”
- **“At the end of the day …” / “When all is said and done …”** — Clichés. Cut or replace with a precise conclusion.
- **“This allows us to …” / “This enables …”** — Corporate. Prefer “We can …” or “So we …” or state the outcome directly.

**Triplet and parallel overuse:**

- AI often generates **three-part lists** or **parallel structures** (noun, noun, and noun; verb, verb, and verb). One or two such structures in a section can work; many in a row feel mechanical.
- **Fix:** Vary structure. Use two items sometimes, four occasionally. Break parallelism: “We need clarity, we need honesty, and we need to stop pretending that volume means expertise.”

**Hedging and filler:**

- **“Certainly,” “Indeed,” “Clearly,” “Obviously”** at the start of sentences — Often unnecessary. If the point is clear, the word is redundant; if not, the word doesn’t fix it.
- **“In order to”** — Prefer “to” unless rhythm demands otherwise.
- **“The fact that”** — Often replace with “that” or rephrase. E.g.: “The fact that AI can replicate these signals” → “That AI can replicate these signals” or “AI can replicate these signals.”
- **“Very,” “really,” “quite,” “somewhat”** — Use sparingly. Prefer stronger verbs or nouns.

**Vague intensifiers and abstractions:**

- **“Deeply,” “truly,” “genuinely,” “authentically”** — Overused in AI writing. Use only when they add meaning; otherwise cut.
- **“Leverage,” “utilize,” “facilitate,” “implement”** — Prefer “use,” “support,” “enable,” “do.”
- **“Robust,” “comprehensive,” “holistic,” “nuanced”** — Jargon. Prefer plain language: “strong,” “full,” “whole,” “subtle” or a concrete description.

**Lack of specificity:**

- AI often summarizes without concrete detail. **“Leaders face many challenges”** is slop; **“If you’re a pastor who’s been writing for ten years, your body of work might look small compared to someone who just started using AI last month”** is specific.
- **Fix:** Add who, what, when, where, or a concrete example. Replace “people” with “movement leaders” or “readers like you” where appropriate.

**Smoothness without friction:**

- Human writing often has small asymmetries: a sentence that’s a bit long, a word that’s slightly unexpected, a transition that’s abrupt but intentional. AI tends to smooth everything into even, predictable rhythm.
- **Fix:** Read aloud. If every sentence has the same “weight” and length, vary it. Add a short punchy sentence. Let one sentence run longer. Use a concrete image or a specific number.

**Repetition of the same phrase across the book:**

- AI-assisted drafts often reuse the same framing phrase in multiple chapters (e.g., “in an AI-saturated world” in every section). The book can use a small set of key phrases (e.g., “amplification not replacement”), but recurring filler phrases make the text feel templated.
- **Fix:** Search for repeated phrases. Keep intentional refrains; replace or cut the rest.

### 2.3 Reputation and Credibility Risks

- **Readers detect AI.** Many readers can sense when prose feels generic or machine-generated. If they suspect the book is largely AI-written without transparent disclosure, trust in the book and in the author’s commitment to “voice preservation” can collapse.
- **The book argues for voice and transparency.** If the manuscript doesn’t sound like a single, distinct human voice—or if it’s full of AI tell-tales—it contradicts the book’s own thesis. The standard for this manuscript is higher than for a generic blog post.
- **Mitigation:** Treat every chapter as something that must pass a “human, singular voice” test. Use this guide and the anti-slop checklist (below) in revision. Prefer human-written or heavily human-revised prose over lightly edited AI output.

### 2.4 Practical Checklist: Stripping AI-Isms

When revising a passage, ask:

1. **Openers:** Can I cut “It’s important to note,” “In today’s world,” “When it comes to,” “At the end of the day”? Replace with a direct statement or a concrete scene.
2. **Triplets:** Are there three parallel items in a row in multiple paragraphs? Vary the number and break the pattern.
3. **Hedging:** Can I remove “certainly,” “indeed,” “clearly,” “in order to,” “the fact that” without losing meaning?
4. **Verbs/nouns:** Did I use “leverage,” “utilize,” “facilitate,” “robust,” “comprehensive,” “holistic”? Replace with plainer, more precise words.
5. **Specificity:** Did I name a specific person, situation, number, or example instead of staying abstract?
6. **Rhythm:** Do my sentences all have similar length and structure? If yes, shorten one, lengthen another, add a fragment or a question.
7. **Repetition:** Is this phrase or structure used in many other chapters? If it’s not an intentional refrain, change it.

## Part 3: Writing Naturally and Humanly Within the Book’s Voice

### 3.1 Goal

The goal is prose that sounds like **one human being**—the author as guide and fellow traveler—speaking to the reader with prophetic clarity and pastoral warmth, without sounding like a committee, a brand, or a language model. The voice is consistent with the parameters in Part 1 and free of the AI tell-tales in Part 2.

### 3.2 Rhythm and Variation

- **Vary sentence length.** Short sentences land. Long sentences can build or qualify. Mix them. Avoid long runs of similar length.
- **Vary sentence type.** Statements, questions, and the occasional imperative (“Think about what that means.” “So take a breath.”) create movement. Don’t overuse rhetorical questions.
- **Use paragraph length for pacing.** Short paragraphs (one to three sentences) create space and emphasis. Longer paragraphs can develop an idea. Don’t default to uniform blocks.
- **Read aloud.** If it sounds like a speech or a conversation, the rhythm is often right. If it sounds like a manual or a press release, revise.

### 3.3 Specificity and Concrete Detail

- **Name things.** “Movement leaders,” “pastors,” “you” (in context), “the reader” — not only “stakeholders” or “content creators.”
- **Use concrete examples.** “If you’re a pastor who’s been writing for ten years …” rather than “Content creators may find …”
- **Use numbers when they help.** “40% to 60% of content,” “68% of internet users” — but only when the numbers are accurate and relevant. Don’t stack statistics for effect.
- **One telling detail beats three generic ones.** E.g.: “I had built one or two React apps—maybe three” is specific and human; “I had built several applications” is generic.

### 3.4 Self-Correction and Honest Uncertainty

- **Self-correction in the text** signals an honest, thinking voice. E.g.: “About four weeks. No—actually, a week from start to finish.” Use sparingly so it stays effective.
- **Admit what you don’t know.** “I don’t have this figured out.” “We’re still learning.” “It remains to be seen.” The book’s authority is partly that it doesn’t claim false certainty.
- **Avoid resolving tension the book is committed to holding.** The book holds “AI as problem” and “AI as solution” together. Don’t slip into “so the answer is …” unless the answer is genuinely “both, and it depends.”

### 3.5 Restraint

- **Don’t overwrite.** One strong image or example often beats three. One clear “here’s what I want you to know” beats a paragraph of throat-clearing.
- **Don’t stack synonyms.** “Clear, transparent, and obvious” — pick one. “Important, significant, and vital” — pick one.
- **Don’t close every loop.** The book can leave some questions open. It can end a section with “We’ll get to that” or with a question the reader is invited to sit with.
- **Don’t flatter or hype.** The reader is a responsible agent. They don’t need “You’re doing important work” in every chapter. They need clarity, framework, and permission to discern.

### 3.6 Staying in Voice: A Revision Checklist

Before considering a passage “done,” check:

1. **Voice:** Does this sound like the same guide and fellow traveler as the preface and Chapter 1? Calm, grounded, direct, warm but not soft?
2. **Prophetic:** Did I name reality clearly? Did I avoid softening or exaggerating? Did I hold tension rather than resolve it into a simple for/against?
3. **Pastoral:** Did I acknowledge where the reader might be (overwhelmed, skeptical, etc.)? Did I address them directly? Did I offer hope without false comfort?
4. **No AI tell-tales:** Did I strip “It’s important to note,” triplet overload, hedging, and vague intensifiers? Did I add specificity and vary rhythm?
5. **Human:** Would a careful reader believe a single person wrote this? Does it have small asymmetries, concrete detail, and honest uncertainty where appropriate?
6. **Restraint:** Did I cut filler, synonyms, and unnecessary closure? Did I leave some tension or question open where that serves the book?

### 3.7 When AI Is Used in the Writing Process

If AI is used to draft, expand, or revise:

- **Treat AI output as raw material, not final prose.** Expect to rewrite for voice, specificity, and rhythm. Use this guide to strip AI-isms and to align with the prophetic/pastoral parameters.
- **Preserve human-written sections.** The preface and any passages that are distinctly the author’s voice should be used as the standard for the rest of the book. Compare AI-assisted passages to those and revise until the voice matches.
- **Disclose in accordance with the book’s own principles.** The book argues for transparency about AI use. How the book was written (e.g., AI-assisted drafting with human revision) should be disclosed in a way consistent with what the book teaches—e.g., in a note on the writing process or in the preface—so that the book models what it asks of readers.
