# Book Writing Moves: Comprehensive Guide

**Date**: January 2026  
**Purpose**: Complete catalog of all writing "moves" - the atomic building blocks that compose chapters and sections in non-fiction books  
**Use**: Reference guide for selecting and combining moves to construct chapters based on your chosen structure

---

## Executive Summary

Just as there are finite book structures and chapter patterns, there are finite **writing moves** - the atomic units that combine to create chapters and sections. A "move" is a discrete rhetorical or structural element that serves a specific function in advancing your argument, engaging your reader, or developing your content.

**Key Finding**: There are approximately **40-50 core moves** that account for the vast majority of content in non-fiction theological/missional books. Understanding these moves allows you to:
- Identify what content you need at each point in your structure
- Select appropriate moves for your purpose
- Combine moves effectively to create compelling chapters
- Work systematically through your book development

**Move Categories**:
1. **Opening Moves** (5-6 moves): How to begin chapters/sections
2. **Narrative Moves** (6-8 moves): Stories, examples, case studies
3. **Analytical Moves** (8-10 moves): Explanation, analysis, argumentation
4. **Practical Moves** (6-8 moves): Application, tools, steps
5. **Transitional Moves** (4-5 moves): Connecting sections and ideas
6. **Evidential Moves** (6-8 moves): Data, research, citations
7. **Closing Moves** (4-5 moves): How to conclude sections/chapters
8. **Structural Moves** (4-5 moves): Framework, organization, integration

## Part 1: Understanding Moves

### What Is a "Move"?

A **move** is a discrete rhetorical or structural element that:
- Serves a specific function (narrative, analytical, practical, etc.)
- Has a recognizable form and pattern
- Can be combined with other moves to create larger units
- Works within different structural contexts
- Has identifiable best practices and common pitfalls

**Examples of Moves**:
- Opening a chapter with a personal story
- Presenting a case study
- Providing biblical grounding
- Making a transition between sections
- Offering practical application steps
- Presenting data or research
- Creating a forward link to the next chapter

### How Moves Work

**Moves Combine**: Multiple moves combine to create sections, sections combine to create chapters, chapters combine to create parts, parts combine to create books.

**Moves Are Contextual**: The same move (e.g., "Personal Story") can serve different functions depending on context:
- Opening move: Hook the reader
- Evidential move: Provide proof
- Illustrative move: Make abstract concrete
- Reflective move: Invite reader identification

**Moves Have Patterns**: Each move has:
- **Purpose**: What it accomplishes
- **Form**: How it's structured
- **Length**: Typical word/page count
- **Placement**: Where it typically appears
- **Best Practices**: How to execute effectively
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid

## Part 2: Opening Moves

### Move 1: Personal Story Opening

**Purpose**: Hook reader with relatable, engaging personal narrative that introduces chapter theme

**Form**:
- **Length**: 2-4 paragraphs (300-600 words)
- **Structure**: Scene-setting → Action/Event → Connection to theme
- **Tone**: Authentic, vulnerable, engaging
- **Placement**: First 1-2 paragraphs of chapter/section

**Best Practices**:
- Start in media res (in the middle of action)
- Use specific, concrete details
- Create emotional connection
- End with implicit or explicit connection to chapter theme
- Make story relevant to reader's experience

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Story too long (dominates chapter)
- Story not clearly connected to theme
- Generic or clichéd story
- Story that makes author look too good/perfect
- Story that doesn't resonate with target audience

**Example Opening**:
> "George was a drug dealer when he came to faith. I remember the day he walked into our inner-city community in Melbourne, looking for something—though he didn't know what. Within six months, he had led fifty people to faith, using only his mother's King James Bible and a video about end-times prophecy. This story illustrates something profound about disciple making that we've largely forgotten..."

**When to Use**:
- Personal journey books
- Chapters that need emotional engagement
- Making abstract concepts concrete

- Follow question with context for why it matters

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Generic questions ("Have you ever wondered...?")
- Questions that don't lead anywhere
- Too many questions (overwhelming)
- Questions that are too abstract
- Questions that don't connect to reader

**Example Opening**:
> "How is it possible that the early church grew from 25,000 believers in AD 100 to 20 million by AD 310—without buildings, without printed Scriptures, without professional leadership? This question haunts me because it reveals something about the nature of authentic Christian movement that we've lost. If we could answer this question, we might discover the forgotten ways of apostolic genius..."

**When to Use**:

**Example Opening**:
> *"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us."* — John 1:14
>
> This declaration from John's Gospel captures something essential about how God works in the world. The incarnation isn't just something that happened 2,000 years ago—it's the ongoing pattern for how God engages with creation. When we understand this, it changes everything about how we think about mission, church, and our calling...

> "The Western church faces three simultaneous crises that threaten its very existence. First, a spiritual crisis: we're producing consumers, not disciples. Second, a missiological crisis: we're reaching fewer people each year despite more resources. Third, an ecclesiological crisis: we're maintaining institutions rather than catalyzing movements. These crises aren't separate—they're symptoms of a deeper problem. If we don't address this now, we risk becoming irrelevant to the very people Jesus called us to reach..."

This confession, the earliest and most central of Christian declarations, gates everything else. When we receive this indicative—that Jesus is indeed Lord of all—we are compelled toward a communal imperative: practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood. This chapter explores what happens when this truth becomes the organizing center of our life together..."
