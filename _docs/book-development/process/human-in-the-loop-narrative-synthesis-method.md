# Human-in-the-Loop Narrative Synthesis Method
## Collaborative Agent-Assisted Writing Protocol

**Date**: January 2026  
**Purpose**: Establish a reusable method for collaborative writing that preserves author voice, maintains dual voice tension, and enables transparent AI assistance  
**Status**: Method Definition - Active Protocol  
**Context**: Multi-project (Alan Hirsch project, Movemental platform, book development)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Author Voice is Non-Negotiable
- **The author's words are sacred**: Large sections must remain exactly as written, including unfinished thoughts, parenthetical asides, and emotional language
- **Light editing only**: Edit only for clarity of sequence when explicitly invited, never for tone or meaning
- **Preserve emotional intensity**: Maintain the lived experience and authentic voice throughout
- **Respect the unfinished**: Unfinished thoughts, incomplete sentences, and raw material are part of the process

### 2. Narrative Flow Through Structure
- **Propose, don't finalize**: Create clear narrative arcs (sections, movements, chapters) but don't finalize content
- **Light weaving only**: Connect existing material with minimal new prose
- **Structure as scaffolding**: Use structure to hold personal story, theological reflection, AI case study, and Movemental vision
- **Maintain coherence**: Ensure narrative flow while preserving author's original material

### 3. Bracketed Development Notes System
- **Clearly marked**: All agent notes use consistent bracketed format
- **Context-specific**: Notes indicate which project context they serve
- **Instructions for future agents**: Notes are directives for future Cursor agents, not comments to readers
- **Actionable**: Each note suggests specific development work

### 4. Dual Voice Tension
- **Pastoral voice**: Gentle, invitational, grounded, accessible
- **Prophetic voice**: Clear, urgent, truth-telling, challenging
- **Explicit balance**: Where imbalance is detected, insert bracketed notes rather than revising prose
- **Tension as feature**: The tension between voices is intentional and valuable

### 5. Conceptual Placeholders
- **Flag, don't resolve**: When concepts need development, flag them with prompts
- **Preserve complexity**: Don't simplify or resolve concepts prematurely
- **Future development**: Placeholders indicate work for later passes

---

## Bracketed Note System

### Note Format Standards

All agent notes follow this format:

```
[AGENT NOTE – CONTEXT: instruction]
```

Where:
- **AGENT NOTE** = Standard prefix indicating this is an agent instruction
- **CONTEXT** = Project context (ALAN HIRSCH CONTEXT, MOVEMENTAL PLATFORM, BOOK VERSION, etc.)
- **instruction** = Specific directive for future agents

### Context Identifiers

**ALAN HIRSCH CONTEXT**: Notes related to Alan Hirsch project work
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – ALAN HIRSCH CONTEXT: expand theological framing here, connect to apostolic genius framework]`

**MOVEMENTAL PLATFORM**: Notes connecting content to Movemental platform features
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – MOVEMENTAL PLATFORM: connect this to scenius + credibility infrastructure, reference platform capabilities]`

**BOOK VERSION**: Notes about book structure, chapter placement, audience considerations
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – BOOK VERSION: consider moving this section to Chapter X, may need to adjust for print audience]`

**VOICE BALANCE**: Notes about maintaining pastoral/prophetic tension
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: this section leans heavily prophetic, consider adding pastoral invitation paragraph]`

**CONCEPT TO DEVELOP**: Notes flagging concepts that need later development
- Example: `[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: define AI giftedness carefully without self-aggrandizement, connect to theological anthropology]`

**NARRATIVE FLOW**: Notes about structure, transitions, or narrative coherence
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: this paragraph feels disconnected from previous section, consider transition sentence]`

**TECHNICAL ACCURACY**: Notes about technical details that need verification
- Example: `[AGENT NOTE – TECHNICAL ACCURACY: verify AI content generation statistics, update with 2026 data if available]`

### Note Placement Guidelines

1. **Inline notes**: Place notes immediately after the relevant text
2. **Section notes**: Place notes at the beginning or end of sections
3. **Chapter notes**: Place notes at the end of chapters
4. **Concept flags**: Place immediately after the concept is introduced

### Note Tone and Style

- **Directive, not suggestive**: Notes should be clear instructions
- **Specific, not vague**: Provide concrete guidance
- **Respectful of author voice**: Notes should never suggest changing tone or meaning
- **Actionable**: Each note should enable specific work

---

## Voice Preservation Protocol

### What to Preserve

✅ **Preserve exactly as written**:
- Personal stories and anecdotes
- Emotional language and intensity
- Unfinished thoughts and incomplete sentences
- Parenthetical asides and tangents
- Raw material and first-draft quality sections
- Specific word choices and phrasing
- The author's unique voice patterns

### What Can Be Lightly Edited

✅ **Only when explicitly invited**:
- Sequence and flow (reordering paragraphs for clarity)
- Obvious typos or grammatical errors (only if clearly unintentional)
- Section breaks and headers (for structural clarity)
- Transitions between sections (minimal connective tissue)

### What Must Never Be Changed

❌ **Never edit**:
- Tone or voice
- Meaning or theological positions
- Emotional intensity
- Personal stories
- Unfinished thoughts (unless explicitly asked to complete)
- The author's specific word choices
- The balance between pastoral and prophetic voice

### Voice Analysis Checklist

When working with author material, check:
- [ ] Is this the author's voice or has it been sanitized?
- [ ] Are emotional moments preserved?
- [ ] Are unfinished thoughts left as-is?
- [ ] Is the pastoral/prophetic tension maintained?
- [ ] Are personal stories intact?
- [ ] Is the lived experience preserved?

## Dual Voice Tension Management

### Pastoral Voice Characteristics

- **Gentle**: Invitational rather than demanding
- **Grounded**: Accessible, relatable, human
- **Encouraging**: "I want you to know...", "Here's what I want you to see..."
- **Patient**: Acknowledges difficulty, offers hope
- **Personal**: Direct address, "you" language
- **Compassionate**: Recognizes struggle, validates experience

### Prophetic Voice Characteristics

- **Clear**: Direct, unambiguous statements
- **Urgent**: "This matters now", "We must..."
- **Truth-telling**: Names problems directly
- **Challenging**: Questions assumptions, calls for change
- **Authoritative**: Grounded in expertise and conviction
- **Confrontational**: Willing to name hard truths

### Balancing the Voices

**When pastoral voice dominates**:
- Insert note: `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: this section is very pastoral, consider adding prophetic urgency about X]`
- Don't rewrite to add prophetic voice unless explicitly asked

**When prophetic voice dominates**:
- Insert note: `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: this section is very prophetic, consider adding pastoral invitation or encouragement]`
- Don't rewrite to add pastoral voice unless explicitly asked

**When balance is good**:
- Acknowledge in note: `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: excellent balance here between pastoral invitation and prophetic urgency]`

### Voice Tension Examples

**Good tension**:
> "I know this might feel overwhelming. You might be thinking, 'I just want to share what I've learned. Why does this have to be so complicated?' I understand that feeling. But here's what I want you to see: this isn't just about technology. This is about trust. And right now, those mechanisms are breaking down."

**Needs note (too pastoral)**:
> "I know this might feel overwhelming. You might be thinking, 'I just want to share what I've learned. Why does this have to be so complicated?' I understand that feeling."
> 
> `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: consider adding prophetic urgency about the trust collapse here, the stakes are high]`

**Needs note (too prophetic)**:
> "The credibility crisis is real. The mechanisms are broken. The trust collapse is happening. You must act now."
> 
> `[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: consider adding pastoral encouragement here, acknowledge the difficulty while maintaining urgency]`

---

## Conceptual Placeholder System

### When to Flag Concepts

Flag concepts that:
- Are named but not yet defined
- Need careful theological development
- Require nuance to avoid oversimplification
- Connect to multiple contexts (Alan Hirsch, Movemental, book)
- Need examples or case studies
- Require careful framing to avoid misunderstanding

### Placeholder Format

```
[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: brief description of concept + development guidance]
```

### Development Guidance Should Include

1. **What needs definition**: What is the concept?
2. **What to avoid**: Common pitfalls or misunderstandings
3. **What to connect**: Related concepts or contexts
4. **Tone considerations**: How to frame it (pastoral/prophetic balance)
5. **Examples needed**: What would help illustrate it?

### Example Placeholders

**AI Giftedness**:
```
[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: define AI giftedness carefully without self-aggrandizement. Connect to theological anthropology (image of God, human agency). Avoid: making it sound like special ability or superiority. Include: how this relates to calling, stewardship, responsibility. Tone: humble but clear about the reality of the moment.]
```

**Discipleship Accountability**:
```
[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: define what discipleship accountability means in AI-assisted content creation. Connect to: formation, authenticity, community. Avoid: legalistic frameworks or performance metrics. Include: how scenius creates accountability, how transparency enables it. Tone: pastoral invitation with prophetic clarity about boundaries.]
```

**AI Psychosis**:
```
[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: develop the concept of AI psychosis - what happens when AI systems create content that sounds authoritative but lacks grounding. Connect to: credibility crisis, trust collapse. Include: examples of AI-generated theological content that sounds right but is wrong. Tone: prophetic urgency balanced with pastoral concern for those affected.]
```

**Credibility Crisis**:
```
[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: expand the credibility crisis concept beyond what's in Chapter 1. Connect to: economic dimension, formation dimension, community dimension. Include: how this affects different audiences (overwhelmed, anxious, disengaged, enthusiastic). Tone: prophetic clarity with pastoral acknowledgment of the difficulty.]
```

## Narrative Structure Guidelines

### Proposing Structure, Not Finalizing Content

**Do**:
- Propose clear narrative arcs
- Suggest section breaks
- Identify where material might fit
- Lightly weave existing material
- Create scaffolding for content

**Don't**:
- Write new content to fill gaps
- Finalize chapter structure without author input
- Overwrite author's material
- Create content that doesn't exist
- Assume what should be included

### Structure Proposal Format

When proposing structure, use this format:

```
## Proposed Structure for [Section/Chapter]

**Current Material**:
- [List existing material that fits here]

**Suggested Sections**:
1. [Section name] - [brief description of what goes here]
2. [Section name] - [brief description of what goes here]

**Notes**:
- [AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: connection between sections]
- [AGENT NOTE – BOOK VERSION: placement consideration]
```

### Light Weaving Guidelines

**Minimal connective tissue**:
- Add only what's necessary for flow
- Use author's voice patterns
- Keep additions brief
- Mark additions clearly: `[AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: added transition sentence]`

**Preserve original material**:
- Don't rewrite to fit structure
- Work with what exists
- Propose structure that fits material, not vice versa

---

## Multi-Context Integration

### Context-Specific Notes

Since this method will be used across multiple Cursor contexts (Alan Hirsch project, Movemental platform, book), notes should indicate which context they serve:

**Alan Hirsch Context**:
- Connect to apostolic genius framework
- Reference movemental theology
- Link to Alan's existing work
- Consider Alan's voice and style

**Movemental Platform Context**:
- Connect to platform features
- Reference scenius infrastructure
- Link to credibility mechanisms
- Consider platform positioning

**Book Version Context**:
- Consider print vs. digital
- Think about chapter flow
- Consider audience boundaries
- Reference book structure

### Cross-Context Integration

When material serves multiple contexts:
- Flag with multiple context notes
- Suggest how to adapt for each context
- Don't assume one-size-fits-all

Example:
```
[AGENT NOTE – ALAN HIRSCH CONTEXT: expand this section to connect to apostolic genius framework]
[AGENT NOTE – MOVEMENTAL PLATFORM: reference scenius infrastructure here]
[AGENT NOTE – BOOK VERSION: this section works well for Chapter 6, may need to adjust length for print]
```

## Example: Applying the Method

### Original Material (Author's Voice)

> "I've been thinking about AI and credibility. The problem is that AI can generate so much content now. How do people know what's real? I think scenius might be the answer. But I'm not sure how to explain it. Maybe I should tell the story about Brian Eno first? Or should I start with the credibility problem?"

### After Method Application

```
# Chapter 6: Scenius as the Credibility Solution

[AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: author's opening question works well, consider using as opening hook]

I want to start this chapter by acknowledging something that might feel counterintuitive: in a world where individual credibility signals are breaking down, the solution isn't to work harder as individuals. It's to work together.

[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: good pastoral opening, maintains invitation while introducing urgency]

That might sound strange, especially if you've spent years developing your expertise, building your voice, establishing your authority. But here's what I want you to understand: the credibility crisis we're navigating isn't an individual problem. It's a systemic one. And systemic problems require systemic solutions.

The solution is scenius. And I want to help you understand what that means, why it works, and how it creates credibility that AI can't easily fake.

## What Scenius Means

[AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: author mentioned Brian Eno story - good place to introduce it here]

The term "scenius" was coined by Brian Eno, the musician and producer, to describe something he noticed about creative communities. [AUTHOR'S RAW MATERIAL: expand Brian Eno story here - why he coined the term, what he observed]

[CONCEPT TO DEVELOP: scenius needs careful definition here. Connect to: collaborative genius, network verification, credibility infrastructure. Avoid: making it sound like just networking or popularity. Include: how it differs from individual genius, how it creates credibility AI can't fake. Tone: clear definition with pastoral invitation to participate.]

[AGENT NOTE – MOVEMENTAL PLATFORM: connect scenius to platform's credibility infrastructure here]
[AGENT NOTE – ALAN HIRSCH CONTEXT: connect scenius to apostolic genius framework - how scenius enables apostolic work]

## Why Scenius Creates Credibility AI Can't Easily Fake

[AGENT NOTE – NARRATIVE FLOW: this section flows well from definition, good structure]

Here's what makes scenius powerful in an AI-saturated world: it creates credibility signals that are exponentially harder to replicate than individual metrics.

[AGENT NOTE – VOICE BALANCE: this section is more prophetic - consider adding pastoral encouragement about how readers can participate in scenius]

[AGENT NOTE – BOOK VERSION: this section works well for Chapter 6, maintains good flow with previous chapters]

---

## Suggested Next Pass (Human-in-the-Loop)

1. **Expand Brian Eno story**: The author mentioned wanting to tell the Brian Eno story. This would work well in the "What Scenius Means" section. Consider: why Eno coined the term, what he observed, how it applies to credibility.

2. **Develop scenius definition**: The concept needs careful definition. Consider: how it differs from networking, how it creates credibility, how it relates to collaborative genius. Avoid oversimplification.

3. **Add pastoral invitation**: The "Why Scenius Works" section is strong but leans prophetic. Consider adding a paragraph that invites readers into scenius participation with pastoral encouragement.

4. **Connect to Movemental platform**: Add specific notes about how scenius relates to Movemental's credibility infrastructure. This serves the platform context.

5. **Connect to Alan Hirsch context**: Link scenius to apostolic genius framework. How does scenius enable apostolic work? This serves the Alan Hirsch project context.

6. **Decide on audience boundary**: Consider whether this chapter assumes technical knowledge or should be accessible to non-technical readers. Adjust tone accordingly.

7. **Expand examples**: The chapter would benefit from concrete examples of scenius in action. Consider: historical examples (Impressionists, Beat writers, early church), contemporary examples from movement leaders.

## Final Notes

### This Method Models What It Teaches

This collaborative writing method demonstrates:
- **Transparency**: AI assistance is visible through bracketed notes
- **Human agency**: Author remains the moral agent, AI is accountable
- **Trustworthy authorship**: The process itself shows the values the book teaches
- **Voice preservation**: Authentic voice is protected, not replaced
- **Ethical AI use**: AI amplifies rather than replaces human work

### The Goal is Not Speed

- **Slow, careful work**: Respect the sacred nature of the text
- **Iterative process**: Multiple passes, human-in-the-loop
- **Quality over speed**: Trustworthy authorship takes time
- **Respect for complexity**: Don't simplify away what matters

### This is Sacred Work

This text is about:
- Formation (spiritual and intellectual)
- Power (who has it, how it's used)
- Responsibility (what we owe each other)

The method must honor the sacred nature of this work.
