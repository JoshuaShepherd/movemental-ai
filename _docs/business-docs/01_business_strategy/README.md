## Scope
Business model design, pricing, market definition, and launch sequencing for the Movemental network. This pillar houses the 11-part business plan, go-to-market playbooks, monetization models, and stand-alone briefs such as the perfect launch playbook, selling points, and one-liner guide.

## Key Artifacts
- `business_plan/` – canonical 11-section strategy narrative.
- `business_model/` – revenue design, share models, trust-first frameworks.
- `financial_analysis/` – monetization math, valuation rebuttals, IP analysis.
- `go_to_market/` – pricing, qualification gates, conversion analysis.
- Root briefs: `perfect-launch-playbook.md`, `selling-points.md`, `product-service-definition.md`, `one-liner-guide.md`.

## Maintenance
- Revisit quarterly or when pricing/offer changes occur.
- Cross-link updates with `_docs/05_leadership_ops/strategic-narrative.md` and `_docs/02_product_platform/architecture/WHAT_WE_BUILT.md`.
- Document major revisions in `_docs/00_foundation/changelog.md`.
