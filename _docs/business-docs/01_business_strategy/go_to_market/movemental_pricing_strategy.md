## Movemental Leaders: Revolutionary Pricing Model

### Core Offerings

1. **Complete Digital Publishing Platforms**
   - Custom-built React/Next.js sites with integrated AI agents
   - Features: subscription/paywall, content management, video/text integration, analytics dashboard, AI-assisted composition tools
   - Designed to rival (and surpass) Substack, Squarespace, or traditional publishers — but at a fraction of the cost

2. **AI Publishing Companions**
   - Templatized AI agents (drafting, editing, course creation)
   - Deployed within the platform to increase output and diversify content formats

3. **Movemental Leader Network**
   - Informal network of leaders who share analytics, learnings, and best practices
   - Collective intelligence for digital publishing in the movemental space

### Pricing Structure (Revolutionary)
- **Initial Build**: $1,000 flat fee
- **Ongoing Partnership**: 10% of future revenue earned via the platform

### Strategic Rationale
- **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Agencies charge $50k–$150k for comparable platforms, pricing out most movemental leaders
- **SaaS Disruption**: Traditional tools charge $1,000+ per year but don't integrate publishing, analytics, and AI
- **Ownership Model**: Movemental leaders retain their content, audience, and revenue (90% vs. industry standard 15%)
- **Network Effects**: Each successful leader becomes a referral source and collaboration partner

This model creates unprecedented access to professional-grade publishing tools while building a sustainable revenue-sharing partnership.
