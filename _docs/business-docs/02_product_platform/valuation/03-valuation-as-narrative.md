## Section 1: Valuation as Narrative—A Framework for Understanding

### The Fundamental Insight: Valuation Is a Story

Before diving into Movemental's specific numbers, it's essential to
understand that **valuation is not a fixed number extracted from a
formula—it's a negotiated story about future value creation**. This
perspective, central to how HBS teaches valuation, changes everything
about how we approach the exercise.

#### Why Narrative Matters

In traditional finance education, you learn formulas:

- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): Sum of future cash flows discounted to
  present value
- Comparable Company Analysis (Comps): Market value based on similar
  companies
- Precedent Transactions: What buyers have paid for similar assets

These are tools, not truth. The truth is that **valuation is
fundamentally about convincing someone (an investor, acquirer, or
internal stakeholder) that your company will create value worth \$X**.

The formula tells part of the story. The narrative tells what makes your
formula credible—and why someone should believe in the assumptions
embedded within it.

#### The Three Components of a Compelling Valuation Narrative

**1. The Opportunity Story**

- What problem are you solving?
- How large is the addressable market?
- Why is now the right time?

**2. The Advantage Story**

- Why will you capture this opportunity (not competitors)?
- What moats protect your position?
- How do these advantages strengthen over time?

**3. The Execution Story**

- Can you actually deliver on the opportunity?
- What milestones demonstrate progress?
- How do early wins compound into sustainable advantage?

#### Applying This Framework to Movemental

Movemental's valuation story is particularly compelling because it
combines:

- **Large corrected TAM** (5M-15M potential readers, not 50K-100K)
- **Defensible network effects** (mathematical amplification that
  compounds with scale)
- **Proven creator economics** (validated playbooks from Substack,
  Patreon, etc.)
- **Early validation** (Alan Hirsch platform live, Brad Brisco in
  pipeline)

The numbers we calculate below are meaningless without this narrative
foundation. But the narrative is also incomplete without numbers that
demonstrate the math works.
