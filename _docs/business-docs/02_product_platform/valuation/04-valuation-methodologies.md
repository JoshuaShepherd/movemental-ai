## Section 2: Understanding Valuation Methodologies

### Introduction to Valuation Approaches

For those new to valuation, here are the primary frameworks
professionals use:

#### 1. Market Approach (Comparable Companies)

**The Logic**: If similar companies trade at 10x revenue, and we're
similar, we might be worth 10x our revenue.

**How It Works**:

- Identify comparable public companies or recent transactions
- Calculate valuation multiples (revenue, EBITDA, users, etc.)
- Apply those multiples to your metrics
- Adjust for differences (growth rate, profitability, market position)

**Example for Movemental**:

- Substack: Private valuation suggests ~15x revenue for creator
  platforms
- Patreon: Similar platform economics, ~12x revenue multiple
- SaaS companies with network effects: 15-25x revenue

**Limitations**:

- Requires truly comparable companies (hard for unique businesses)
- Multiples change with market conditions
- Doesn't capture unique competitive advantages

#### 2. Income Approach (Discounted Cash Flow)

**The Logic**: A company is worth the present value of all future cash
flows.

**How It Works**:

- Project cash flows 5-10 years forward
- Estimate a "terminal value" (what the company is worth at the end of
  the projection period)
- Discount everything back to present value using a discount rate (cost
  of capital)

**Why It Matters for Movemental**:

- Captures the value of recurring revenue streams
- Accounts for growth trajectory
- Requires explicit assumptions about future performance

**Limitations**:

- Highly sensitive to assumptions (small changes = large valuation
  swings)
- Difficult to project long-term for rapidly evolving businesses
- Doesn't account for strategic value beyond cash flows

#### 3. Cost Approach (Asset-Based)

**The Logic**: Company is worth what it would cost to build from
scratch.

**How It Works**:

- Value tangible assets (equipment, cash, etc.)
- Value intangible assets (technology, brand, relationships)
- Subtract liabilities

**Why It's Relevant**:

- Provides a "floor" valuation (minimum worth)
- Useful for early-stage companies with few revenues

**Limitations**:

- Doesn't capture growth potential
- Ignores network effects and platform value
- Often significantly undervalues technology companies

### The Multiplier Approach: Understanding Revenue and EBITDA Multiples

**What is a multiple?**

A multiple is a ratio expressing value relative to a financial metric.
For example:

- **Revenue Multiple**: Company valued at \$100M with \$10WM revenue =
  10x revenue multiple
- **EBITDA Multiple**: Company valued at \$100M with \$5M EBITDA = 20x
  EBITDA multiple

**Why do multiples vary?**

1.  **Growth Rate**: Fast-growing companies command higher multiples
2.  50%+ growth rate: 20-30x revenue
3.  20-30% growth rate: 10-15x revenue
4.  \<10% growth rate: 3-8x revenue

<!-- -->

1.  **Profitability**: Higher margins = higher multiples
2.  40%+ EBITDA margin: Premium multiple
3.  20-30% margin: Standard multiple
4.  Negative margin (growth stage): Revenue-based multiple only

<!-- -->

1.  **Market Position**: Category leaders trade at premiums
2.  Category-defining: +50-100% premium
3.  Strong \#2: Standard multiple
4.  Also-ran: Discount to standard

<!-- -->

1.  **Defensibility**: Strong moats = higher multiples
2.  Network effects: +30-50% premium
3.  Strong brand: +20-30% premium
4.  Commoditized: Discount to standard

<!-- -->

1.  **Market Conditions**: Investor sentiment affects multiples
2.  Bull market (2020-2021): Premium multiples
3.  Bear market (2022-2023): Discounted multiples
4.  Market recovery: Normalizing multiples

### For SaaS and Platform Companies Specifically

**Revenue Multiples for SaaS/Platforms**:

| Growth Rate | Annual Recurring Revenue Multiple |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| \>100%      | 25-40x ARR                        |
| 50-100%     | 15-25x ARR                        |
| 30-50%      | 10-15x ARR                        |
| 20-30%      | 8-12x ARR                         |
| 10-20%      | 5-8x ARR                          |
| \<10%       | 3-5x ARR                          |

**Network Effect Premium**: +3-5x revenue for platforms with strong
network effects (LinkedIn, Airbnb, etc.)

**Recurring Revenue Premium**: Companies with \>80% recurring revenue
trade at 20-40% premium vs. transactional businesses

### Applying Multiple Analysis to Movemental

Movemental's valuation will be driven by:

1.  **Recurring Revenue Growth**: 10% revenue share creates predictable
    recurring income
2.  **Network Effect Premium**: Documented 16x-16,000x amplification
    provides defensible moat
3.  **Category Creation**: First-mover in "movemental publishing
    platform" category
4.  **Mission Alignment**: Lower churn, higher loyalty from aligned
    incentives

These factors suggest Movemental should trade at **premium multiples**
(12-18x revenue) once recurring revenue scales, rather than standard
SaaS multiples (8-12x).
