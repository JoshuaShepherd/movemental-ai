## Section 4: Valuation at Key Milestones

<div class="callout"
style="background: #e6f3ff; border-left:луб 4pt solid #1a5f96; padding: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

### 📊 Valuation Visualizations

All valuations reflect \$10,000 average creator revenue baseline:

- **Valuation Trajectory**: Growth from \$2M-\$5M (prototype) to
  \$12M-\$15M (1,000 users)
- **Scenario Comparison**: Base case valuations at \$10K baseline vs.
  conservative floor

</div>

### Methodology Overview

For each milestone, we calculate valuation using multiple approaches:

1.  **Revenue Multiple Approach**: Applying platform/SaaS multiples
    mandate years since recurring revenue model
2.  **DCF Approach**: Projecting cash flows and discounting to present
    value
3.  **Comparable Transactions**: Recent platform acquisitions and
    funding rounds
4.  **Strategic Value**: Acquirer willingness-to-pay for network effects
    and category position

We present a **valuation range** for each milestone, acknowledging that:

- Early-stage valuations have wider ranges (more uncertainty)
- Later milestones have tighter ranges (more validation data)
- Market conditions affect multiples (we use normalized, mid-cycle
  assumptions)

  then market expansion)
- **Platform Multiple Range**: 12-18x ARR for category-leading platforms
  with network effects
- Network effect premium: +3-5x multiple
- Category leadership premium: +2-3x multiple
- Recurring revenue strength: 95%+ of revenue is recurring
- **Calculation**: \$8.1M × 14-18x = **\$113M-\$146M**

**B. DCF Approach**:

- **Year 1-2 Projections**: \$8.1M → \$15M (500 → 750 users + revenue
  per user growth)
- **Year 3-4 Projections**: \$15M → \$25M (750 → 1,000 users + market
  expansion)
- **Year 5+ Terminal Value**: Based on 1,000-user maturity + expansion
  opportunities
- 1,000 users: \$9.5M ARR (conservative)
- Movement organizations revenue: \$5M-\$10M ARR (future expansion)
