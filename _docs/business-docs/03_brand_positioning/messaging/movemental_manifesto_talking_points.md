# The Movemental Manifesto
## Stories, Vision, and Talking Points for Platform Pioneers

**Date**: September 25, 2025  
**Purpose**: Core messaging framework for early conversations about Movemental  
**Audience**: Movemental leaders considering platform ownership

---

## 🌱 **The Story We're Telling**

### **Where We Started**

"I've spent years watching movemental leaders—the ones catalyzing real change in communities, pioneering incarnational theology, multiplying movements—get trapped in digital sharecropping. They pour their hearts into platforms that own their audience, control their content, and capture 85% of their economic value.

Meanwhile, if they want true platform ownership, they're looking at $50,000-$150,000 and 6-12 months of development. It's accessible to megachurches and major organizations, but not to the movemental leaders who are actually advancing God's kingdom on the ground.

That felt prophetically wrong to me."

### **What We're Building**

"Movemental is an invitation-only collective of movemental leaders who are pioneering platform ownership. We're creating the infrastructure for movements to multiply in the digital age—not through rented space on others' platforms, but through owned, connected, AI-integrated publishing platforms that serve the leader's calling while advancing collaborative kingdom impact.

This isn't just about websites. It's about changing how movements multiply."

### **Why Now**

"The technology has finally caught up to the vision. AI can handle the complexity that used to require six-figure development budgets. We can build genuinely impressive platforms in weeks, not months. And the movemental community is ready—tired of digital sharecropping, hungry for authentic connection, and prepared to invest in tools that align with their values."

## 💰 **How We Talk About Pricing**

### **The Revolutionary Economics**

"Here's what we're doing differently: Instead of charging market rates upfront and walking away, we're charging $1,000 to build your platform and then taking 10% of what you earn through it. We succeed when you succeed. Our incentives are completely aligned.

Compare that to Substack, where you keep 15% and they keep 85%. Or to traditional development, where you pay $75,000 upfront and hope it works."

### **The Scaling Story**

"We're starting with founding members at $1,000, then moving to $2,000 for the next cohort, eventually reaching $3,000-$4,000 for the final spots. Why? Because network effects make each membership more valuable over time. The 100th member gets access to 99 other movemental leaders' audiences, collaboration opportunities, and shared intelligence. That's worth more than what the 10th member received.

But everyone who joins early gets grandfathered at their price point forever."

### **The Value Proposition**

"Think about it this way: If your platform helps you earn an extra $20,000 annually through courses, coaching, or content subscriptions, you're paying us $2,000 in revenue share. You keep $18,000. That's a 900% return on your $1,000 investment in year one alone.

Most of our members are seeing platform earnings that far exceed that within six months."

## 🎯 **The 1,000 Member Vision**

### **Why We're Capping at 1,000**

"We're intentionally capping Movemental at 1,000 members because we want to build infrastructure, not scale infinitely. When every significant movemental leader globally owns their platform and they're all connected for collaboration and cross-promotion, we've accomplished the mission.

At 1,000 members, the network effects are incredible. You're not just getting a platform—you're getting access to the definitive movemental leader ecosystem."

### **What 100 Members Looks Like**

"At 100 members, you're part of a tight-knit collective where everyone knows everyone's work. You can collaborate on projects, cross-promote each other's content, and share insights about what's working. It feels like the best ministry conference you've ever attended, but it's happening constantly through your platform.

Plus, you're early enough that you have real influence on how the network develops."

### **What 1,000 Members Looks Like**

"At 1,000 members, Movemental becomes the movemental leader infrastructure. Need to find someone working on incarnational community development in urban contexts? They're in the network. Want to collaborate on a project about racial reconciliation and church planting? You have instant access to the leading practitioners.

Your content gets seen by the audiences of hundreds of aligned leaders. Your courses get recommended by people whose endorsement actually matters. Your speaking opportunities multiply because you're connected to the network that books movemental speakers.

It's not just platform ownership—it's movement infrastructure."

## 🔮 **Josh's Role: The Supporting Infrastructure**

### **What I Bring to This**

"My background is unique for this work. I spent years in neo-monastic movemental leadership, then preaching and young adult ministry, before moving into digital marketing, SEO, and AI integration. I understand both the movemental calling and the technical infrastructure needed to amplify it.

I'm not just building websites—I'm building the digital infrastructure for movements to multiply."

**Technical Excellence:**
- AI integration that actually serves movemental content creation
- SEO optimization that helps your work reach the people who need it
- Platform performance that rivals anything available at any price point
- Continuous improvement based on collective member feedback

**Strategic Guidance:**
- Content strategy that aligns with your calling and amplifies your impact
- Audience development approaches that build genuine community, not just followers
- Revenue optimization that feels authentic to your ministry context
- Collaboration facilitation that creates real value for all participants

**Prophetic Perspective:**
- I help members see connections and opportunities they might miss
- I facilitate introductions and collaborations that advance everyone's work
- I provide strategic reflection on how your platform serves your larger calling
- I help navigate the tension between ministry authenticity and business sustainability

### **The Community I'm Building**

"I'm wiring up the community in creative, non-annoying ways so the amplification is real. This isn't about spam or artificial promotion—it's about genuine connection between people doing aligned work.

When someone in the network publishes something that would genuinely serve another member's audience, I help make that connection. When members are working on similar projects, I facilitate collaboration. When opportunities arise that fit specific members perfectly, I make sure they hear about it.

The goal is network effects that feel organic and valuable, not forced or transactional."

## 🚀 **The Exciting (But Not Bombastic) Truth**

### **What We Can Honestly Say**

**About Impact:**
"We're not promising to make you famous or rich. We're promising to give you the tools and network to amplify the impact you're already called to make. If you're doing work that matters to 10,000 people, we want to help you reach them more effectively and build sustainable economics around your calling."

**About Growth:**
"Most of our early members are seeing significant audience and revenue growth within the first six months. Not because we're doing anything magical, but because we're giving them tools and connections that align with how movements actually multiply."

**About Network Effects:**
"The collaboration happening in our network is unlike anything I've seen in the movemental space. Members are co-authoring projects, cross-promoting each other's work, and sharing opportunities in ways that genuinely advance everyone's impact."

**About the Future:**
"We're building the infrastructure that could change how movements multiply in the digital age. When every movemental leader owns their platform and they're all connected for collaboration, movements spread faster, deeper, and more authentically than anything we've seen before."

### **What We're Not Saying**

- We're not promising overnight success or viral growth
- We're not claiming to have magic marketing formulas
- We're not saying this replaces the hard work of ministry and leadership
- We're not promising that platform ownership alone transforms your impact

### **What We Are Saying**

- Platform ownership aligned with your calling amplifies authentic impact
- Network effects among aligned leaders create unprecedented collaboration opportunities
- AI integration can genuinely serve movemental content creation and audience development
- The economics of shared success create sustainable support for long-term ministry
- When movemental leaders own their platforms, movements multiply more effectively

## 💭 **The Movemental Nature of This Work**

### **Why This Aligns with Movemental Values**

**Incarnational:**
"We're not building generic platforms—we're building platforms that embody each leader's unique calling and context. The technology serves the person and their mission, not the other way around."

**Relational:**
"Everything happens through authentic relationships. No cold outreach, no marketing funnels, no artificial growth hacking. Just movemental leaders recommending tools that genuinely serve other movemental leaders."

**Multiplicational:**
"The goal isn't individual platform success—it's movement multiplication. When every movemental leader has the tools and connections they need to amplify their impact, movements spread more effectively."

**Sustainable:**
"The revenue share model means we're invested in your long-term success, not just upfront payment. We succeed when you succeed, year after year."

### **How This Serves the Broader Movement**

"Every movemental leader who owns their platform instead of renting space on someone else's creates a model for others to follow. Every collaboration that happens through the network demonstrates what's possible when aligned leaders are connected. Every success story proves that movemental leaders can build sustainable economics around their calling.

We're not just building individual platforms—we're pioneering the infrastructure that allows movements to multiply in the digital age."

## 🎯 **The Call to Action**

### **For Current Conversations**

"I think you're exactly the kind of movemental leader this collective is designed for. Your work in [specific area] aligns perfectly with what we're building, and I can see how platform ownership would amplify the impact you're already making.

Would you be interested in a conversation about what this could look like for your specific context and calling?"

### **For Test User Invitations**

"I'm building something I think could be really valuable for movemental leaders like you. Would you be willing to spend some time with [Alan/Brad/existing member]'s new platform and give me feedback on what we're creating? I'd love your perspective on whether this approach to platform ownership serves the movemental community."

### **For Network Referrals**

"Based on our conversation about your platform needs, I think you'd be perfect for the movemental collective we're building. It's invitation-only right now, but I'd love to introduce you to [existing member] who could speak to what we're creating and whether it might serve your calling."

## 📖 **The Meta-Story**

### **What We're Really Doing**

"We're not just building a business—we're creating the infrastructure for movements to multiply in the digital age. When movemental leaders own their platforms, control their audience relationships, and capture the full economic value of their intellectual property, movements spread faster and more authentically.

This is about changing how God's kingdom advances in a digital world."

### **Why It Matters**

"For too long, movemental leaders have been trapped between compromising their message to fit platform algorithms or accepting financial unsustainability for their calling. We're creating a third option: platform ownership that aligns with movemental values and creates sustainable economics around kingdom impact.

When this works, it changes everything."

### **The Vision We're Working Toward**

"Three years from now, when someone thinks about serious movemental leadership, they think about leaders who own their platforms and are connected for collaboration and mutual amplification. The conversation shifts from 'How do I get more followers?' to 'How do I steward the platform and network I've been given to advance movements that matter?'

That's the future we're building toward."

*This is more than a business model—it's a movement infrastructure project disguised as a digital publishing platform.*
