# Movemental.ai Website Directive

This working prompt guides each research-and-writing round. Treat it as a living artifact: every cycle you will (1) read new documentation, (2) update the guidance below, (3) log what you read so the entire corpus is eventually incorporated.

## Working Instructions
1. **Select Docs:** Prioritize documentation that shapes product, platform architecture, narrative, AI philosophy, branding, and audience strategy. Read in generous batches until new insights slow down.
2. **Synthesize:** After each reading round, update every section below—especially the ranked feature list and copy directory—speaking as an expert digital marketing consultant.
3. **Traceability:** Cite which documents informed each insight (inline parentheses, e.g., `(Strategic Narrative)`).
4. **Continuity:** Append to the copy directory instead of overwriting unless guidance has clearly changed; mark revisions as `Updated [date]`.
5. **Research Log:** At the bottom, record every file you fully read so we maintain coverage. Include date + short takeaway.
6. **Iteration Hygiene:** Each new round gets its own dated section (`## Iteration 0X – YYYY-MM-DD`). Edit previous sections if corrections are required, but keep history clear.

### Movemental.ai Website Goals & Required Functions
1. **Narrative Transmission:** Tell the integrated Me/Us/Now story that anchors Alan Hirsch, the Movemental platform, and the convergence moment. The story must feel cinematic, scroll-driven, and media-rich so visitors *experience* the narrative arc instead of reading a brochure (Strategic Narrative).
2. **Scarcity Signaling via Show-Not-Tell:** Demonstrate that Movemental is curated and invitation-only by showcasing select leaders, impeccable craft, and absence of overt application CTAs. Scarcity is communicated through quality and curation, not explicit “limited spots” copy (Strategic Narrative).
3. **Education & Enablement Hub:** Serve as the canonical library for AI, digital publishing, SEO, LMS, and transparency resources so leaders immediately see Movemental as both infrastructure and ongoing coach (Strategic Narrative, AI Values).
4. **Platform Proof:** Visualize the product stack—content OS, AI copilot, network amplification, LMS, assessments, commerce, analytics—to prove Movemental replaces $50K bespoke builds while honoring voice and theology (Strategic Narrative, Branding Guide).
5. **Credibility & Trust Engine:** Address the AI credibility collapse head-on with transparent disclosure systems, scenius storytelling, and theological integrity assurances. The site must feel like the trust layer for AI-era ministry (AI Values).
6. **Network Portal:** Highlight real leaders, cross-links, and scenius moments so prospects see the living network and understand that the path to joining is through relationship with existing members (Strategic Narrative, Audience Definition).

### Core Features & Components (Must-Haves)
- **Hero Experience:** High-contrast, animated hero with headline “Own Your Platform. Amplify Your Impact. Multiply Your Movement.” Pair with cinematic video/visualization showing AI + network data flows (Strategic Narrative, Branding Guide).
- **Three-Part Story Section:** Dedicated interactive storytelling for Alan (“Me”), Movemental (“Us”), and the historical inflection (“Now”), ideally with embedded video, timeline overlays, and pull quotes (Strategic Narrative).
- **Five Whys Value Grid:** Cards or accordion detailing the five selling points (Own Revenue; Network Effects; Voice-Preserving AI; Capture Existing Content; Movement Infrastructure) with data visualizations and proof metrics (Strategic Narrative).
- **Network Showcase:** Curated grid of member platforms with hover states, cross-links, and micro-case studies to illustrate scarcity through excellence (Strategic Narrative, Audience Definition).
- **Platform Capability Theatre:** Modular feature stories covering content OS, AI copilot, LMS, assessments, e-commerce, analytics. Include UI captures, motion demos, and comparison callouts vs. publishers/custom dev (Strategic Narrative, Branding Guide).
- **Credibility Crisis Explainer:** Section diagnosing AI content glut + trust collapse, then presenting scenius and transparency systems as Movemental’s remedy. Use stats, diagrams, and testimonials (Strategic Narrative, AI Values).
- **Transparency & AI Principles Preview:** Highlight badge system, disclosure categories, and AI commitments with CTA to `/ai-principles` & `/transparency` (AI Values).
- **Educational Resource Teaser:** Showcase latest guides/videos (AI, SEO, content, platform ownership) with CTA into `/resources` hub (Strategic Narrative).
- **Invitation Pathway:** Subtle CTA encouraging visitors to connect with network creators rather than apply cold; highlight referral-based onboarding (Strategic Narrative, Audience Definition).
- **Persistent Movemental Badge & Navigation:** Uphold brand system (Direction 2 hybrid) with explicit color/typography choices to meet contrast and premium requirements (Branding Guide).

### Ranked Feature Implementation Plan (with Instructions)
1. **Narrative Hero & Core Storytelling (Highest Impact)**
   - Deliver full-screen hero with animated network mesh (Direction 2) and dual CTAs (`Explore the Network`, `Learn the Story`). Integrate looping excerpt from the 5–7 minute Movemental story film once available. Motion must stay sub-60fps; use Framer Motion + optimized SVG meshes.
   - Immediately follow with the Me/Us/Now scrollytelling. Each chapter should have primary media (Alan video, platform interface reel, convergence timeline). Anchor copy with quotes from the strategic narrative.
2. **Value Proof Stack (“Five Whys”)**
   - Implement responsive card matrix. Each card should surface delta metrics (e.g., “$45K kept vs. $5K publisher share”) and micro-infographics. Add expandable detail for mobile. Include short testimonial or data footnote linking to valuation report when available.
3. **Network Showcase & Scarcity Layer**
   - Build curated carousel/grid with max 12 leaders. Each tile: portrait, 1-line expertise, `Visit Platform` action opening in new tab. Add connective tissue (e.g., subtle lines, amplification metrics) to visualize scenius. Hide generic “Join” CTAs; instead use copy like “Movemental grows through invitation and referral.”
4. **Platform Capability Theatre**
   - Create interactive feature tabs or stacked stories covering: Content OS, AI Copilot, Learning & Assessments, Commerce & Revenue, Analytics & Insights. Each module pairs UI capture, benefit bullets, and “How it replaces $50K custom builds.” Reference brand direction for gradients and iconography. Include microcopy on AI preserving voice + theological integrity.
5. **Credibility Crisis + AI Integrity Section**
   - Dedicate panel to diagnosing AI noise (“40–60% of new content AI-generated”). Contrast with Movemental’s scenius + transparency solution. Visualize transparency badges, theological QA pipeline, and voice preservation workflow. CTA to `/ai-principles`.
6. **Resource & Education Preview**
   - Highlight most recent AI guide, SEO framework, content repurposing playbook. Provide `Access Full Resources` CTA gating into dashboard or resource index. Mention cadence (weekly guides, bi-weekly videos, quarterly releases) to set expectation.
7. **Invitation & Next Steps**
   - Close with relational invitation: “Interested? Start by connecting with a Movemental creator.” Provide curated contact grid or scheduler for discovery conversations. Reiterate referral model and movement ethos.
8. **Global Elements & Utilities**
   - Footer badge linking to Movemental hub, accessibility-compliant nav, dark-mode support with explicit text colors per design rules, and sticky transparency badge explanation accessible from any page.

### Copy & Content Directory (Living List)
- **Hero Headline:** “Own Your Platform. Amplify Your Impact. Multiply Your Movement.” *(Strategic Narrative)*
- **Hero Subhead:** “The first digital publishing ecosystem designed for movement leaders who refuse to rent their influence.” *(Derived from Strategic Narrative + Audience Definition)*
- **Hero CTA Copy:** Primary `Explore the Network`; Secondary `Learn the Story`.
- **Story Pull Quote:** “Same work. Different infrastructure. Exponential results.” *(Strategic Narrative – Five Whys)*
- **Five Whys Microcopy:**  
  1. *Own Your Platform* — “$1,000 to build what publishers charge $50K–$150K for, while keeping 90% of your revenue.”  
  2. *Network Effects* — “28x–500x amplification when your work travels through a curated scenius.”  
  3. *Voice-Preserving AI* — “Agents trained on your theology so AI enhances rather than erases your voice.”  
  4. *Capture What You’re Already Creating* — “Every sermon, session, and insight becomes evergreen, searchable infrastructure.”  
  5. *Movement Infrastructure* — “The digital lattice that historic movements never had.”  
- **Credibility Crisis Hook:** “AI can manufacture infinite voices. Movemental proves which ones are real.” *(AI Values + Strategic Narrative)*
- **Transparency CTA:** “See how we disclose every layer of AI assistance.” linking to `/transparency`.
- **Invitation Copy:** “Movemental grows through referrals inside the network. Talk with a Movemental creator to understand if there’s alignment.” *(Strategic Narrative)*
- **Education Teaser:** “Weekly AI briefs, bi-weekly platform labs, quarterly movement playbooks—built so leaders spend 5 focused hours a week and publish with integrity.” *(AI Values, Strategic Narrative)*
- **Brand Voice Guardrails:** Tone = authoritative + invitational; lexicon uses “movement leaders” on first mention, then introduces “movemental leaders” to define the distinctive framework (Audience Definition).

### Additional Considerations & Opportunities
- **Design System:** Adopt Direction 2 “Network Intelligence” as base, layer in premium polish (Direction 1) and selective community warmth (Direction 3). Ensure explicit text colors per design rules to maintain WCAG contrast.
- **Video Roadmap:** Plan slots for “Movemental Story” film, platform demo, network effects explainer, AI transparency explainer. Reserve hero and /story page hero modules for auto-playing muted clips once produced.
- **Measurement Hooks:** Define KPIs (hero video engagement, Five Whys interaction rate, resource CTA clicks, network card outbound visits) to validate layout effectiveness.
- **Next Research Targets:** Movemental master documentation, platform content audit, GTM playbooks, valuation narrative HTML files for deeper financial storytelling.
