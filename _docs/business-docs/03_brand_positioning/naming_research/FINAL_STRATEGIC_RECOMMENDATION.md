# FINAL STRATEGIC NAMING RECOMMENDATION
*Based on Legal Analysis & Verified Domain Availability*

## ### Why Not MQ?

While MQ has lower legal risk (5-10%), it suffers from:
- **CRITICAL: Only 1 viable domain** (MQLeaders.com - that's it!)
- **MQ.ai is TAKEN** (registered 2017, actively used)
- **Brand building burden** (need to educate market on "MQ" meaning)
- **Generic competition** (competes with countless "MQ" abbreviations)
- **Missed brand equity** (doesn't leverage your existing movemental expertise)ve Summary

After comprehensive legal analysis and systematic domain availability testing, I recommend **MOVEMENTAL** as the strategic choice for your AI-powered digital publishing platform.
