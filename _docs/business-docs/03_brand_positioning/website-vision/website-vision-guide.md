# Movemental.ai Website Vision Report

## Executive Summary
Movemental requires a flagship web experience that operates as the strategic command center for our referral-only ecosystem. The site must choreograph narrative immersion, demonstrate platform rigor, and prove that Movemental curates leaders with the same discipline it applies to technology and governance. This report synthesizes research across brand positioning, deployment governance, valuation, and candidate dossiers to outline the recommended website vision and implementation plan.

## Strategic Outcomes
1. **Narrative Immersion** – Deliver a cinematic hero and *Me / Us / Now* scrollytelling sequence so visitors feel the Movemental story—Alan Hirsch’s leadership, the platform’s intelligence, and the AI-era urgency.
2. **Scarcity Signaling** – Replace public intake forms with referral CTAs, readiness signals, and Movemental Gate references to make the invitation-only model tangible.
3. **Education & Enablement** – Present Movemental as the canonical hub for AI, SEO, LMS, and content repurposing frameworks so leaders can learn before they buy.
4. **Economic Proof** – Explain the $1K + 10% covenant, 90% revenue retention, and network math (16x → 1,000,000x) to satisfy both creators and investors.
5. **Governance Confidence** – Highlight the Movemental Control Plane (Next.js + Supabase MCP, Stripe Connect rev-share, audit trails) to prove responsible stewardship.
6. **Pipeline Transparency** – Publish Movemental Gate pillars, readiness tiers, archetypes, and anonymized dossiers to show disciplined curation across individuals, organizations, and research partnerships.

## Platform Proof & Governance Narrative
1. **Movemental Control Plane** – A single Next.js repository with Supabase MCP, RLS isolation, shared schema, Stripe Connect revenue collection, feature keys, and audit trails ensures every tenant benefits from centralized governance.
2. **Provisioning Workflow** – The `create-tenant` automation launches deployments in weeks by pulling the Alan Hirsch template seed, configuration profile, domain and email setup, Stripe payout, and onboarding training path.
3. **Customization Without Drift** – Session-scoped artwork overrides, theme tokens, and accessibility overlays allow brand expression without violating contrast or typographic rules.
4. **Ownership Covenant** – Leaders own their content, audience, and brand while Movemental operates and upgrades the platform under a $1K upfront + 10% aligned revenue share enforced by Stripe Connect.
5. **Trust Center Hooks** – Uptime, security summaries, AI transparency frameworks, and governance FAQs reinforce the integrity of the 10% partnership.

## Network & Pipeline Narrative
1. **Movemental Gate** – Leaders and organizations are scored against a 100-point rubric spanning mission alignment, content velocity, audience reach, economic readiness, platform mindset, network contribution, and governance fit. Alan Hirsch (Platform Architect) and Brad Brisco (Network Amplifier) archetypes make evaluation criteria visible.
2. **Pipeline Dashboard** – Public dashboards display anonymized counts across readiness tiers (High, Medium, Emerging) and entity types (Individual, Organization, Research). Each segment highlights action tags:
   - **Hero Launches:** Dave Ferguson (Exponential/NewThing) → launch playbook execution.
   - **Organizational Deployments:** Forge America, Wesleyan Multipliers Journey, Forge Canada localization bundle.
   - **Cohort Microsites:** Soul of Movement (Deb Hirsch, Mandy Smith, Bree Mills) plus Bree Mills’ APAC prototypes.
   - **Research Microsites:** Daniel Yang / Send Institute data hub with interactive analytics and AI translation.
   - **Emerging Creators:** Geoff Maddock justice storytelling sprint, Tiffany Smith creative liturgy build.
3. **Referral Flow** – A dedicated CTA invites trusted partners to refer leaders who match the Gate, outlining Engage / Prototype / Nurture pathways and linking to governance expectations.

## Media, Design, and Customization Blueprint
1. **NotebookLM Media Lab** – Demonstrate how a single documentation pack can produce an AI-hosted podcast, visual deck, and clip library within days, reinforcing Movemental’s ability to repurpose intellectual property.
2. **Design System** – Anchor the site in Direction 2 “Network Intelligence” (deep blues, AI violets, network greens) with Direction 1 polish and Direction 3 warmth for community spaces. Every heading and body text must explicitly declare light/dark colors per the Design Rules log.
3. **Interaction Patterns** – Employ animated network meshes, scroll-triggered reveals, hover-responsive cards, and live pipeline stats to keep the experience dynamic without sacrificing clarity.
4. **Customization Guardrails** – Illustrate session artwork overrides, gradient overlays, alt text capture, and slot-based components that enforce contrast standards while enabling leaders to “paint” their session without touching the database.

6. **Measurement & Iteration** – Instrument KPIs (hero dwell, calculator interactions, Gate CTA clicks, resource conversions) and loop performance insights back into the research program.

## Near-Term Research & Content Actions
1. Assemble GTM and launch assets, including `_docs/04_thought_leadership/dave-ferguson-launch-strategy.md` and Exponential media.
2. Draft the valuation “Conclusions” chapter for investor-facing content.
