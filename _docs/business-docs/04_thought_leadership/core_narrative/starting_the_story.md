# Starting the Story: Where to Begin with Movemental
## Strategic Communication Framework for Introducing the Platform

**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Purpose**: Guide for presenting Movemental to potential leaders and stakeholders  
**Approach**: "Show, Don't Tell" with Alan and Brad as proof of concept

## 🎯 **The Core Challenge: Too Much Good News**

### **The Complexity Problem**

We have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to compelling aspects of Movemental:
- Revolutionary pricing model ($1,000 vs. $50K-$150K)
- Network amplification effects (28x-500x improvement)
- AI-powered content creation and optimization
- Brain science-backed transformational learning
- Movemental leader community and credibility
- Revenue sharing alignment (90% vs. 15% retention)
- Technical infrastructure superiority
- Movement multiplication philosophy

**The Risk**: Overwhelming people with too many value propositions leads to confusion and decision paralysis.

**The Solution**: Start with what they can see and experience, then layer in the deeper value.

## 🚀 **The "Show First" Strategy**

### **Phase 1: The Demonstration (Once Alan and Brad Launch)**

**Opening Line**: *"Let me show you something."*

**The Two-Platform Reveal**:
1. **Pull up Alan Hirsch's current website** (alanhirsch.com or 100movements.com)
2. **Pull up Alan's new Movemental platform** (whatever URL we choose)
3. **Let them see the difference immediately**

**What They'll Notice Without You Saying Anything**:
- Professional design vs. dated appearance
- Fast loading vs. slow performance
- Integrated content vs. scattered resources
- Clear navigation vs. confusing structure
- Modern functionality vs. basic features
- Cohesive branding vs. inconsistent messaging

**Then Do the Same with Brad Brisco's Platforms**

### **The Immediate Questions They'll Ask**

**"How much did this cost?"**
- *"$1,000. Plus Alan keeps 90% of everything he makes through it."*
- *"Compare that to what you'd pay elsewhere: $50,000-$150,000, and you'd own it outright but get none of the benefits I'm about to show you."*

**"How long did it take?"**
- *"Four weeks from our first conversation to launch."*
- *"Industry standard is 6-12 months."*

**"What makes it different?"**
- *"Watch what happens when someone searches for [relevant theological term]..."*
- [Show them the SEO results, the network connections, the amplification in real-time]

## 📖 **The Story Arc: Three Acts**

### **Act 1: The Problem They Know (2 minutes)**

**Start Where They Are**:
*"You know the frustration. You've got 20+ years of wisdom, a calling to reach people, and important things to say. But..."*

**The Digital Dilemma**:
- **Option 1**: Stay on platforms that own your audience and take 85% of your revenue
- **Option 2**: Build something custom for $50K-$150K and 6-12 months
- **Option 3**: Use basic tools that make you look amateur and get buried in search results

*"Every movemental leader I know is stuck in this same trap. Until now."*

### **Act 2: The Solution They Can See (5 minutes)**

**The Platform Demonstration**:
*"This is Alan Hirsch's new platform. Here's what happened in his first 90 days..."*

**Show Real Metrics** (once we have them):
- Traffic increase: 8K → 45K monthly visitors
- Email growth: 50 → 600 new subscribers/month
- Search rankings: Invisible → Page 1 for key terms
- Revenue increase: $2K → $12K monthly
- Speaking invitations: 3 → 8 per quarter

**The Network Effect**:
*"But here's the really interesting part. Alan isn't just succeeding alone. Watch this..."*
- Show how his content connects to Brad's content
- Demonstrate the cross-linking and amplification
- Explain the 100-leader vision and network effects

### **Act 3: The Invitation They Can't Refuse (3 minutes)**

**The Scarcity Reality**:
*"We're building toward exactly 100 movemental leaders in the first phase, then expanding to 1,000 total. Ever. The value increases as each new leader joins, but the opportunity won't be available forever."*

**The Investment vs. Return**:
- *"$1,000 to get started, then we succeed when you succeed."*
- *"Alan's platform will pay for itself in the first month. The amplification benefits are permanent."*
- *"Every other option costs 25-50x more and gives you none of the network benefits."*

**The Decision Point**:
*"I'm not asking you to decide today. I'm asking you to imagine what becomes possible when movemental leaders own their platforms, amplify each other's impact, and advance the kingdom together instead of competing for attention on someone else's terms."*

## 🎨 **Customizing the Approach by Audience**

### **For Established Leaders (Alan Hirsch Tier)**

**Lead with Amplification**:
*"You already have influence. This multiplies it by 28x while you keep 90% of everything you make."*

**Show the Network Effect**:
- Demonstrate cross-platform benefits
- Explain the collective intelligence advantage
- Highlight the academic and media credibility boost

**Address the Time Investment**:
*"Four weeks of your time to build something that makes the next 20 years of ministry more effective? And you own it forever."*

### **For Rising Leaders (Emerging Voices)**

**Lead with Credibility**:
*"This isn't just a website. It's association with the network of movemental leaders advancing the kingdom globally."*

**Show the Growth Acceleration**:
- Platform ownership vs. digital sharecropping
- Network amplification for emerging voices
- Path from local impact to global influence

**Address the Investment Concern**:
*"$1,000 is less than most leaders spend on conference travel in a year. This creates a platform that works 24/7 to advance your calling."*

### **For Academic Leaders (Seminary/University)**

*"Your research and teaching deserve a platform that amplifies academic impact while connecting to practitioner application."*

**Show the Citation Benefits**:

**Show the Revenue Potential**:

## 🤝 **Handling Common Objections**

### **"I Don't Have Time for This"**

**Response**: *"That's exactly why this works so well. Alan spends the same amount of time writing he always has. The platform and AI do the amplification work. He's reaching 6x more people with the same time investment."*

### **"I'm Not Technical Enough"**

**Response**: *"Neither is Alan. The dashboard is designed for writers and thinkers, not developers. If you can write an email, you can publish content that reaches thousands of people."*

### **"I Already Have a Website"**

**Response**: *"How many people visited it last month? How much revenue did it generate? How many speaking opportunities did it create? This isn't about replacing what you have—it's about multiplying what's possible."*

### **"I Don't Want to Be Part of a Network"**

**Response**: *"The network amplifies your individual voice, it doesn't diminish it. Alan's content is still distinctly his. The network just ensures more people discover and engage with his unique perspective."*

### **"This Sounds Too Good to Be True"**

**Response**: *"I understand the skepticism. That's why I'm showing you Alan and Brad's actual platforms and real results rather than making promises. The math works because we're solving a real problem with proven technology."*

## 📱 **The Follow-Up Strategy**

### **Immediate Next Steps**

**For Interested Leaders**:

## 🎯 **The Ultimate Opening**

### **When You First Meet a Potential Leader**

**Version 1 (Direct)**:
*"I want to show you something that's going to change how movemental leaders think about digital platforms. It'll take 10 minutes, and then you can decide if you want to know more."*

**Version 2 (Conversational)**:
*"You know how frustrating it is that Alan Hirsch has been shaping movemental theology for 25 years, but if you Google 'incarnational mission,' his work shows up on page 3 behind random blog posts? We fixed that. Want to see how?"*

**Version 3 (Problem-Focused)**:
*"Every movemental leader I know faces the same dilemma: stay trapped on platforms that own your audience, or spend $50K building something custom. We created a third option. Can I show you what Alan Hirsch's platform looks like now?"*

### **The Core Message**

**What We're Really Saying**:
*"Movemental leaders deserve platforms that amplify their kingdom impact rather than extract value from it. We've built the infrastructure that makes this possible. You can see it working right now with leaders you already respect. The question is whether you want to multiply your impact or continue accepting digital limitation."*
