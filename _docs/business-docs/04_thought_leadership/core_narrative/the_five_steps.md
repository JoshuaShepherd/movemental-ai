# The Five Steps: Building Movemental

This is how we build something that matters. Not a platform for its own sake, but infrastructure that serves leaders who are already doing the work of transformation—and helps them do it better.

These five steps represent our path from "concept" to "movement infrastructure." Each step builds on the previous one. Each step has clear success criteria. Each step teaches us something essential about what comes next.

---

## STEP ONE: Build the Foundational Platform (Alan's Platform)

### The Goal

Create a digital publishing platform that genuinely serves the most sophisticated movement thought leaders—not by adding every possible feature, but by doing the essential things exceptionally well.

Alan is our first user, our test case, our proof of concept. If we can't make Alan happy—someone with decades of content, a complex archive, sophisticated needs, and high standards—we can't serve anyone.

### What This Includes

**1. Content Creation and Management**
- Clean, distraction-free writing environment
- Support for articles, blog posts, podcasts, videos, courses, visualizations
- AI-assisted editing that improves clarity without losing voice
- AI tools for repurposing (sermon → article, talk → course outline, etc.)
- Organizational structure that makes sense for how creators actually think
- Version history and drafts that don't get lost

**2. Content Presentation**
- Beautiful, readable article layouts (typography matters)
- Integrated media players (audio/video that actually work)
- Course structures that guide learners without overwhelming them
- Clear navigation that helps visitors discover related content
- Fast load times (no one waits for slow sites anymore)

**3. Archive Integration**
- Digitization and organization of decades of past work
- AI-powered search across everything (not just keyword matching, but semantic search)
- Proper metadata and tagging (so content can be discovered in multiple ways)
- Historical context preserved (when was this written, what was happening then)
- Academic-grade citation support (scholars need to be able to reference this properly)

**4. AI-Augmented User Experience**
- Readers can ask questions of the content ("What does Alan say about gentrification?")
- AI can surface related concepts across the archive
- Guided exploration ("If you liked this, you should read this next")
- Personalized reading paths based on user interests
- But: AI augments, it doesn't replace. The human voice remains primary.

**5. E-Commerce Integration**
- Seamless support for donations, course purchases, consulting bookings
- Secure payment processing (Stripe or equivalent)
- Subscription tiers if desired (but not required—we're not forcing a paywall model)
- Integration with existing systems where they exist
- Clean, non-intrusive presentation (commerce supports the mission, doesn't dominate it)

**6. Analytics and User Management**
- Who's reading what, and how deeply
- Sign-up and subscription management
- Engagement patterns (what resonates, what doesn't)
- Privacy-first approach (we gather what's useful, not everything possible)
- Data that informs strategy, not just vanity metrics

**7. Technical Excellence**
- Mobile-responsive (most reading happens on phones)
- Accessibility compliant (everyone should be able to access this)
- SEO-optimized at the infrastructure level
- Fast, reliable, secure
- Easy to maintain (Alan shouldn't need a tech team)

### How We Execute This

**Phase 1A: Core Publishing (Weeks 1-4)**
- Article creation and publishing
- Basic media upload and display
- Clean, professional theme
- User accounts and basic analytics
- *Success Metric: Alan can write and publish an article that looks great and is easy to share*

**Phase 1B: AI Integration (Weeks 5-8)**
- AI editing assistant
- Content repurposing tools
- AI-augmented search
- Reader interaction features
- *Success Metric: Alan uses AI tools regularly and finds them genuinely helpful*

**Phase 1C: Archive and Commerce (Weeks 9-12)**
- Archive digitization and organization
- Semantic search across all content
- E-commerce integration
- Course/resource structure
- *Success Metric: Alan's entire body of work is accessible, searchable, and monetizable*

**Phase 1D: Refinement (Weeks 13-16)**
- User feedback implementation
- Performance optimization
- Analytics dashboard refinement
- Edge case handling
- *Success Metric: Alan is genuinely happy and uses the platform regularly*

### What NOT to Do

**Don't build features Alan won't use.** If he doesn't need a forum, don't build a forum. If he doesn't want a podcast network, don't build a podcast network. Build what serves his actual needs, not what we think would be cool.

**Don't over-engineer.** Elegant simplicity beats feature bloat. Every feature adds complexity. Every complexity creates maintenance burden. Stay focused.

**Don't copy existing platforms.** We're not building "Substack but better" or "WordPress but for movement leaders." We're building something new. Look at what works elsewhere, learn from it, but don't default to replicating it.

**Don't ignore Alan's feedback.** He's our user. If he says something doesn't work, it doesn't work. Even if we think it should. Especially if we think it should.

**Don't launch publicly until it's actually ready.** One chance to make a first impression with the broader network. Alan's patience is a gift—use it to get this right.

### How We Know We've Succeeded

1. **Alan is genuinely happy.** Not just "this is fine," but "this actually helps me do my work better."

2. **He uses it regularly.** Not just because we built it, but because it's the best tool for what he needs to do.

3. **His audience engages meaningfully.** People read deeply, not just click. They return. They support his work.

4. **His archive is newly accessible.** Things that were buried are now findable. New connections emerge.

5. **We feel confident showing it to others.** When we demo this to Brad Brisco or any other potential user, we're proud of what we've built.

6. **The technology is solid.** No major bugs. Fast. Reliable. Secure. Professional.

7. **We've learned what matters.** We understand what features are essential vs. nice-to-have. We know where to focus for the next user.

---

## STEP TWO: Prove Replicability (Brad Brisco's Platform)

### The Goal

Demonstrate that we can replicate the platform in less than an hour (technologically) and successfully onboard a second user with a different voice, different needs, and different organizational preferences.

This step tests everything:
- Is our architecture actually scalable?
- Can we customize without rebuilding from scratch?
- Does our onboarding process work?
- Can we serve different types of leaders effectively?

### What This Includes

**1. Technical Replication (Target: <1 hour)**
- Spin up new instance of the platform
- Apply Brad's branding/visual preferences
- Configure his organizational structure
- Import any existing content
- Set up his custom domain
- Configure analytics and integrations

**2. Human-Centered Onboarding (Target: 2-3 hours)**
- Deep listening: What does Brad actually need?
- Context understanding: What's his audience, his calling, his current challenges?
- Content strategy: What should he publish first? What cadence makes sense?
- Platform training: But not "here's every feature"—just "here's what matters for you"
- AI orientation: How can AI help his specific work?
- Ongoing support plan: What does he need from us in weeks 2, 4, 8?

### How We Execute This

**Pre-Onboarding (Before We Touch Technology)**
- 1-hour discovery conversation with Brad
- Understand his existing content, audience, goals
- Identify his top 3-5 use cases for the platform
- Determine what success looks like for him specifically
- *Success Metric: We can articulate Brad's needs in his own words*

**Technical Setup (1-hour sprint)**
- Deploy platform instance
- Configure branding and structure
- Test all core functionality
- Prepare welcome/orientation materials
- *Success Metric: Platform is live and functional in <1 hour*

**Onboarding Session (2-3 hours, can be split across days)**
- Platform walkthrough focused on his use cases
- First content creation (we sit with him, help him publish something)
- AI tools demonstration with his actual content
- Q&A and troubleshooting
- Set expectations for ongoing support
- *Success Metric: Brad publishes his first piece during or immediately after onboarding*

**Week 1 Support (Intensive)**
- Daily check-ins (brief, just "how's it going?")
- Immediate response to any issues
- Help with second and third pieces of content
- Refine his content strategy based on early feedback
- *Success Metric: Brad publishes 2-3 more pieces in first week*

**Week 2-4 Support (Moderate)**
- Twice-weekly check-ins
- Content strategy coaching
- Analytics review and interpretation
- Feature adoption (helping him use tools he hasn't tried yet)
- *Success Metric: Brad has established a sustainable publishing rhythm*

**Month 2-3 Support (Light but Consistent)**
- Weekly check-ins
- Ongoing strategy conversations
- Platform updates and new features
- Community connection (introduce him to Alan, other users)
- *Success Metric: Brad is self-sufficient but knows we're here*

### What NOT to Do

**Don't assume Brad wants what Alan wanted.** Different leaders, different contexts, different needs. Listen before prescribing.

**Don't make onboarding about the technology.** Focus on "what do you want to say and to whom?" not "here's how to use the CMS." Technology serves the mission, not the other way around.

**Don't rush the replication.** Yes, we want to prove we can do it fast. But not so fast we break things or cut corners. The 1-hour target is aspirational—if it takes 90 minutes and it's rock solid, that's fine.

**Don't abandon Brad after onboarding.** The platform only matters if he actually uses it. Early support is crucial. Be present.

**Don't copy Alan's structure wholesale.** Brad's organization should reflect Brad's thinking, not Alan's. Customize meaningfully.

### How We Know We've Succeeded

1. **Technical replication happens in <1 hour.** This proves our architecture is sound and repeatable.

2. **Brad's platform looks and feels like his own.** Not "generic template #2," but something that reflects his voice and brand.

3. **Brad publishes regularly in the first month.** At least weekly. Ideally more.

4. **Brad feels supported, not overwhelmed.** Onboarding was helpful, not a firehose.

5. **Brad refers someone else.** The ultimate validation: "You should check this out."

6. **We've documented the replication process.** Everything we did is written down so we can repeat it with user #3.

7. **We've identified what's customizable vs. standard.** We know what must be the same across all platforms and what can flex.

8. **We've refined our onboarding playbook.** What worked with Alan but not Brad? What new things did Brad need that Alan didn't?

---

## STEP THREE: Build the Ecosystem (Movemental.ai, JoshShepherd.ai)

### The Goal

Create the meta-layer: platforms that teach, guide, and contextualize what we're building. This step establishes Movemental as not just a service provider but a thought leader in the space of digital publishing for movement leaders.

This is also where we start building the scenius infrastructure—not just individual platforms, but an interconnected network.

### What This Includes

**1. Movemental.ai (The Teaching Hub)**

Primary content types:
- **Best practices in digital publishing for movement leaders**
  - How to establish a content cadence
  - What to write about when you "don't know what to write"
  - Repurposing sermons, talks, and conversations
  - Writing for discovery (SEO without selling out)
  - Building a body of work over time, not just isolated posts

- **SEO that serves mission, not algorithms**
  - How search works in 2025
  - Why movement leaders need to be findable
  - Technical basics without technical overwhelm
  - Content strategies that work organically
  - Measuring what matters

- **AI as tool, not replacement**
  - How to use AI for editing and amplification
  - How to maintain your voice while using AI assistance
  - Ethical considerations for Christian leaders using AI
  - What AI can and can't do well
  - Future-proofing your platform in an AI world

- **Movement principles for digital spaces**
  - Relational, embodied, Jesus-shaped even online
  - Community vs. audience
  - Credibility in the age of AI
  - Why scenius matters
  - Avoiding the consumeristic church growth model digitally

Format:
- Long-form articles (depth, not hot takes)
- Video tutorials (screen recordings for technical stuff)
- Downloadable resources (templates, checklists, guides)
- Organized in user dashboards (easily accessible when they need it)

**2. JoshShepherd.ai (The Theological/Ethical Voice)**

Primary content types:
- **The ethical implications of AI for faith communities**
  - What AI means for truth-telling
  - Credibility and authenticity in digital spaces
  - Power dynamics in algorithmic systems
  - The theology of human creativity vs. machine generation

- **A prophetic response to technological change**
  - Not reactionary ("AI is evil")
  - Not utopian ("AI will save us")
  - But movemental: "How do we engage this faithfully?"

- **Scenius as Christian practice**
  - Mutual elevation vs. competition
  - Community as credibility infrastructure
  - Why the church should have invented this model

- **The intersection of digital publishing and discipleship**
  - How writing clarifies thinking
  - How teaching online extends pastoral presence
  - How movements spread through ideas

Format:
- Essays and long-form reflection
- Occasional podcasts/videos
- More contemplative, less tutorial
- This is thought leadership, not instruction

**3. Cross-Platform Integration**

The magic happens in the connections:
- Articles on movemental.ai reference specific user platforms
- Josh's theological pieces cite Alan's work, Brad's work
- Alan and Brad (and future users) build on each other's ideas
- Search across all platforms surfaces related content
- Network effect becomes visible and measurable

### How We Execute This

**Month 1-2: Foundation Content**
- Create core library for movemental.ai:
  - 10-15 foundational articles on digital publishing
  - 5-8 video tutorials on platform basics
  - SEO guide specifically for movement leaders
  - AI usage guidelines
- Launch joshshepherd.ai with 5-8 initial essays
- Ensure all content is well-organized and accessible
- *Success Metric: When we onboard user #3, educational resources are ready*

**Month 3-4: Integration**
- Implement cross-platform search
- Create content linking structures
- Build discovery mechanisms (related content, recommendations)
- Begin writing that explicitly connects across platforms
- *Success Metric: Users can easily find related content across the network*

**Month 5-6: Community Development**
- Introduce users to each other (Alan meets Brad, etc.)
- Facilitate cross-referencing and collaboration
- Create opportunities for users to engage each other's work
- Document and share emerging patterns
- *Success Metric: Users are organically referencing each other*

**Ongoing: Content Cadence**
- Movemental.ai: Weekly article + monthly video
- JoshShepherd.ai: Bi-weekly essay (quality over quantity)
- Both platforms: Responsive to user needs and questions
- All content: Archived, searchable, building over time
- *Success Metric: Educational content library grows consistently*

### What NOT to Do

**Don't make movemental.ai just marketing.** It needs to genuinely serve users, not just sell the platform. If the best advice is sometimes "don't use a platform like ours," say that.

**Don't make joshshepherd.ai preachy.** Theological reflection, not sermons. Questions, not answers. Invitation to think, not instruction to comply.

**Don't create content for its own sake.** Every piece should serve a real need or explore a genuine question. No filler.

**Don't silo the platforms.** The whole point is network. If these feel like separate, isolated sites, we've failed.

**Don't neglect the teaching content.** It's easy to focus on building features and ignore documentation. But users need guidance. Prioritize it.

### How We Know We've Succeeded

1. **Users actually use the educational resources.** Analytics show people reading, watching, downloading.

2. **Users report feeling equipped, not overwhelmed.** "This helps me understand what to do" not "this is too much."

3. **The network is starting to emerge.** Cross-references appear organically. Users discover each other.

4. **Search works across platforms.** I can find relevant content regardless of where it was published.

5. **The educational content is itself well-optimized.** People find movemental.ai through search when looking for help with digital publishing.

6. **Josh's platform establishes credibility.** When we say "we understand the ethical implications," there's substance behind it.

7. **We're eating our own dog food.** These platforms run on our infrastructure and prove it works.

---

## STEP FOUR: Scale Deliberately (Sustainable Onboarding)

### The Goal

Grow the network at the pace of our actual capacity to support users well. Not "how many accounts can we create?" but "how many leaders can we actually help establish sustainable content practices?"

This is where we learn whether we have a business model or just a cool project.

### The Fundamental Principle

**We only onboard new users when we can ensure their success.**

Success = establishing a content creation cadence that fits their calling and audience, not just having an account.

This means our bottleneck is deliberately *not* technology. It's human attention: coaching, listening, guiding, supporting.

### What This Includes

**1. Pre-Onboarding Assessment**

Before anyone becomes a user, we need to understand:
- **Their existing audience and platform**
  - Do they have a newsletter? How many subscribers?
  - Active on social media? Which platforms?
  - Existing website? What's working, what's not?
  - Previous publishing experience?

- **Their content potential**
  - Do they preach/speak regularly?
  - Have they written books, articles, etc.?
  - What's their unique expertise/perspective?
  - What archive exists that could be repurposed?

- **Their calling and goals**
  - What are they trying to accomplish?
  - Who are they trying to reach?
  - What would success look like for them?
  - What's their current capacity for content creation?

- **Their readiness**
  - Can they commit to at least monthly publishing?
  - Do they have bandwidth for onboarding?
  - Are they willing to be coached?
  - Do they understand this is a long game, not quick wins?

*Red flags that mean "not yet":*
- No existing audience (they need to build that first)
- No content creation capacity (too busy with other priorities)
- Expecting magic ("I'll just set up a site and people will find me")
- Not willing to learn or be coached
- Misaligned values (just wanting a platform, not interested in movement)

**2. Personalized Onboarding Strategy**

Based on the assessment, create a custom plan:
- **Content strategy**: What should they publish first?
- **Publishing cadence**: Weekly? Bi-weekly? Monthly?
- **Quick wins**: What can they repurpose immediately?
- **Long-term vision**: What does their platform look like in a year?
- **Support needs**: How much coaching do they need?

**3. Phased Onboarding**

Don't dump everything on them at once.

**Week 1: Core Publishing**
- Get platform live
- Publish first piece
- Understand basic workflow
- *Goal: One published article they're proud of*

**Week 2-3: Building Rhythm**
- Publish 2-3 more pieces
- Refine their content strategy
- Start using AI tools
- *Goal: Confidence in the basic process*

**Week 4-6: Expanding Capability**
- Add media (podcasts, videos) if relevant
- Repurpose archive content
- Integrate e-commerce if desired
- Optimize for search
- *Goal: Using the platform's full capabilities*

**Week 7-12: Establishing Cadence**
- Weekly check-ins decrease to bi-weekly
- Focus on sustainability: "Can you keep this up?"
- Refine based on early analytics
- Connect with other users in the network
- *Goal: Sustainable content practice without constant hand-holding*

**4. User-Specific Insights**

As we work with each user, we gather and document:
- **What works for their audience**: Topics, formats, lengths
- **Their voice and strengths**: What they're uniquely good at
- **Their constraints**: Time, energy, other responsibilities
- **Emerging patterns**: Themes that resonate
- **Network connections**: Who should they know, who should know them?

This isn't just data collection—it's ongoing strategy refinement.

**5. Iterative Learning**

Every new user teaches us something:
- What's working in onboarding?
- What's confusing?
- What features matter most?
- What support do people really need?
- What differentiates successful users from struggling ones?

We document everything. Our onboarding process should get better with every cohort.

### How We Execute This

**Cohort Model**

Instead of random ongoing onboarding, we work in cohorts:
- **Cohort 1**: Alan, Brad (users 1-2) - Months 1-4
- **Cohort 2**: 3-5 users - Months 5-7
- **Cohort 3**: 5-8 users - Months 8-10
- **Cohort 4**: 8-12 users - Months 11-13
- And so on, scaling capacity deliberately

Benefits:
- Users onboard together, can support each other
- We can do group training sessions when relevant
- Concentrated effort, then breathing room to assess
- Clear growth trajectory without overwhelming ourselves

**Application Process**

We can't just say "yes" to everyone who's interested.

Simple application:
1. Who are you and what do you do?
2. What's your existing platform/audience?
3. Why do you want to join Movemental?
4. What do you hope to accomplish?
5. What's your capacity for content creation?
6. How did you hear about us?

This gives us what we need to assess fit and readiness.

**Tiered Support Model**

Not everyone needs the same level of support.

**Tier 1 (High Touch)**: First-time digital publishers, large archives to migrate, high complexity
- Weekly 1-on-1 calls for first 12 weeks
- Custom content strategy
- Higher onboarding fee reflects higher support

**Tier 2 (Standard)**: Some digital experience, moderate complexity
- Bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls for first 8 weeks
- Semi-custom content strategy based on templates
- Standard onboarding fee

**Tier 3 (Light Touch)**: Experienced digital publishers, just need better infrastructure
- Monthly 1-on-1 calls for first 3 months
- Self-guided onboarding with documentation
- Lower onboarding fee

Everyone gets access to educational resources, network benefits, and ongoing technical support. The difference is intensity of personal coaching.

**Scaling Support Capacity**

As we grow, we'll need to hire.

First hire (around user 10-15): **Onboarding Specialist**
- Manages the application/assessment process
- Conducts initial discovery conversations
- Leads technical platform setup
- Coordinates with Josh for strategy conversations
- Documents everything for iterative improvement

Second hire (around user 20-30): **Content Strategist/Coach**
- Develops content strategies for new users
- Conducts coaching calls
- Reviews user content and offers feedback
- Creates educational resources based on common needs
- Facilitates cross-user connections

These roles are *not* customer service reps or tech support. They're coaches and strategists who help leaders become effective digital publishers.

### What NOT to Do

**Don't prioritize growth over user success.** If we can support 20 users well or 50 users poorly, we support 20. Quality compounds. Mediocrity dies.

**Don't accept users who aren't ready.** It's not mean to say "not yet"—it's honest. Better to have fewer successful users than many struggling ones.

**Don't standardize too much.** Yes, we need efficient processes. But every user is unique. The sweet spot is structured flexibility: frameworks that adapt.

**Don't stop learning.** Every user teaches us something. Document it. Adjust. Improve.

**Don't ignore the data.** What's working? What's not? Let analytics and user feedback shape our approach.

**Don't lose the human touch.** As we scale, the temptation is to automate everything. Resist. The coaching is the value. The relationship is the product.

### How We Know We've Succeeded

**User-Level Success Metrics:**

1. **Publishing consistency**: 80%+ of users publish at least monthly
2. **Content quality**: Users (and we) are proud of what's being published
3. **Audience growth**: Users see increasing readership over first 6 months
4. **Platform utilization**: Users are actually using the tools, not just having accounts
5. **User satisfaction**: NPS score of 50+ (would they recommend us?)
6. **Revenue sustainability**: Users see value worth paying for

**Network-Level Success Metrics:**

1. **Cross-referencing**: Users are citing each other's work
2. **Discovery**: Users report finding other network members organically
3. **Collective reach**: Network-wide readership growing month-over-month
4. **SEO performance**: Network content ranking well across diverse topics
5. **Credibility emergence**: External recognition of the network as a source of quality thought leadership

**Business-Level Success Metrics:**

1. **Onboarding efficiency**: Time from application to first published piece decreasing
2. **Support scalability**: Support hours per user decreasing as processes improve
3. **Retention**: 90%+ of users still active after 6 months
4. **Referrals**: 50%+ of new users come from existing user referrals
5. **Financial sustainability**: Revenue covers costs by user 15-20
6. **Team capacity**: We can hire before we're overwhelmed

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

- Users churning before establishing content rhythm
- Support team constantly overwhelmed
- Quality declining as we scale
- Users not engaging with network, just using as isolated platform
- Revenue not scaling with user growth
- We're saying "yes" to users who aren't good fits just to hit numbers

## STEP FIVE: Measure What Matters (Movemental Impact)

### The Goal

Ensure that we're actually contributing to movemental transformation—not just creating another content platform that replicates the consumeristic church growth model in a digital landscape.

This is the hardest step. It's also the most important.

Because if we succeed at Steps 1-4 but fail at Step 5, we've just built another tool for celebrity pastors to build bigger platforms. That's not the mission.

### The Core Commitment

We hold ourselves accountable to the truth that movement is always:
1. **Relational** - Not broadcast, but connection
2. **Embodied** - Not just online, but in actual communities
3. **Jesus-shaped** - Cruciform, self-giving, transformative

This means we must measure not just engagement, but *embodied change in actual Christian communities*.

### What This Includes

**1. Standard Digital Metrics (Necessary but Insufficient)**

We track these because they matter, but they're not the whole story:
- Page views and unique visitors
- Time on page and depth of engagement
- Newsletter subscriptions and open rates
- Content shares and backlinks
- SEO rankings and organic traffic
- Revenue and support patterns

These tell us: "Is the platform working technically? Are people finding and reading the content?"

But they don't tell us: "Is this content leading to actual transformation?"

**2. Relational Metrics (Getting Closer)**

We need to measure *relationships*, not just audience:
- **Repeat readership**: Are the same people returning? (Suggests relationship, not just casual discovery)
- **Commenting and substantive engagement**: Are people asking questions, sharing their own stories? (Suggests dialog, not just consumption)
- **Direct communication**: Are readers emailing authors, requesting conversations? (Suggests relationship formation)
- **Cross-platform engagement**: Are readers following multiple network authors? (Suggests investment in the network, not just individuals)
- **In-person connections**: Are online relationships leading to offline meetings, collaborations? (Suggests embodiment)

**3. Embodiment Metrics (The Hard Part)**

How do we measure whether online content is leading to offline transformation?

**Surveys and Stories**

Every quarter, we ask readers:
- How has the content you've read here influenced your actual daily life?
- Have you changed any practices because of what you've learned?
- Have you had conversations with others in your community about these ideas?
- Have you taken any actions (in your church, neighborhood, work) informed by this content?
- Can you tell us a specific story of how this content mattered?

We're looking for:
- Changed practices ("I started meeting with my neighbors")
- Initiated conversations ("I talked with my small group about...")
- Organizational shifts ("Our church began to...")
- Individual transformation ("I'm now...")

**Case Studies**

Regularly (monthly), we document specific stories:
- A reader who applied ideas from Brad's content in their church context
- A pastor who changed their preaching approach after engaging Alan's work
- A nonprofit that shifted strategy after reading network content
- A community that was formed because of connections made through the platform

These are narrative, not quantitative. But they're evidence.

**Leader Accountability**

Our authors must be able to articulate:
- Who from their online audience have they met in person?
- What offline communities are engaging their online content?
- What embodied practices are they teaching/modeling?
- How are they connecting online readers to local communities?

If an author has 10,000 readers but zero actual relationships with them, something's wrong.
If an author is publishing online but not involved in face-to-face community themselves, something's wrong.

We're not measuring to shame. We're measuring to ensure alignment.

**4. Jesus-Shaped Metrics (The Deepest Part)**

How do we measure whether this is leading to Christlikeness?

This is almost impossible to measure directly. But we can look for indicators:

**In Content:**
- Is the content invitational, not coercive?
- Does it embody cruciform values (self-giving, not self-promoting)?
- Does it challenge consumerism or reinforce it?
- Does it point toward Jesus or toward the author?
- Does it build up the church or just the author's platform?

**In Community:**
- Are network authors mutually elevating or competing?
- Is success defined by collective impact or individual metrics?
- Are conflicts handled with grace and repentance?
- Is there accountability and truth-telling?
- Do relationships reflect kingdom values?

**In Reader Impact:**
- Are readers becoming more self-giving in their communities?
- Are readers' stories reflecting growth in love, justice, service?
- Are readers connecting faith and daily life?
- Are readers' lives pointing toward Jesus?

These are qualitative, not quantitative. We gather this through:
- Stories readers share
- Observations of community dynamics
- Regular reflection with authors
- Third-party perspectives (what do outside observers see?)

### How We Execute This

**Quarterly Impact Reviews**

Every three months:
1. Gather all metrics (digital, relational, embodiment, qualitative)
2. Review with leadership team
3. Ask: Are we seeing evidence of actual movemental impact?
4. Identify areas of concern or celebration
5. Adjust strategy based on what we learn

**Public Storytelling**

We tell the stories of impact:
- Movemental.ai publishes quarterly impact reports
- These are honest, not promotional
- We share successes *and* areas where we're falling short
- We invite accountability from our users and readers

This transparency is itself countercultural. Most platforms hide their metrics or only share vanity numbers. We tell the truth.

**User Accountability Conversations**

Annually, we have a dedicated conversation with each author:
- How do you see your online work connecting to embodied community?
- Who from your online audience have you met face-to-face this year?
- What stories of transformation can you share?
- Where do you see gaps between digital presence and embodied impact?
- How can we help you bridge those gaps?

This isn't punitive. It's formational. We're all trying to do this faithfully.

**Ongoing Research**

Partner with academics or researchers to study:
- How does online content influence offline behavior in faith communities?
- What's the relationship between digital thought leadership and embodied movement?
- How does the scenius model impact both readers and authors?
- What makes some content transformative vs. merely engaging?

This research doesn't just help us—it contributes to the broader conversation about digital discipleship.

### What NOT to Do

**Don't default to vanity metrics.** Page views are easy to measure. Transformation is hard. Do the hard work.

**Don't create measurement burden.** We want authors focused on writing, not filling out surveys. Keep measurement processes streamlined.

**Don't manipulate data to tell a good story.** If we're not seeing movemental impact, we say that honestly. The point is learning, not looking good.

**Don't measure without action.** If metrics reveal problems, we address them. Measurement without response is useless.

**Don't lose sight of the mission.** All the engagement in the world doesn't matter if people aren't being transformed. Stay focused on what actually matters.

### How We Know We've Succeeded

**After Year 1:**

1. We have systems in place to measure relational and embodiment metrics, not just digital ones
2. We've collected at least 50 specific stories of embodied impact from readers
3. Our authors can articulate how their online work connects to offline community
4. We've published at least two honest impact reports that show both successes and challenges
5. External observers (peers, researchers) affirm that we're measuring what matters

**After Year 2:**

1. We have longitudinal data showing patterns of impact over time
2. We can demonstrate that our network is producing actual movemental transformation, not just content consumption
3. Authors are actively connecting online readers to offline communities
4. The network itself embodies scenius values (mutual elevation, collaborative genius)
5. We're influencing how others think about measuring digital ministry impact

**After Year 3:**

1. We've contributed to broader research on digital discipleship and embodied movement
2. Our measurement approaches are being adopted by other organizations
3. We have clear evidence that our model differs meaningfully from consumeristic approaches
4. The network is recognized not just for content quality but for actual kingdom impact
5. We've stayed true to the commitment: relational, embodied, Jesus-shaped

**Red Flags:**

- Authors becoming celebrity personalities disconnected from communities
- Readers consuming content but not changing practices
- Network growth without corresponding embodied impact
- Measurement systems becoming bureaucratic burden
- We stop asking hard questions because answers are uncomfortable

## The Through-Line: Why These Five Steps Matter

These steps represent a progression from **infrastructure** to **impact**.

**Step 1** proves we can build excellent tools.
**Step 2** proves those tools can scale.
**Step 3** proves we can build a network, not just isolated platforms.
**Step 4** proves we can grow sustainably while maintaining quality.
**Step 5** proves we're actually accomplishing the mission.

If we do Steps 1-4 well but fail at Step 5, we've built a business but missed the calling.

If we obsess about Step 5 but fail at Steps 1-4, we have beautiful values but no sustainable way to live them out.

We need all five.

## Success Indicators by Timeline

**After 6 Months:**
- Alan's platform is excellent and he's using it regularly
- Brad's platform is live and he's publishing consistently
- Movemental.ai and JoshShepherd.ai have substantive content
- We have a documented onboarding process
- We're measuring digital metrics and gathering first stories of impact

**After 12 Months:**
- 10-15 total users, all publishing at least monthly
- Visible network effects (cross-referencing, discovery)
- Cohort 3 onboarding
- Revenue approaching sustainability
- First annual impact report published
- Clear evidence of embodied transformation from multiple readers

**After 18 Months:**
- 20-30 total users across diverse movement contexts
- Network recognized externally as credible thought leadership ecosystem
- One full-time hire supporting onboarding/coaching
- Revenue sustainable
- Longitudinal impact data showing patterns
- Research partnership exploring digital discipleship

**After 24 Months:**
- 40-60 total users
- Network generates 2-3M annual page views
- SEO dominance in movement/missional content space
- 2-3 full-time team members
- Proven model that others want to replicate
- Measurable movemental impact across multiple communities
- Clear differentiation from consumeristic church growth models

## The Commitment

We will not:
- Chase growth for its own sake
- Sacrifice quality for scale
- Prioritize metrics over mission
- Build tools that undermine embodied community
- Replicate the problems we're trying to solve

We will:
- Move at the pace of actual capacity
- Measure what actually matters
- Tell the truth about what we're seeing
- Stay accountable to movemental values
- Prioritize transformation over engagement
- Build infrastructure that serves the kingdom, not just content creators

This is hard work. It won't scale as fast as investor-funded platforms. It won't have the viral growth of consumer products.

But it will be faithful. And sustainable. And genuinely useful for leaders who are trying to serve Jesus and build movements that transform communities.

That's worth building slowly and carefully.
