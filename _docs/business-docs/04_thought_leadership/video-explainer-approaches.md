## Script Development Framework

### Core Narrative Structure

**Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)**
"What if movement leaders could own their digital platforms for the cost of a used car instead of a house? What if they could keep 90% of their revenue instead of 15%? Movemental makes this possible."

**Problem Statement (0:30-1:30)**
"Right now, movement leaders face an impossible choice: rent space on platforms that own their audience and capture 85% of their value, or pay $50,000-$150,000 for platform ownership that takes 6-12 months to build. Most leaders can't afford either option."

**Solution Introduction (1:30-2:30)**
"Movemental changes everything. For $1,000 plus 10% of what you earn, movement leaders get complete platform ownership in 2-4 weeks. You own your content, your audience, and 90% of your revenue. We only succeed when you succeed."

**Network Effects (2:30-3:30)**
"But here's what makes Movemental revolutionary: network effects. Your content doesn't just reach your audience—it reaches the audiences of every other movemental leader in the network. At 100 users, that's 28x amplification. At 1,000 users, that's 500x. Same work. Different infrastructure."

**AI Integration (3:30-4:00)**
"Movemental's AI doesn't replace your voice—it preserves it. Specialized agents learn your theological positions, your communication style, and your movement focus. One sermon becomes 12 content pieces in 90 minutes, all maintaining your authentic voice."

**Call to Action (4:00-4:30)**
"Movemental is invitation-only, building a curated network of movemental leaders who are pioneering platform ownership. If you're catalyzing movements, multiplying impact, and ready to own your digital presence, we'd love to have a conversation."
