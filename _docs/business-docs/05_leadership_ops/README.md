## Scope
Everything related to leader evaluation, onboarding, operational processes, and strategic governance. Combines the former leader management and operations folders along with AI values and strategic narrative artifacts.

## Key Artifacts
- `leader_management/` – evaluation rubric, prospecting databases, onboarding protocols, profiles.
- `operations/` – legal docs, processes, partnerships.
- Executive narratives: `strategic-narrative.md`, `movemental-ai-values-and-beliefs.md` (PDF exports archived).

## Maintenance
- Update evaluation rubrics and prospect databases whenever new leaders enter pipeline.
- Keep ops processes synchronized with actual workflows and legal agreements.
- Capture governance decisions in `_docs/00_foundation/changelog.md` and notify leadership.
