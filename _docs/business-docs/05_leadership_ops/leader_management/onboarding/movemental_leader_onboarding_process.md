# Movemental Leader Onboarding Process
> **Complete intake system for custom platform builds**

## Process Overview

The Movemental onboarding process transforms a movemental leader from initial inquiry to platform launch in **3-4 weeks**. This comprehensive system ensures we build not just a website, but a strategic digital presence that amplifies their voice, grows their audience, and generates sustainable revenue while maintaining movemental integrity.

### Process Philosophy
- **Movement-first**: We understand the leader's calling and movement context before building tools
- **Evidence-based**: We research existing content and audience patterns
- **Prototype-driven**: We show, don't just tell
- **Launch-ready**: Every platform launches with content, not empty templates
- **Network-integrated**: Connections to other movemental leaders from day one
