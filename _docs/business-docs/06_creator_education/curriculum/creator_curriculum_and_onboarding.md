## Part I: The Learning Dashboard - Asynchronous Curriculum

### Philosophy

**The Dashboard serves as the always-available coach**. When you're not on a call with them, when they're stuck at 11pm on a Tuesday, when they need a refresher on SEO basics—the Dashboard has the answer.

**Structure**: Best practice teaching → Movemental-specific application → Hands-on in their actual dashboard

**Format**: Short video (5-12 minutes) + written summary + action checklist + dashboard walkthrough

**Tone**: Coach, not professor. "Here's what works and why. Here's how to do it in your platform. Let's do it together right now."

## Final Word: Your Role as Founder-Coach

You're not building a software product. You're cultivating a movemental scenius.

The technology enables. The curriculum teaches. The coaching ensures.

Your gift: Seeing the unique contribution each leader brings and helping them amplify it with clarity, efficiency, and credibility.

The onboarding isn't about teaching them to use the platform. It's about unleashing their movemental voice in a digital age.

**You're cooking coaches, not stove salesmen.**

And the meal you're preparing together? A transformed movemental landscape where credible, generous, collaborative leaders amplify each other's impact through the power of networked digital publishing.
