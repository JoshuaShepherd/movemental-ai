- `leader_configs/` – voice and style packs per leader.
- `workflows/` – end-to-end content systems, QA, automation.
- Archive utilities: `archive-image-prompts.md`, `archive-image-requirements.md`.
- **Archive workflow**: See `_docs/design-game/01-process/deploy-to-archive-workflow.md` for archive deployment process.

## Maintenance
- Update after any major agent capability change or new leader configuration.
- Ensure prompts stay aligned with contrast/design rules from `_docs/08_integrated_design/`.
- Note systemic updates in `_docs/00_foundation/changelog.md` for visibility.
