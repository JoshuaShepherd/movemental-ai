# Contextual Image Requirements for Archive Assets

To ensure every archived design tells a complete story—not just who led the work but *what* was produced and how it lives in context—each archive entry should include or request the following image types in addition to headshots.

## 1. Book & Publication Assets
- Full front cover renders (flat + angled mockups) for each book or guide
- Interior spread mockups that show typographic hierarchy and annotations
- Detail crops of footnotes, marginalia, or data callouts to highlight craftsmanship
- Stack or collection photos demonstrating how multiple volumes relate visually

## 2. Interface & Product Context
- Full-page UI captures for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
- Interaction sequence frames (before → hover → after) for critical flows
- Dashboard or system overview composites showing cross-feature relationships
- Error/empty-state illustrations to prove resilience and completeness

## 3. Process & Workshop Evidence
- Whiteboard or wall capture of workshop boards showing raw thinking
- Post-it clustering or affinity diagram close-ups to convey decision paths
- Time-lapse strips of process artifacts evolving from sketch to fidelity
- Agenda or facilitation boards to document session structure

## 4. Physical & Environmental Storytelling
- Workspace or studio environment shots to ground the aesthetic context
- Material studies (paper samples, fabric swatches, finish tests) for tactile work
- Installation or exhibit photographs showing scale and visitor interaction
- Packaging or unboxing sequences when delivering physical kits

## 5. Prototype & System Evolution
- Low-fi sketch sheets alongside high-fi comps to illustrate evolution
- Component libraries or design system boards with token callouts
- Motion storyboard frames or keyframe exports for animated moments
- Comparative overlays (v1 vs v2) that articulate iteration decisions

## 6. Research & Evidence Artifacts
- Field photography (participants, environments) with consent clearance
- Transcript excerpts or annotated research boards visualized for clarity
- Insight cards or opportunity maps pinned up for synthesis storytelling
- Survey or data viz screenshots proving quantitative rigor

## 7. Launch & Adoption Signals
- Social/email announcement graphics in situ (e.g., inbox, timeline mockups)
- PR or press kit visuals demonstrating external validation
- Event photography (talks, workshops, demos) with branded stage backdrop
- Analytics or KPI dashboard captures that show post-launch performance

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Confirm every section above has at least one high-resolution asset
- [ ] Provide layered source files or smart objects for templates when possible
- [ ] Verify contrast, color accuracy, and legibility in both light/dark contexts
- [ ] Name files descriptively (e.g., `book-spread-chapter-03.webp`)
- [ ] Store assets in `/app/public` subfolders that mirror archive IDs for reuse

Capturing these contextual visuals ensures archived templates feel like living case studies rather than static portraits, preserving the narrative, craft, and proof behind each design.
