## Terminology Analysis

### What We Call Them

#### Primary Term: "Movemental Leaders"

**Usage in Documentation**: This is the most frequently used term across all strategic documents. It appears in:
- Business plan and strategy documents
- Value proposition statements
- Marketing materials
- Platform descriptions

**Definition**: Leaders who catalyze movements through systematic, network-based approaches to transformation. The term "movemental" (as opposed to just "movement") emphasizes the systematic, reproducible, infrastructure-focused approach to movement building.

**Strengths**:
- Distinguishes from generic "leaders" or "influencers"
- Emphasizes systematic, reproducible approach
- Aligns with Alan Hirsch's "movemental theology" framework
- Creates category definition and thought leadership positioning

**Weaknesses**:
- May be unfamiliar to the audience initially
- Requires explanation ("movemental" vs. "movement")
- Could feel like jargon or insider language
- Less immediately understandable to external stakeholders

#### Secondary Term: "Movement Leaders"

**Usage**: Used interchangeably with "movemental leaders" in many contexts, especially in external-facing materials.

**Definition**: Leaders who catalyze and multiply movements. Simpler, more immediately understandable.

**Strengths**:
- Immediately clear and understandable
- No explanation required
- Recognizable to both audience and external stakeholders
- Natural language that feels authentic

**Weaknesses**:
- Less distinctive (could apply to any leader of any movement)
- Doesn't capture the systematic, infrastructure-focused approach
- Less aligned with Alan Hirsch's specific "movemental" framework

#### Tertiary Terms (Used Less Frequently)

- **"Thought Leaders"**: Used in some business documents, but too generic

#### Key Insight

**The audience does not naturally self-identify as "movemental leaders."** They identify by their role (pastor, professor, church planter) or function (leader, teacher, catalyst). The term "movemental leader" is Movemental's framing of who they are, not their own self-description.

However, when introduced to the term in the context of Movemental's value proposition, they recognize themselves: "Oh, I am a movemental leader—I do catalyze movements, I do think in terms of multiplication, I do build networks."
