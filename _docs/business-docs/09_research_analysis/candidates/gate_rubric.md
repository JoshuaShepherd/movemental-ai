## Movemental Leader Gate Rubric

### Purpose
Provide a living standard for identifying, evaluating, and onboarding the right leaders into the Movemental platform. This rubric synthesizes Movemental’s strategic narrative, governance expectations, and real examples (Brad Brisco, Alan Hirsch, and the current candidate roster) to help future agents make consistent judgments.

---

## Prototype Archetypes

### Alan Hirsch (Platform Architect)
- **Qualities**: Decades-long theological contribution (APEST, mDNA), global influence, deep relational network, appetite for experimentation, urgency to preserve/archive work.
- **Implications for rubric**: High bar for theological depth, commitment to movement multiplication, value of legacy content requiring digitization.

### Brad Brisco (Network Amplifier)
- **Qualities**: Connector across denominations, prolific content curator, constant discovery of new pioneers, bias for action.
- **Implications**: Leaders should extend Movemental’s network effect, introduce new cohorts, and model collaborative posture.

Use these prototypes as “north stars” when assessing candidates: they combine apostolic imagination, credibility, and willingness to experiment with new infrastructure.

## Ideal Movemental Leader Profile

1. **Missionally Proven**: Demonstrated track record in microchurch, missional community, or movement-building contexts (not simply institutional leadership).
2. **Content-Rich**: Regularly produces sermons, essays, podcasts, research, or curriculum that can be captured and amplified.
3. **Audience Stewards**: Maintains communities (digital or physical) eager for deeper engagement and resources.
4. **Collaborative Scenius Mindset**: Values citing, amplifying, and co-creating with peers; resists platform individualism.
5. **Platform Ownership Appetite**: Wants independence from extractive publishers/tech platforms; open to revenue experiments.
6. **AI-Positive Integrity**: Welcomes AI tools that preserve voice, maintain theological integrity, and uphold transparency.
7. **Network Gateway**: Can invite other credible leaders (residencies, cohorts, organizations) once onboarded.

When future candidates fit at least 5/7 of these attributes, they likely deserve engagement.

## Gate Rubric (100 Points)

| Pillar | Points | Description | Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Movement Alignment & Theology** | 25 | Alignment with missional/incarnational theology, proven APEST/multiplication frameworks | Books, training programs, endorsements from Hirsch/Brisco networks |
| **Content Velocity & Quality** | 20 | Consistent production of substantive work across formats | Publishing cadence, curriculum, podcast episodes |
| **Audience Reach & Engagement** | 15 | Size and responsiveness of communities, cohorts, or mailing lists | Conference attendance, newsletter size, cohort enrollment |
| **Economic Readiness** | 15 | Existing or planned revenue engines (courses, subscriptions, products) | Shopify stores, Patreon, donor networks ready to convert |
| **Platform Ownership Mindset** | 10 | Desire to control data/audience, frustration with traditional publishing | Statements about independence, existing self-hosted experiments |
| **Network Contribution** | 10 | Ability to introduce additional leaders/organizations | Stewardship of residencies, executive roles (Forge, Tampa UG, etc.) |
| **Operational Capacity & Governance Fit** | 5 | Team infrastructure, compliance with Movemental governance and AI transparency | Staff/volunteer support, data sensitivity awareness |

**Readiness Bands**  
- **High (85-100)**: Immediate invite candidate (e.g., Jeff Vanderstelt, Dave Ferguson, Rob Wegner/Brian Johnson).  
- **Medium (70-84)**: Engage via discovery + prototype project (e.g., JR Woodward, Mike Frost, Lucas Pulley).  
- **Emerging (55-69)**: Nurture, provide resources to raise capacity (e.g., Scott Brennan, Tiffany Smith).  
- **Below 55**: Monitor only; document blockers.

## Decision Workflow

1. **Foundation Scan**
   - Review Movemental docs (strategic narrative, governance) before each evaluation.
   - Log initial assumptions: existing content formats, networks, and potential red flags.
2. **Rubric Scoring**
   - Score each pillar using evidence. Require at least two sources (Movemental docs + web).
3. **Narrative Assessment**
   - Write a short “Movemental fit” story describing how platform ownership, AI preservation, and network effects would serve them.
4. **Recommendation Tier**
   - Assign readiness band and note prerequisites (e.g., need for revenue plan).
5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Share with Movemental leadership (Alan/Brad/Josh) for overrides or additional context.
6. **Onboarding Path**
   - If approved, map platform rollout: content migration priorities, AI agents needed, network launch moment.

## Candidate Examples (Applying the Rubric)

### High Readiness
- **Jeff Vanderstelt**: Scores high in theology, content, audience, and platform mindset due to Saturate/Soma ecosystems.
- **Rob Wegner & Brian Johnson**: KC Underground demonstrates content velocity and network contribution; ready for Movemental-powered LMS.
- **Dave Ferguson**: Exponential/NewThing reach, plus explicit desire for platform innovation; ideal flagship.

### Medium Readiness
- **JR Woodward / V3**: Deep theological frameworks and cohort infrastructure, yet needs platform migration strategy.
- **Lucas Pulley & Tampa Underground**: Strong network value and content backlog; requires collaborative governance model.
- **Mike Frost**: Legacy content and global stage presence, but must plan for rights/republishing.

### Emerging Readiness
- **Scott Brennan**: Creative storyteller with limited scale; Movemental can accelerate reach.
- **Tiffany Smith**: Fresh missional voice; needs support to build durable content pipeline.
- **Mark & Emma Cotterill / Mike Jerell**: Promising but require clearer audience metrics and monetization plans.

These lived examples refine scoring calibration and provide precedent for future decisions.

## Ideal Movemental Leader/Creator (Clean Proposal)

> A Movemental leader is an apostolic storyteller who already shapes microchurch ecosystems, produces substantive content weekly, and hungers for infrastructure that preserves their voice, multiplies their reach 28x, and keeps 90% of revenue under their control. They embody scenius: citing peers, elevating protégés, and inviting networks like Forge, V3, Tampa Underground, or Exponential into collaborative publishing experiments. They treat AI as a covenant partner—transparent, ethical, and protective of theological integrity. Their adoption catalyzes two things simultaneously: a compelling case study for Movemental’s platform story and a floodgate of additional leaders ready to follow their example.

Use this statement when communicating expectations to prospective leaders.

## Future Scoring Guidance

1. **Evidence-Based Inputs**: Require links/screenshots or doc references for every score (stored alongside dossiers).
2. **Calibrated Benchmarks**:
   - **Content Velocity**: Weekly output = 18-20 points; monthly = 12-15; sporadic = <10.
   - **Audience Reach**: >25K engaged = 14-15 points; 5K-25K = 9-13; <5K = ≤8.
   - **Economic Readiness**: Existing course/storefront = 13-15; donation-only = 8-10; unsupported = <8.
3. **Bias Checks**: Compare new candidate scores with existing examples (e.g., Jeff vs. JR vs. Scott) to avoid inflation.
4. **Network Impact Bonus**: When a candidate unlocks multiple introductions (e.g., Forge America), add qualitative note even if numerical score stays constant.
5. **Lifecycle Tracking**: Re-score annually to reflect growth; archive previous versions for trend analysis.
