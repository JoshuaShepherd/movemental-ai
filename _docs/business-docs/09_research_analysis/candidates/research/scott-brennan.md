# Scott Brennan

## Profile
UK-based digital creative documenting contextual church planting experiments via video essays, photo journalism, and interviews of bivocational pioneers inside Forge UK circles.

## Fit Assessment
Scott clearly embodies the DIY, contextual storyteller Movemental wants, but he still needs help building sustainable revenue and operational support—he’s a great experimental partner yet requires scaffolding before a full launch.
