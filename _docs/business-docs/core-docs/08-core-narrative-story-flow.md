## The Five Frames: How to Tell the Movemental Story

Each frame below represents a complete way to present Movemental to a potential movemental leader. Choose the frame based on what you know about them, what matters most to them, and where they are in their journey.

---

## FRAME 1: "You're Already Doing the Work"
### The Capture-and-Amplify Frame

**Central Claim**: You're already creating valuable content every week—sermons, talks, conversations, insights—but most of it evaporates within days. The gap isn't that you need to create more; it's that you're not capturing and leveraging what you're already producing.

**The Problem**: 
- 48 sermons preached last year—where did they go?
- Conference talks that could be teaching resources—lost on someone's hard drive
- Insights from books you've written—isolated in print, unsearchable online
- Wisdom from decades of practice—only available to people who can access you directly

**The Solution**: 
- Capture what you're already creating
- Let AI assist in repurposing it (sermon → article, talk → resource)
- Publish it within a network that amplifies it
- Watch as work you've already done finds new audiences for years to come

**The Multiplier**: When you publish within a network of aligned leaders, everything multiplies. Your sermon reaches 300 people. That same content, published in a network, reaches 30,000 people over the next year. Same work. Different infrastructure.

**The Invitation**: You don't need to create new content to start. You need to capture what you're already creating and let infrastructure amplify it.

## FRAME 2: "The Credibility Crisis"
### The AI-and-Trust Frame

**Central Claim**: We're entering a credibility collapse. AI can now generate infinite plausible-sounding content on any topic, making it nearly impossible to distinguish real expertise from synthetic fluency. Credibility now requires what AI can't easily fake: embeddedness in networks of verified humans who vouch for each other through sustained, substantive work.

**The Problem**:
- 40-60% of online content is now AI-generated or AI-assisted
- Traditional credibility signals (volume, polish, presence) no longer work
- 68% of internet users report difficulty determining if content is AI-generated
- Real expertise is becoming invisible in the noise

**The Solution**: Scenius (collaborative genius, network verification)
- Publish alongside other verified experts
- Reference each other's work in visible, indexed ways
- Your credibility is vouched for by other credible people
- The network creates accountability (bad actors get exposed)
- Relationships are transparent and traceable

**Why This Matters**: You have real credibility. Earned credibility. Decades-of-work credibility. The question is: Will that credibility be visible and verifiable in a world drowning in generated content?

**The Invitation**: Join a network of credible peers. Publish within a scenius that elevates all members. Build collective credibility that compounds over time.

## FRAME 3: "The Math of Amplification"
### The Data-Driven Frame

**Central Claim**: Your content is reaching 1-5% of the people it could reach—not because it's not good enough, but because individual platforms can't compete with network effects. The math is clear: a single author on Substack reaches 25K-50K people annually; the same author in a 100-person network reaches 400K-600K people (28x amplification).

**The Problem**:
- Individual platform: ~25,000-35,000 annual reach
- Page 1 SEO: ~15% of articles
- Revenue potential: $200-800/month
- Discoverability: Limited to people who already know you

**The Solution**: Network platform (100 users)
- Annual reach: 400,000-600,000 people (28x increase)
- Page 1 SEO: 85% of articles (5.7x increase)
- Revenue potential: $3,000-8,000/month (10-15x increase)
- Discoverability: Network audience + organic search + cross-pollination

**The Five Multipliers**:
1. SEO Network Effect (15-25x)
2. Cross-Pollination Effect (8-12x)
3. Content Amplification Effect (10-15x)
4. Authority Transfer Effect (3-5x)
5. Revenue Compound Effect (6-8x)

**The Invitation**: You could keep building solo and reach 1-5% of your potential audience. Or you could join a network and multiply your impact 28x-500x. The math isn't subtle.

## FRAME 4: "From Solo to Scenius"
### The Values and Philosophy Frame

**Central Claim**: The dominant model of digital publishing—build your own platform, grow your own audience, protect your own brand—is exhausting, isolating, and increasingly ineffective. It also contradicts the core values of movement: mutual elevation, collaborative genius, and the belief that we're stronger together than apart.

**The Problem**:
- Exhaustion: You're supposed to write, be active on social media, build your email list, engage with comments, optimize for SEO, create video content, start a podcast, protect your brand, analyze metrics, stay ahead of algorithm changes—and also do the actual work you're called to do
- Isolation: Building your own platform, growing your own audience, protecting your own brand, competing for attention
- Ineffectiveness: Individual platforms get lost in the noise, credibility requires network verification, AI makes solo voices less distinguishable

**The Solution**: Scenius (collaborative genius)
- Publish within a network of aligned thinkers
- Build collective credibility through mutual elevation
- Share audience rather than hoarding it
- Collaborate on ideas rather than protecting IP
- Reference and build on each other rather than competing

**Why This Matters**: This isn't just strategically smart. It's morally better. It reflects the reality that ideas come from conversations, not isolated genius; credibility is relational, not individual; influence is magnified through networks, not diminished by sharing.

**The Invitation**: If you're exhausted by solo platform building, if you believe collaboration beats competition, if you want your digital practice to reflect kingdom values—this is for you.

## FRAME 5: "The Movement Infrastructure"
### The Vision and Calling Frame

**Central Claim**: Movements require infrastructure. The early church had letters, house church networks, and traveling apostles. The Reformation had the printing press. Civil rights had buses, churches, and newsletters. Every movement that spread did so through infrastructure that made ideas shareable, leaders connectable, and practices replicable.

**The Problem**: 
- What infrastructure exists to help your work spread beyond the people you can personally reach?
- Not social media (that's not infrastructure, that's rent-seeking)
- Not your individual website (that's a tool, not infrastructure)
- Not traditional publishing (that's too slow and too gatekept)

**The Solution**: Movement infrastructure for the digital age
- Amplifies every member through network effects
- Maintains movemental values in digital space
- Makes substantive work discoverable
- Connects leaders to each other
- Provides sustainable economics
- Ensures quality and credibility

**The Vision**: In five years, 500+ carefully selected movement leaders publishing regularly, 2-3 million people per year encountering this content, Page 1 SEO dominance for movemental/missional topics, measurable embodied impact in communities across the country, proof that digital publishing can serve movement without replicating consumerism.

**The Invitation**: Your work matters. But right now, your work is reaching what percentage of the people who need it? 5%? Maybe 10%? Not because you're not doing enough. But because infrastructure doesn't exist to amplify movemental work at scale. We're building the infrastructure your calling actually requires.

## Choosing the Right Frame

**Frame 1 ("You're Already Doing the Work")** is best for:
- Leaders who feel overwhelmed by content creation demands
- Those with significant archives that aren't digitally accessible
- People who don't see themselves as "writers" but have valuable content
- Those who need to see the practical path forward

**Frame 2 ("The Credibility Crisis")** is best for:
- Intellectually-minded leaders concerned about AI and trust
- Those who've thought about authenticity in digital spaces
- Leaders with deep expertise who feel lost in digital noise
- People motivated by philosophical/ethical arguments

**Frame 3 ("The Math of Amplification")** is best for:
- Data-driven decision makers
- Leaders who need to see ROI and concrete numbers
- Those convinced by evidence over philosophy
- People who want to understand exactly how it works

**Frame 4 ("From Solo to Scenius")** is best for:
- Leaders who are exhausted by platform-building
- Those who feel tension between digital practice and kingdom values
- People who value collaboration but haven't found the right vehicle
- Leaders motivated by alignment between practice and belief

**Frame 5 ("The Movement Infrastructure")** is best for:
- Movement leaders/founders who think systemically
- Those with a strong sense of calling and legacy
- Leaders who want to be part of building something larger
- People motivated by historical precedent and long-term vision

## Using Multiple Frames

Often, you'll use more than one frame in sequence:

1. **Start with Frame 1 or 3** (practical/data) to establish "this solves a real problem"
2. **Move to Frame 2 or 4** (values/philosophy) to show "this aligns with what you believe"
3. **Close with Frame 5** (vision) to inspire "this is bigger than just your individual need"

The frames aren't mutually exclusive—they're different lenses on the same reality. Choose based on who you're talking to and what matters most to them.
