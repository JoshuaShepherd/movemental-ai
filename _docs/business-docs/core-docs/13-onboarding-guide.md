## Philosophy: Coach the Cook, Not the Stove

**Core Insight**: Movemental leaders are movement leaders, not bloggers. They need strategic coaching on amplifying their movemental impact through digital publishing, not technical training on platform features.

**The Platform Promise**: "You have the best stove. We've handled the tech. Let's focus on what you're cooking."

**Your Role**: Movement coach + digital strategist + accountability partner (not tech support)
