# Metrics & Signals (What You Watch)
## Engagement Signals, Formation Indicators, Credibility Growth, What You Don't Optimize For

**Purpose**: Focus on what matters. Clear articulation of the metrics and signals that indicate real success—formation, credibility, impact—versus vanity metrics that don't matter.

**Audience**: Internal

**Status**: Foundational Document - MVP-Complete / Pre-Scale

## Core Principle: Formation Over Growth

**Commitment**: We measure formation indicators, credibility growth, and embodied transformation—not just engagement metrics, follower counts, or revenue numbers. The goal is movemental impact, not platform metrics.

**The Framework**: Three layers of metrics—digital metrics (necessary but insufficient), relational metrics (getting closer), and embodiment metrics (what actually matters).

---

## Digital Metrics (Necessary but Insufficient)

### What We Track

**Platform Performance**:
- Page views and unique visitors
- Time on page and depth of engagement
- Newsletter subscriptions and open rates
- Content shares and backlinks
- SEO rankings and organic traffic
- Revenue and support patterns

**Why We Track These**:
- Technical platform performance validation
- Content discovery and reach measurement
- Audience growth and engagement patterns
- Revenue sustainability indicators
- SEO and search visibility assessment

**Why They're Insufficient**:
- They don't measure actual transformation
- They can be gamed or optimized without impact
- They focus on consumption, not formation
- They don't capture embodied change
- They don't measure movement multiplication

### How We Use Them

**As Indicators, Not Goals**:
- Technical validation (platform works)
- Discovery measurement (content found)
- Growth tracking (audience expanding)
- Revenue monitoring (sustainable economics)

**Not As Primary Success Metrics**:
- We don't optimize for vanity metrics
- We don't chase follower counts
- We don't prioritize viral content
- We don't measure success by engagement alone

## Relational Metrics (Getting Closer)

### What We Track

**Relationship Indicators**:
- **Repeat Readership**: Are the same people returning? (Suggests relationship, not just casual discovery)
- **Commenting and Substantive Engagement**: Are people asking questions, sharing their own stories? (Suggests dialog, not just consumption)
- **Direct Communication**: Are readers emailing authors, requesting conversations? (Suggests relationship formation)
- **Cross-Platform Engagement**: Are readers following multiple network authors? (Suggests investment in the network, not just individuals)
- **In-Person Connections**: Are online relationships leading to offline meetings, collaborations? (Suggests embodiment)

**Why These Matter**:
- They indicate relationship formation, not just consumption
- They suggest movement engagement, not just content consumption
- They measure network investment, not just individual followership
- They capture authentic connection, not just metrics

### How We Measure

**Quantitative Indicators**:
- Repeat visitor percentage
- Comment-to-view ratio
- Email response rate
- Cross-author subscriber overlap
- In-person meeting tracking

**Qualitative Assessment**:
- Comment quality and depth
- Email conversation substance
- Relationship development patterns
- Network participation depth
- Embodiment evidence in communication

## Embodiment Metrics (What Actually Matters)

### What We Track

**Surveys and Stories** (Quarterly):
- How has the content you've read here influenced your actual daily life?
- Have you changed any practices because of what you've learned?
- Have you had conversations with others in your community about these ideas?
- Have you taken any actions (in your church, neighborhood, work) informed by this content?
- Can you tell us a specific story of how this content mattered?

**What We're Looking For**:
- **Changed Practices**: "I started meeting with my neighbors"
- **Initiated Conversations**: "I talked with my small group about..."
- **Organizational Shifts**: "Our church began to..."
- **Embodied Transformation**: Evidence of actual change in daily life
- **Movement Multiplication**: Practices spreading to others

**Why These Matter**:
- They measure actual transformation, not just engagement
- They capture movement multiplication, not just content consumption
- They validate embodied change, not just digital metrics
- They confirm movemental impact, not just platform success

### How We Measure

**Quarterly Surveys**:
- Reader impact surveys
- Author transformation stories
- Movement multiplication evidence
- Embodied change documentation

**Story Collection**:

## What We Don't Optimize For

### Vanity Metrics

**What We Avoid**:
- **Follower Counts**: Raw numbers don't indicate impact
- **Viral Content**: Virality doesn't measure transformation
- **Engagement Rates**: High engagement doesn't mean deep formation
- **Page Views**: Views don't measure actual influence
- **Social Media Metrics**: Likes and shares don't indicate credibility

**Why We Don't Optimize For These**:
- They don't measure actual transformation
- They can be gamed or manipulated
- They focus on consumption, not formation
- They don't capture movement multiplication
- They don't validate embodied change

### Growth Without Formation

**What We Avoid**:
- Rapid growth without substance
- Audience expansion without engagement
- Content volume without quality
- Network size without depth
- Revenue without impact

**Why We Don't Optimize For These**:
- Formation is more important than growth
- Quality creates sustainable growth
- Substance creates lasting impact
- Depth creates credibility
- Impact validates success
