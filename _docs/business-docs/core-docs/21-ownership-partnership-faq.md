## The Core Truth: You're Entering a Partnership, Not Buying Software

**The simplest honest statement of what we're doing**:

Movemental is not selling software. Movemental is forming long-term publishing partnerships with a small number of movement leaders, using a shared but extensible platform, in which:

- **Authors own their work**
- **Movemental operates and evolves the platform**
- **Revenue is shared by design**
- **Separation is possible, but not frictionless by default, because the value comes from the partnership and the ecosystem**

If someone thinks they are buying an app, confusion ensues. If they understand they are entering a partnership, everything makes sense.

## What Authors Own (Always)

### In Plain Language

**Authors always own**:

- **All original intellectual property**
  - Text, audio, video, course content
  - Assessments they author
  - Any original creative work they produce

- **Their name, brand, and likeness**
  - Complete control over their personal brand
  - How they present themselves
  - Their reputation and public identity

- **Their audience**
  - Email lists and subscriber data
  - Direct relationships with readers
  - Audience insights and analytics (their portion)

- **Their domain** (if custom domain is used)
  - Domain registration in their name
  - Control over domain DNS settings

- **Their revenue, minus the agreed share**
  - 90% of all revenue generated through the platform
  - Complete transparency and control over revenue
  - Direct payment processing and access

### What This Means

**Movemental never owns**:
- Copyright to your content
- Your theological or intellectual voice
- Your future publishing decisions outside the platform
- Your audience relationships
- Your brand or personal identity

**You can**:
- Use your content elsewhere (subject to reasonable transition rules)
- Maintain complete control over your voice and message
- Make independent publishing decisions
- Own and control your audience relationships
- Preserve your intellectual property rights

## What Movemental Owns

### Platform Infrastructure

**Movemental owns**:

- **The platform infrastructure**
  - Codebase and software systems
  - Database schemas and data architecture
  - Agent systems and AI capabilities
  - Design system and UI components
  - Deployment tooling and automation

- **The multi-tenant architecture**
  - Platform that supports multiple authors
  - Shared infrastructure and services
  - Network integration and collaboration tools

- **The operational systems**
  - Payment processing orchestration
  - Analytics and insights infrastructure
  - SEO and discovery tooling
  - Agent memory systems
  - Security and compliance systems

  - 10% revenue share for platform operation
  - Platform development and evolution
  - Network management and curation

### Why This Matters

**Movemental is not a hosting provider alone** — it is an operator and steward. We operate and evolve the platform, maintain network quality, develop new capabilities, and ensure the ecosystem serves movemental leaders well.

**Authors benefit from**:
- Platform that evolves and improves over time
- Network effects and amplification
- Ongoing support and development
- Quality maintenance and curation
- Strategic partnership and stewardship

## How the 10% Revenue Share Actually Works

### Conceptual Explanation (Non-Technical)

**All revenue generated through the platform flows through a shared payment system that automatically allocates**:
- **90% to the author**
- **10% to Movemental**
- **at the moment of transaction**

### Key Points

- **Authors never invoice Movemental** — revenue flows directly
- **Movemental never manually takes money** — split happens automatically
- **The split is transparent, automatic, and auditable** — you can see every transaction
- **Authors can see every transaction** — complete transparency

### Technical Implementation (If Asked)

"We use Stripe Connect to do this safely and transparently. This ensures:
- Automatic revenue splitting at the moment of payment
- Secure payment processing
- Transparent transaction records
- Direct payment to your account (not through Movemental)"

## What Happens If an Author "Backs Out"?

### Content Ownership (Simple)

**If an author leaves**:
- They retain ownership of all content they created
- They may reuse it elsewhere (subject to reasonable transition rules)
- No drama here — your content is yours

### Platform & App (The Key Distinction)

**This is where clarity prevents fear**:

**You are not purchasing a standalone app.**  
**You are joining a managed publishing platform.**

**So if you leave, you do not receive**:
- The codebase
- The agent systems
- The platform infrastructure
- The multi-tenant architecture

**Why?**

Because:
- **The value is in the ecosystem** — network effects, collaboration, scenius credibility
- **The platform is evolving** — it's continuously developed and improved
- **It would be irresponsible** (and unsafe) to "hand over" a complex system that requires ongoing operation and maintenance
- **This is standard in managed platforms** — it's just usually hidden

**This is like**:
- Working with a world-class publisher + product team (not buying Squarespace)
- Being part of a managed ecosystem (not owning independent infrastructure)
- A long-term partnership (not a software purchase)

### Reasonable Exit Paths

**We offer humane exits because we're confident in the partnership value**:

1. **Content Export**
   - Clean markdown / HTML export of all your work
   - Complete content archive
   - No lock-in on your intellectual property

2. **Redirect Grace Period**
   - URLs redirect for a reasonable transition period (typically 3-6 months)
   - Graceful transition for your audience
   - No abrupt cut-off

3. **Optional Paid Transition Support**
   - Help migrating to another platform (extra cost, if desired)
   - Transition consulting and support
   - Professional handoff if needed

**This communicates confidence, not weakness.** We offer these because we believe the partnership value will keep you here, not because we're trying to lock you in.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture and "Control"

### What Authors Actually Control

**Authors control**:
- **Content** — what you create, when you publish, what you say
- **Structure** — what exists on your platform, what doesn't
- **Voice** — your authentic voice, style, theology
- **Pricing** — what you charge for subscriptions, courses, etc.
- **Publishing cadence** — how often you publish, your editorial calendar
- **What agents are used and how** — AI assistance settings and preferences

### What Authors Don't Control (And Why That's Good)

**Authors do not control**:
- **Low-level design primitives** — core design system elements
- **Platform architecture** — technical infrastructure and systems
- **Core UX patterns** — fundamental user experience patterns

**Why this is good**:
- **Constraint creates coherence** — consistent experience builds credibility
- **Coherence builds credibility** — network benefits from shared standards
- **Quality is maintained** — platform quality ensures all authors benefit
- **Network effects work** — shared infrastructure enables amplification

**This is closer to working with a world-class publisher + product team than using Squarespace.**

### Design Customization (How It Works)

**There is a core design system**:
- Approved templates and patterns
- Consistent quality and coherence
- Network-wide credibility benefits

**Authors can**:
- Choose from approved templates
- Request adaptations within the system
- Work with their designer in collaboration with us
- Customize within approved parameters

**But**:
- **Deep customization = additional cost** (because it adds complexity to a shared system)
- This is normal and reasonable
- Most authors don't need deep customization
- Templates provide excellent starting points

## Why the Price Is Low (But Not Cheap)

### The Moral Frame (Not Technical)

**We are intentionally underpricing because**:

1. **AI has changed the cost curve** — we can deliver at revolutionary prices
2. **We believe movement leaders have been structurally underpaid** — traditional models extract too much value
3. **We want alignment, not extraction** — we succeed when you succeed
4. **We are betting on long-term partnership, not short-term fees** — revenue share creates alignment

**And**:
- **This pricing is limited** because this level of partnership does not scale infinitely
- **The limit feels protective, not manipulative** — it preserves quality and partnership value
- **Not everyone qualifies** — we maintain quality through selective partnership

---

## The Agreement Model (Conceptual Overview)

**The agreement is essentially four things**:

1. **A Platform Participation Agreement**
   - Terms of participation in the Movemental network
   - Quality standards and expectations
   - Network participation requirements

2. **A Revenue Share Agreement**
   - 90/10 revenue split
   - Payment processing and distribution
   - Revenue transparency and reporting

3. **A Content License (Non-Exclusive, Operational)**
   - Movemental can operate the platform with your content
   - You retain all ownership and rights
   - Non-exclusive license for platform operation only

4. **A Data & Privacy Agreement**
   - How data is used and protected
   - Privacy and security standards
   - Data ownership and control

**You own your content. Movemental operates the platform. Revenue is shared. Partnership is long-term.**

## The Partnership Metaphor

### What We're Really Doing

**You are not**:
- Buying software
- Renting a platform
- Using a SaaS tool
- Hiring an agency (one-time)

**You are**:
- Entering a long-term publishing partnership
- Joining a managed publishing ecosystem
- Participating in a scenius network
- Partnering with a movemental infrastructure steward

### The Right Metaphor

**Movemental is like**:
- A managed, agentic, formation-centered publishing cooperative
- A world-class publisher + product team partnership
- A movemental infrastructure steward
- A scenius network operator

**Not like**:
- SaaS platforms (transactional, replaceable)
- Agencies (one-time, extractive)
- Publishers (own your content, take 90%)
- Marketplaces (platform owns relationships)

## Common Questions

### "Can I leave anytime?"

Yes, but remember you're in a partnership, not a software subscription. We offer reasonable exit paths (content export, redirect grace period, optional transition support) but you don't take the platform infrastructure with you because that's not what you're purchasing.

### "What if I want to customize the design?"

We have approved templates and patterns. You can choose templates, request adaptations, or work with your designer in collaboration with us. Deep customization beyond the design system is possible but involves additional cost because it adds complexity to a shared system.

### "Do I really own my content?"

Yes. Absolutely. You own all your original intellectual property, your content, your voice, your audience, your brand. Movemental operates the platform with your content (non-exclusive license) but you retain complete ownership and can use your content elsewhere.

### "What if Movemental shuts down?"

Your content is yours. We'd provide content export and reasonable transition support. But we're building for long-term sustainability, not short-term extraction — the partnership model creates alignment for long-term success.

### "Why 10%? Why not less?"

10% enables platform operation, development, and network stewardship. It's intentionally low because we believe in alignment over extraction. We succeed when you succeed. The low percentage reflects our commitment to partnership, not extraction.

### "Can I use my content elsewhere?"

Yes, subject to reasonable transition rules. You own your content. The platform participation agreement includes a non-exclusive license for platform operation, but you retain all rights to use your content elsewhere.
