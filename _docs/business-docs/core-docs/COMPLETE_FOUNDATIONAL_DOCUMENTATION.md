# Complete Movemental Foundational Documentation
## Agent Instructions for Documentation Creation

**Purpose**: This document provides complete instructions for creating the full set of Movemental foundational documentation as outlined in the Movemental Documentation Index.

**Status**: Instructions for MVP-Complete / Pre-Scale Documentation

---

## Your Mission

You are tasked with creating the complete set of foundational documentation for Movemental as specified in the Movemental Documentation Index. This documentation will serve as the minimum complete set that allows Movemental to:

- Explain what they built
- Explain why it matters
- Explain how it works
- Explain how it grows
- Explain how people participate
- Explain how they stay true while scaling

**All documentation should be written in Movemental's voice**: thoughtful, clear, substantive, aligned with movemental values. This is not marketing fluff—it's foundational clarity for those building, stewarding, and participating in Movemental.

---

## How to Use the Index

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any document, consult `movemental-documentation-index.md` in this directory.

The index maps each documentation area to:
1. **Best Sources** - The most authoritative existing documents
2. **Why Each Source** - Explanation of why it's recommended
3. **What It Covers** - What content the source provides
4. **How to Use It** - How to use the source for that documentation area

**Your Process**:
1. Read the index entry for the document you're creating
2. Read all "Best Sources" listed for that area
3. Read "Additional Context" sources if needed for depth
4. Synthesize the content into a new foundational document
5. Maintain Movemental's voice throughout

---

**Avoid**:
- Marketing hype
- Overpromising
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Vague statements
- Individual empire-building language (use scenius language instead)

---

## Work Process

1. **Start with the Index**: Read `movemental-documentation-index.md` for the area you're working on.

2. **Read All Sources**: Read all "Best Sources" listed for that area. Take notes on:
   - Key concepts
   - Voice patterns
   - Structure approaches
   - Content to synthesize

3. **Read Additional Context**: If needed, read "Additional Context" sources for depth.

4. **Synthesize**: Create the new document by:
   - Synthesizing content from multiple sources
   - Maintaining Movemental's voice
   - Following the "Must Include" requirements
   - Adding your own synthesis and clarity

5. **Structure**: Use clear headings, sections, and formatting. Make it scannable but substantive.

6. **Review**: Before finalizing, check:
   - Does it meet all "Must Include" requirements?
   - Is the voice consistent with Movemental's voice?
   - Is it clear and accessible to the intended audience?
   - Does it synthesize rather than just copy?

---

## Quality Standards

Each document should be:
- **Complete**: Addresses all "Must Include" requirements
- **Authoritative**: Draws from best sources, synthesizes well
- **Clear**: Accessible to intended audience
- **Substantive**: Real content, not fluff
- **Voice-consistent**: Maintains Movemental's voice throughout
- **Well-structured**: Clear headings, scannable, organized
- **Actionable**: Where appropriate, provides practical guidance

---

## Final Notes

- **This is foundational documentation**: It should be comprehensive, authoritative, and serve as the source of truth.

- **Not all documents are public**: Documents 18-20 are drafts, not public yet. Mark them clearly.

- **Synthesis over copying**: Don't just copy from sources. Synthesize, clarify, and create new clarity.

- **Voice matters**: Movemental's voice is distinctive. Study existing documentation to capture it.

- **Completeness matters**: This is the minimum complete set. Each document should be comprehensive enough to stand alone.

---

## Getting Started

1. Read this entire instruction document
2. Read `movemental-documentation-index.md` to understand the source mapping
3. Start with Section I (Foundational Alignment Documents) - these are the most important
4. Work through each section systematically
5. Create each document as a separate markdown file in this directory
6. Maintain consistency in voice, structure, and quality throughout

**You have everything you need to complete this assignment. The index provides the sources. This document provides the structure. Your task is to synthesize and create.**

Good luck. This documentation will serve Movemental for years to come. Make it count.
