# Movemental Documentation Index

## Purpose

This directory contains the **Movemental Documentation Index**—a comprehensive mapping of the ideal foundational documentation structure to the best existing sources within the Movemental workspace.

## Contents

- **`movemental-documentation-index.md`** - The complete index mapping each area of the Movemental Documentation Index to the best sources in the workspace.

## How to Use This Index

1. **Find Sources**: When you need to create or update foundational documentation, consult this index to find the best existing sources.

2. **Understand Context**: Each entry explains why a source is recommended and what it covers, helping you understand which documents to reference.

3. **Maintain Voice**: All sources listed maintain Movemental's voice—thoughtful, clear, substantive, aligned with movemental values. Use these as voice reference when creating new documentation.

4. **Identify Gaps**: If an area has limited sources, it may indicate where new documentation needs to be created.

## Structure

The index is organized according to the Movemental Documentation Index structure:

- **I. Foundational Alignment Documents** - Vision, credibility thesis, principles & values
- **II. Product Definition Documents** - MVP definition, platform overview, features, design system
- **III. Go-To-Market & Narrative Documents** - Core narrative, founder narrative, pricing, one-pagers
- **IV. Author & User Experience Documents** - Author journey, onboarding, agentic behavior
- **V. Internal Operating Documents** - Operating model, metrics, risk register
- **VI. Future-Facing Documents** - Roadmap, network expansion, partner pathways

## Implementation Status

**`28-implementation-status.md`** - Comprehensive assessment of what actually exists in the platform as of December 2025. This document reflects the actual implementation status based on codebase analysis, while other documents represent the intended vision and strategy. Use this document to understand the current state of the platform versus the documented vision.

## Maintenance

This index should be updated as:
- New documentation is created
- Existing documentation evolves
- New sources become more authoritative
- Documentation structure changes

*This index serves as a practical guide for building Movemental's foundational documentation, ensuring consistency, completeness, and alignment with Movemental's voice and values.*
