## Key Information for Next Agent

### Documentation Pattern Established

**Structure**: Each document follows this pattern:
1. Title and purpose statement
2. Audience and status
3. Main content sections (comprehensive, authoritative)
4. Conclusion/summary
5. Footer note about document purpose

**Voice**: Movemental's voice—thoughtful, clear, substantive, aligned with movemental values. Not marketing, but practical guidance.

**Sources**: All documents are synthesized from the source files listed in `movemental-documentation-index.md`. Each document should:
- Reference key sources from the index
- Synthesize content (not copy-paste)
- Maintain Movemental's voice
- Be comprehensive and authoritative

### Important Context

**COMPLETE_FOUNDATIONAL_DOCUMENTATION.md**: This is the master prompt that defines what needs to be created. It includes:
- The governance + trust + narrative framework
- What authors own vs. what Movemental owns
- How the 10% revenue model works
- What happens if an author backs out
- Multi-tenant, design, and control questions
- The documentation set needed (20 documents)

**movemental-documentation-index.md**: This is the source mapping document. It lists:
- Best sources for each document
- Why each source is recommended
- What each source covers
- Additional context sources

### Key Principles to Maintain

1. **Movemental's Voice**: Thoughtful, clear, substantive, aligned with movemental values
2. **Comprehensive**: Each document should be authoritative and complete
3. **Practical**: Not marketing, but practical guidance
4. **Synthesized**: Draw from sources but create new, coherent documents
5. **Formatted**: Ready for core documentation, could transfer to terms & conditions

### Documents Marked DRAFT

Documents 18, 19, and 20 are marked as DRAFT because they are:
- Working documents, not promises
- Future-facing, not current commitments
- Internal planning, not public-facing

These should still be comprehensive but include appropriate disclaimers about their draft status.

## Next Steps

1. Continue with document **11-one-pagers.md**
2. Follow the established pattern and voice
3. Reference `movemental-documentation-index.md` for source mapping
4. Synthesize content from sources, don't copy-paste
5. Maintain Movemental's voice throughout
6. Mark documents 18-20 as DRAFT with appropriate disclaimers
