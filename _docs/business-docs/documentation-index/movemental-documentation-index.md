## Notes on Using This Index

1. **Multiple Sources**: Most areas have multiple sources listed. The first source is typically the most authoritative or comprehensive. Use additional sources for depth, different perspectives, or specific use cases.

2. **Voice Consistency**: All sources listed maintain Movemental's voice—thoughtful, clear, substantive, aligned with movemental values. When creating new documentation, use these sources as voice reference.

3. **Completeness**: This index maps to existing documentation. Some areas may need new documentation created. Use the "Best Sources" as starting points and reference materials.

4. **Evolution**: As documentation evolves, update this index. This is a living document that should reflect the current state of Movemental's knowledge base.

5. **Context Matters**: Some documents serve multiple purposes. The categorization here reflects primary use, but don't hesitate to draw from multiple sections when creating comprehensive documentation.

*This index serves as a practical guide for those building Movemental's foundational documentation. It maps the ideal documentation structure to the best existing sources, providing a clear path from vision to implementation.*
