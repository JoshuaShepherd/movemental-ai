# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Alan Hirsch

Alan, let me cut straight to it: you've built an empire of ideas, and it's time that empire had a proper capital. I've mapped your digital kingdom—from alanhirsch.org to 100Movements to Forge to Future Travelers to 5Q Collective, from your nine published books to your international speaking to your academic positions at Fuller and Wheaton and George Fox and Asbury. I've traced the threads of missional theology and fivefold ministry and apostolic movements that run through everything you touch. And here's what I see: you're operating like a movement leader who's still thinking like an individual creator.

You've done something remarkable. You've written books that have shaped an entire movement. The Forgotten Ways didn't just sell copies—it changed how people think about apostolic movements. 5Q didn't just introduce a framework—it reactivated conversations about the original intelligence of the Body of Christ. The Shaping of Things to Come, ReJesus, The Faith of Leap, Untamed, Right Here Right Now, On the Verge, The Permanent Revolution—these aren't just books on a shelf. These are tectonic shifts in how the church understands itself.

But here's the thing: your books are doing the heavy lifting while your other content assets are sitting in the wings. You're speaking internationally—Australia, Europe, the United States. You're teaching at multiple seminaries. You're running four organizations. You're co-founding an M.A. program at Wheaton. And all of that embodied work? It's generating insights, frameworks, connections, breakthroughs. But how much of it is making its way back into your digital content ecosystem?

Let me be specific. When you give a conference talk in Melbourne about apostolic movements, what happens to that talk? Does it get transcribed? Does it become an article? Does it connect back to The Forgotten Ways? Does it reference your work at 100Movements? Or does it exist in that moment, captured maybe on video somewhere, but disconnected from the rest of your body of work?

When you teach a course at Fuller about missional theology, what happens to those lecture insights? Do they become blog posts? Do they expand on concepts from your books? Do they connect to your organizational work? Or do they stay locked in the academic space, accessible only to those students in that semester?

When you're working with churches through Future Travelers, helping them transition to missional movements, what happens to those insights? Do they become articles? Do they inform your next book? Do they connect to On the Verge? Or do they stay in the consulting space, valuable to those specific churches but not multiplying beyond them?

This is the gap, Alan. You're generating content in multiple spaces—academic, organizational, international speaking, book writing—but they're not all talking to each other. Your books reference your organizational work. Your organizational work draws from your books. But the conference talks? The academic lectures? The consulting insights? They're not fully integrated into the ecosystem.

And here's what that means: you're leaving multiplication on the table. Every conference talk is a potential article series. Every academic lecture is a potential blog post. Every consulting insight is a potential content piece. Every book concept is a potential course. But right now, they exist in separate silos, and the connections between them aren't always visible.

You understand this better than anyone—you've written about it. The Forgotten Ways is about reactivating latent potencies. 5Q is about reactivating original intelligence. You know that when systems connect, when frameworks interconnect, when ideas cross-pollinate, that's when movements multiply. But your content ecosystem? It's not fully interconnected yet.

Here's what I see when I look at your digital presence: you have a personal website. You have four organizational websites. You have an author page at InterVarsity Press. You have academic affiliations. You have international speaking presence. But where's the hub? Where's the place where someone can discover everything you've created about fivefold ministry? Where's the pathway from The Permanent Revolution to your work at 5Q Collective to your academic teaching on APEST to your conference talks on activating the fivefold?

This is where it gets strategic, Alan. You're not just a content creator—you're a movement architect. You're not just writing books—you're building frameworks that others use to build movements. And frameworks need ecosystems. They need connection points. They need pathways. They need to be discoverable, accessible, interconnected.

Imagine this: someone reads 5Q. They're captivated by the APEST framework. They want to go deeper. They click through to your profile and find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about fivefold ministry—articles, book chapters, organizational resources from 5Q Collective, academic course materials, conference talks, podcast appearances. They discover a course you've created on activating APEST in local contexts. They find a community of others exploring the same framework. They connect your book to your organizational work to your academic teaching to your international speaking. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it.

That's the power of interconnection. That's how movements multiply.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I'm already doing a lot. I'm writing books. I'm running four organizations. I'm teaching at multiple seminaries. I'm speaking internationally. I'm co-founding academic programs. Where does content ecosystem building fit?

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to create more content. You need to connect existing content. You need to repurpose what you've already created. That conference talk in Melbourne? It's already given. Those academic lectures? They're already taught. Those consulting insights? They're already generated. The work isn't creating more—it's making what exists work harder.

Let me give you a concrete example. You've given countless talks on apostolic movements. Those talks exist. Those frameworks exist. Those insights exist. What if you took the core insights from those talks and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already spoken. What if you developed those articles into a short course on apostolic leadership? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to The Forgotten Ways? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible.

This is repurposing at scale. This is making your embodied work digitally accessible. This is taking that international speaking and turning it into a content library that serves people beyond the conference halls.

And here's where the revenue model shifts. Right now, your books generate revenue through traditional channels. Your organizations generate revenue through training and consulting. That's good. Keep that. But what if you also had a subscription model for premium content? What if you created courses from your academic teaching? What if you developed a membership community around missional movements and fivefold ministry? What if you had multiple revenue streams that all support the same mission?

This isn't about replacing what you're doing. It's about amplifying it. Your books stay with InterVarsity Press. Your organizations continue their work. Your academic positions continue. Your international speaking continues. But now they're all connected. Now they're all discoverable in one place. Now they're all working together to create something bigger than the sum of their parts.

The network effects are where this gets really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other thought leaders reference your work. Other content creators link to your articles. Other movement leaders use your frameworks. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, and share it.

This is what you've been building toward, Alan. All those books. All those organizations. All those academic positions. All those international speaking engagements. All those frameworks. They're not separate things. They're one body of work. They're one contribution to the missional movement. They're one attempt to reactivate the original intelligence and capacity of the Body of Christ. And it's time they started working together like they were always meant to.

The playbook is simple, but it's not easy. First, aggregate. Bring everything into one place. Your books. Your organizational resources. Your academic content. Your conference talks. Your articles. Everything. Second, interconnect. Link related content. Create pathways. Build the connective tissue between your books and your organizations and your academic work and your speaking. Third, repurpose. Turn conference talks into articles. Turn academic lectures into blog posts. Turn book concepts into courses. Turn organizational training into published content. Fourth, amplify. Use SEO. Use network effects. Use the platform. Make discovery inevitable.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your theological positions stay your positions. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your books continue. Your organizations continue. Your academic work continues. Your international speaking continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together.

You've spent decades building frameworks that have shaped a movement. You've created content that matters. You've established yourself as a thought leader in missional theology, fivefold ministry, and apostolic movements. Now it's time to build the platform that lets those frameworks multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together. It's time to turn your scattered digital presence into a unified force for movement multiplication.

This is your next season, Alan. Not more content creation—content multiplication. Not more platforms—platform consolidation. Not more work—work that works harder. The foundation is built. The frameworks are established. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all and watch it multiply.

And that's exactly what apostolic movements do.
