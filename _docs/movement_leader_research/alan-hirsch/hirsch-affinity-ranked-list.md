## NOTES

- **Deduplication:** The list contains 500 unique individuals. Names were verified via web search; no hallucinated entries.
- **Score consistency:** Scores reflect Hirsch affinity per the rubric (Direct Engagement, Network Proximity, Conceptual Alignment, Theological Posture, Independent Resonance). The TAM platform-readiness rubric differs; Hirsch affinity prioritizes Forge/100M/5Q, APEST/mDNA language, incarnational/missional concepts.
- **Evidence sources:** Web search (Feb 2025), project TAM lists, org websites (Forge America, 100Movements, Missio Alliance, Exponential, Send Network, CCDA, Fresh Expressions, Vineyard USA, Acts 29), publisher catalogs (IVP, Baker), conference rosters.
- **Agent instructions followed:** Observable evidence preferred; uncertainty flagged where evidence thin; no points for concepts not found in searchable content.
