# Hirsch Affinity Rubric (0–100)

## Purpose

This rubric measures the **conceptual and relational affinity** of any published author to Alan Hirsch—i.e., how closely their thought, practice, and positioning align with Hirsch’s body of work. It is designed to be completed **without reading Hirsch’s original books**, using organic search and agentic knowledge: patterns discoverable through web search, citations, affiliations, and observable language.

**Use cases:**
- Ranking authors by Hirsch affinity for content discovery
- Search-and-classification pipelines for movement-leader research
- Mapping author clusters in missional/APEST/movement space
- Identifying hidden affinities (authors who think like Hirsch but don’t cite him)

---

## Design Principle: Search-Completable Without Book Access

Each dimension is scored from evidence that can be found via:

- Web search (articles, bios, interviews)
- Citation / reference analysis
- Organizational affiliations and conference rosters
- Co-authorship and endorsement networks
- Observable vocabulary and conceptual patterns
- AI / agent summaries of publicly available content

**Not required:** Direct access to *The Forgotten Ways*, *Shaping of Things to Come*, *5Q*, or other Hirsch books.

## Hirsch Signature Concepts (Reference for Assessors)

Use these as the conceptual anchor. Affinity is higher when an author references, builds on, or independently expresses these ideas.

| Concept | Observable Signals |
|--------|---------------------|
| **APEST / 5Q** | Fivefold ministry (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher); apostolic environments; Ephesians 4 leadership |
| **mDNA / Apostolic Genius** | Missional DNA; six elements (Jesus is Lord, disciple-making, apostolic environment, missional-incarnational impulse, organic systems, communitas); “reactivating latent” language |
| **Centered set vs. bounded set** | Community defined by movement toward Jesus rather than boundaries; drawing people closer vs. defining in/out |
| **Incarnational mission** | 6 P’s (Presence, Proximity, Prevenience, Passion, Powerlessness, Proclamation); “you can’t commute to mission”; embodied witness |
| **Organic movement vs. institution** | Small, reproducible, networked structures; multiplication over addition; movement DNA over church-growth formulas |
| **Communitas** | Community forged in liminality, shared mission, risk; beyond comfort-based community |
| **Disciple-making systems** | Obedience-based, reproducible, relational discipleship; not information transfer |
| **Missional church** | Church as sent, not gathered-to-consume; mission-shaped ecclesiology |

## Search Process for Ranked Affinity List

### Phase 1: Candidate Discovery

Run these searches to surface candidates; capture name, primary domain, and 1–2 source URLs.

```
"Alan Hirsch" co-author collaborator
"Forge" network faculty leaders missional
"100Movements" "5Q Collective" leaders
"APEST" OR "5Q" OR "fivefold ministry" author
"missional church" author 2020-
"Forgotten Ways" cited recommended
"centered set" "bounded set" church author
"incarnational mission" author practitioner
"Shaping of Things to Come" cited Frost Hirsch
"missional DNA" OR "mDNA" author
"communitas" missional author
```

### Phase 2: Per-Candidate Evidence Gathering

For each candidate:

1. **Direct engagement**: Search `"[candidate name]" "Alan Hirsch"` and `"[candidate name]" "Forgotten Ways" OR "5Q" OR "APEST"`
2. **Network**: Search `"[candidate name]" Forge OR 100Movements OR 5Q OR Exponential OR Missio Alliance`
3. **Concepts**: Search `"[candidate name]" incarnational OR missional OR multiplication OR centered set`
4. **Content sample**: Pull 2–3 representative articles, bios, or book descriptions for Category C–E

### Phase 3: Scoring

1. Score each category using the rubric tables.
2. Sum for total (0–100).
3. Record evidence source (URL or snippet) for each score.

### Phase 4: Ranking and Classification

| Score Band | Label | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 85–100 | **Core** | Inner circle; co-authors, org leaders, primary articulators of Hirsch’s frameworks |
| 65–84 | **High Affinity** | Strong conceptual and/or network alignment; likely cite and teach Hirsch |
| 45–64 | **Moderate Affinity** | Meaningful overlap; missional/movement language; some network proximity |
| 25–44 | **Low Affinity** | Partial overlap; tangential to Hirsch’s space |
| 0–24 | **Minimal / No Affinity** | Little discernible connection |

## Agent Instructions

When using this rubric via an AI agent:

1. **Prefer observable evidence**—cite URLs, snippets, or search results for each score.
2. **Flag uncertainty**—if evidence is thin, note “low confidence” and the missing evidence type.
3. **Do not assume**—no points for concepts not found in searchable content.
4. **Cross-check**—if a candidate scores high on C–E but 0 on A–B, consider “hidden affinity” and validate with extra searches.
5. **Update benchmarks**—as new candidates are scored, add representative examples to the benchmark table.

*This rubric is designed for search-based, agentic assessment of Hirsch affinity without requiring access to Hirsch’s books. It complements the general Movemental thought leader rubric in `tam-search/03-RUBRIC.md`, which measures platform readiness and movemental DNA across domains.*
