- Research limited to publicly available information
- Searches conducted using name "Alan McWilliam" with Christian ministry context terms
- No alternative name variations or spellings identified
- No geographic context provided for targeted searches

2. **Private/Protected Content**: Content may exist but be behind privacy settings or paywalls
3. **Name Variation**: Individual may use different name online
4. **Regional/Local Presence**: May have local presence not captured in broad searches
5. **Emerging Presence**: May be building digital presence but not yet discoverable

## Non-Matches Excluded

The following individuals named "Alan McWilliam" or "Allan McWilliam" were found but excluded as they do not align with Movemental's target audience:

2. **Alan McWilliam** - Financial planner (Advice for Life Financial Planning)
3. **Dr. Allan McWilliam** - Quantum physics researcher (University of Strathclyde)

These individuals have digital presences in their respective fields, but none relate to Christian ministry or movement leadership.

**Recommendation**: Additional identifying information needed to proceed with accurate digital presence discovery, or document current findings as baseline for future research.
