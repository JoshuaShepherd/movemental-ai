## Alternative Scenarios

If "Alan McWilliam" exists as a Christian movement leader but was not discovered:

### Potential Gaps (Hypothetical)
- If embodied work exists but is not digitally represented:
  - Sermons/talks not transcribed or published
  - Teaching not captured in articles or courses
  - Ideas not developed in digital formats
  - Content scattered across platforms
  - Limited discoverability

- If digital content exists but is not connected:
  - Isolated content pieces
  - No content ecosystem
  - Limited cross-referencing
  - Fragmented platform presence

### Potential Opportunities (Hypothetical)
- Content repurposing (sermons → articles, teaching → courses)
- Content expansion (series, themes, topics)
- Ecosystem building (connecting isolated content)
- Discovery improvements (SEO, network effects)
- Content form development (missing forms)

## Conclusion

**No gap analysis possible** - No embodied work or digital expression discovered for "Alan McWilliam" in Christian ministry, missional church, or movement leadership contexts.

**Recommendation**: Additional identifying information needed to locate work and perform gap analysis, or document current findings as baseline for future research when work becomes available.
