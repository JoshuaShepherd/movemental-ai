## Core Frameworks & Concepts

### mDNA (Missional DNA)

**Definition**: Six essential elements that together define the character of apostolic movements, introduced in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006).

**The Six Elements:**
1. **Jesus is Lord** - The organizing center (gates all other elements)
2. **Disciple Making** - The strategic nerve of multiplication
3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Living among non-believers
4. **Apostolic Environment (APEST)** - Fivefold ministry activation
5. **Organic Systems** - Simple, reproducible patterns
6. **Liminality-Communitas** - Growth through shared hardship

**Key Principle**: "Jesus is Lord" gates overall maturity—no Level 5 overall if Lordship is below Level 3. The elements are systemically interdependent; each contains seeds of the others.

### APEST Model (5Q)

**Definition**: Five-fold ministry gifts from Ephesians 4:11—Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds, Teachers—as spiritual giftings and intelligence to be activated in the church.

**Purpose**: Diagnostic tool for identifying ministry gifting, building functional leadership teams, and creating mission diversity in church communities.

**Related Resources**: *5Q: Reactivating the Original Intelligence and Capacity of the Body of Christ* (2017), *Activating 5Q: A User's Guide* (2018)

### Incarnational Mission

**Definition**: Mission embedded in daily life, in place, relational—rather than programmatic or institutional models. Emphasis on "living among" rather than "reaching out to."

**Key Characteristics**: Contextual, relational, everyday, embedded, authentic presence

### Movement vs. Institution

**Core Distinction**: Hirsch's work repeatedly seeks to shift paradigm from "church as institution" to "church as movement." Movemental thinking emphasizes organic growth, multiplication, and apostolic energy over maintenance, programs, and institutional preservation.
