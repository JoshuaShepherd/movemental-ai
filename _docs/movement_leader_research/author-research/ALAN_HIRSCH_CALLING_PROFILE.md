## Calling Statement

### Synthesized Calling

Alan Hirsch is called to **reanimate authentic transformative missional movements** by restoring the essential DNA of apostolic movements in Western church contexts. His vocation is not to refine church practice but to catalyze paradigm shifts from "church as institution" to "church as movement." Through frameworks (mDNA, APEST), training (Forge, Future Travelers, 100Movements), and equipping (books, courses, assessments), he empowers others to lead missional transformation. His calling integrates deep theology with practical application, bridges academic rigor with grassroots practice, and centers on Jesus as Lord as the organizing principle for all movement. He is a movement catalyst, framework builder, and equipper of leaders—called to restore what has been forgotten and activate what has been dormant.
