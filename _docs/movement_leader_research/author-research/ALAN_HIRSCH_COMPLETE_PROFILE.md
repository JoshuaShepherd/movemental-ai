## 2. Early Life and Background

### Birth and Family
[NEEDS RESEARCH] - Birth date, place of birth, family background

### Jewish Heritage
Alan Hirsch grew up in a Jewish family in apartheid South Africa. While he describes himself as "not an observant Jew by any stretch of the imagination," his Jewish heritage and background have significantly influenced his perspective and theological thinking.

**Source**: *Untamed* (00-intro.mdx): "I (Alan) grew up in a Jewish family and was born and raised in apartheid South Africa until age twenty-two."

### South African Context
- Born and raised in South Africa during apartheid
- Lived there until age 22
- Experienced the political and social dynamics of apartheid firsthand
- Developed early awareness of social justice issues

### Early Political Awareness
At age 13, Alan became politically active against apartheid. He describes having "a seemingly natural affinity with black people" and deciding early on that apartheid was "profoundly wrong and morally reprehensible."

**Source**: *Untamed* (00-intro.mdx): "Having a seemingly natural affinity with black people, I became politically active against apartheid as early as age thirteen. Nothing too hotheaded, but I had already decided that apartheid was profoundly wrong and morally reprehensible."

### Early Spiritual Awareness
Even as a young boy, Alan experienced moments of ecstatic worship and never doubted God's existence. He had what he describes as "an illicit fascination with Jesus" as a young Jewish teenager.

**Source**: *Untamed* (00-intro.mdx): "I can honestly say I don't remember a time when I ever doubted God's existence, and I can remember moments of ecstatic worship, even as a very young boy, where God seemed more real to me than my own self. My journey to explicit Christian faith started early, with what seemed to a young Jewish teenager as an illicit fascination with Jesus."

**Key Quote**: "For me, coming to Jesus was coming home in every way. I had an overwhelming encounter with God and was totally and absolutely won over. It was the defining moment of my life: I gave my life fully to Jesus and I have never looked back."
