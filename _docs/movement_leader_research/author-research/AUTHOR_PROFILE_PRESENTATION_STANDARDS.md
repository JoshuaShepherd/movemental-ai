# Author Profile Presentation Standards

> **Visual, Interpretational, Concise Author Intelligence** - Presentation standards and agent executable prompt for creating author profiles that prioritize insight over information, visual clarity over prose, and strategic interpretation over raw data.

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: January 17, 2026  
**Purpose**: Defines presentation format for author profiles that are scannable, actionable, and visually engaging while maintaining programmatic access for tool integration.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Author profiles should be:**

1. **Interpretational First** - Lead with strategic insights, not raw data
2. **Visual & Scannable** - Use visual elements (tables, scorecards, indicators) for quick comprehension
3. **Concise & Actionable** - Every element serves a strategic purpose
4. **Programmatically Accessible** - Structured data remains extractable for tool integration

**Word Count Philosophy**: Instead of fixed word counts, aim for optimal information density:
- **40% Visual/Structured** (tables, scorecards, matrices)
- **60% Interpretive Prose** (strategic insights, implications)
- **Total Target**: 1,000-1,300 words, but density matters more than count

---

## Profile Structure Template

Every author profile (Author, Audience, Content Audit, Calling) follows this structure:

### 1. **At-A-Glance Scorecard** (Visual Dashboard)
- Quick visual summary of key metrics
- Status indicators (✅ ⚠️ ❌)
- Score/percentage where applicable
- Positioned at the very top for immediate comprehension

### 2. **Strategic Insight** (Interpretative Positioning)
- 2-3 paragraphs of strategic interpretation
- What makes this author unique/distinctive?
- Why this matters strategically
- What this means for content strategy

### 3. **Visual Summary** (Tables, Matrices, Indicators)
- Key data presented in scannable visual format
- Use tables, progress bars, comparison matrices
- Reduce prose, increase visual information density

### 4. **Deep Dive** (Supporting Evidence)
- Detailed sections with supporting data
- Maintains structured format but provides depth
- Supports the strategic insights above

### 5. **Actionable Implications** (Quick Reference)
- Clear, actionable takeaways
- Visual boxes or tables for quick reference
- Directly connects to content strategy

---

## Visual Elements & Standards

### Scorecards & Dashboards

Use markdown tables with visual indicators for metrics:

```markdown
## Profile At-A-Glance

| Dimension | Score | Status | Key Insight |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Biographical Completeness** | 95% | ✅ Complete | Strong foundation documented |
| **Framework Mastery** | 90% | ✅ Strong | Core frameworks well-established |
| **Digital Presence** | 75% | ⚠️ Moderate | Opportunity for expansion |
| **Voice Distinctiveness** | 85% | ✅ Strong | Clear voice patterns identified |

**Primary Positioning**: [One-sentence strategic position]
**Core Differentiator**: [What makes this author unique]
**Strategic Advantage**: [Why this matters for content strategy]
```

### Progress Bars & Alignment Indicators

Use visual progress bars for alignment scores, maturity levels, and percentages:

```markdown
## mDNA Alignment Profile

| Element | Alignment | Visual | Level |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Jesus is Lord** | 90% | ══════════░ | Very High |
| **Disciple Making** | 80% | ═════════░░ | High |
| **Missional-Incarnational** | 85% | ══════════░ | Very High |
| **Apostolic Environment** | 75% | ═════════░░ | High |
| **Organic Systems** | 70% | ════════░░░ | High |
| **Liminality-Communitas** | 60% | ═══════░░░░ | Medium |

**Overall mDNA Maturity**: Level 4 (Movement Catalyst)  
**Primary Strength**: [Element name]  
**Growth Opportunity**: [Element name]
```

### Status Indicators

Use consistent emoji/icons for quick visual scanning:

- ✅ **Complete/Strong** - Well-documented, strong evidence
- ⚠️ **Moderate/Partial** - Adequate but room for growth
- ❌ **Missing/Low** - Significant gap or weakness
- ⭐ **High Performance** - Top-performing content/capability
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently developing
- 💡 **Opportunity** - Strategic opportunity identified

### Content Inventory Matrices

Use scannable tables instead of prose lists:

```markdown
## Content Portfolio Overview

**Quick Wins**: [Top 3 repurposing opportunities]  
**Major Gaps**: [Top 3 content gaps]  
**High-Value Opportunities**: [Top 3 strategic opportunities]
```

### Audience Persona Boxes

Use visual boxes for audience segments:

```markdown

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Biographical Section

**❌ Before (Dense Prose)**:
```markdown
## Biographical Profile

Alan Hirsch was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and grew up in a Jewish 
family during apartheid. He became politically active against apartheid at age 
13, recognizing it as morally reprehensible. After mandatory military service 
in South Africa (age 20-22), where he was first introduced to drugs and then 
to Jesus, he attended university in Cape Town. He converted to Christianity 
around age 20 when one of his "drug buddies" was born again and began sharing 
the gospel with him. He immigrated to Australia in 1983 at age 22, shortly 
after meeting his wife Debra Hirsch.
```

**✅ After (Visual, Interpretational)**:
```markdown
## Strategic Positioning: The Movement Catalyst

**Position**: Alan Hirsch uniquely bridges academic theology with grassroots 
movement practice, translating deep missiological frameworks into accessible, 
practical tools for church transformation.

**Why This Matters**: His journey from apartheid South Africa through inner-city 
ministry to global movement leadership creates a unique voice that combines 
theoretical rigor with street-level credibility—enabling him to speak with 
authority to both seminary classrooms and church planters in the field.

---

### Biographical Foundation

| Milestone | Age/Year | Strategic Significance |
|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| Born (Johannesburg, SA) | [Date] | Shaped by justice context |
| Political activism begins | 13 | Early justice awareness |
| Military service → Conversion | ~20 | Personal transformation |
| University (Cape Town) | ~20-22 | Academic foundation |
| Immigration (Australia) | 1983 | Global perspective shift |

**Key Influences**: 
- Jewish heritage → Unique theological perspective
- Apartheid context → Justice-oriented mission
- Inner-city ministry (15 years) → Practical credibility
```

### Example 2: Framework Alignment

**❌ Before (Dense List)**:
```markdown
## mDNA Alignment Profile

### Element 1: Jesus is Lord
Alignment Strength: Very High. Evidence includes the book ReJesus from 2008 
which is entirely dedicated to Christology as defining for movements. There is 
consistent emphasis across all works that "Jesus is Lord" is foundational. 
The mDNA framework explicitly gates overall maturity by Lordship level. All 
frameworks center on Jesus as organizing principle. Content alignment is strong 
with ReJesus, mDNA framework emphasis, and consistent theological foundation. 
There is an opportunity for more content on practical application of Lordship 
in daily life and leadership.
```

**✅ After (Visual, Scannable)**:
```markdown
## mDNA Alignment Profile

| Element | Alignment | Visual | Evidence Summary |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Jesus is Lord** | 90% | ══════════░ | *ReJesus* (2008), foundational emphasis |
| **Disciple Making** | 80% | ═════════░░ | Multiple books, practical focus |
| **Missional-Incarnational** | 85% | ══════════░ | Core framework, lived experience |
| **Apostolic Environment** | 85% | ══════════░ | APEST/5Q developer, high engagement |
| **Organic Systems** | 75% | ═════════░░ | Framework emphasis, moderate practice |
| **Liminality-Communitas** | 60% | ═══════░░░░ | Theoretical understanding, limited content |

**Overall mDNA Maturity**: Level 4.5 (Movement Catalyst)  
**Primary Strength**: Apostolic vision with Christocentric foundation  
**Growth Opportunity**: More content on practical application of Lordship in leadership

**Strategic Insight**: Hirsch's mDNA alignment reveals a framework builder whose 
theoretical depth creates tools others can implement—positioning him as both 
architect (building frameworks) and catalyst (equipping others to use them).
```

### Example 3: Content Inventory

**❌ Before (Long List)**:
```markdown
