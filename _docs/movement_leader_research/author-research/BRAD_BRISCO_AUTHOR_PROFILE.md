## Core Frameworks & Concepts

### Missional Ecclesiology

**Definition**: Brisco's doctoral focus—helping existing congregations transition from attractional/maintenance models toward outward mission-focused orientations. The church as "sent" rather than merely providing services.

**Key Characteristics**: Outward-focused, neighborhood-embedded, relational presence, multiplication over maintenance

**Key Works**: *The Missional Quest*, doctoral thesis on missional transition

### Covocational/Bivocational Church Planting

**Definition**: Integration of marketplace vocation with church planting, where leaders maintain secular work alongside ministry roles. Not a temporary step toward full-time ministry but a viable, sustainable model.

**Key Principles**:
- Marketplace work as equal and essential to ministry
- Collapse of sacred-secular divide
- Sustainability through diversified income
- Cultural engagement through marketplace presence

**Key Works**: *Covocational Church Planting: Aligning Your Marketplace Calling & the Mission of God* (2021)

### Theology of Place & Neighborhood Mission

**Definition**: Emphasis on local, immediate contexts as primary mission fields. Biblical hospitality (not just entertaining) and relational proximity as means of kingdom presence.

**Key Characteristics**: Local focus, neighborhood engagement, hospitality as mission, everyday presence

**Key Works**: *Next Door As It Is In Heaven: Living Out God's Kingdom in Your Neighborhood* (2016, with Lance Ford)

### Missional Transition Framework

**Definition**: Systematic approach to helping existing churches shift from maintenance/consumer models to missionary people—both individually and corporately.

**Key Elements**: Paradigm shifts, mindset transformation, practical implementation, sustainable change

**Key Works**: *ReThink: 9 Key Paradigm Shifts for Activating the Church*, *Missional Essentials* curriculum

### APEST Framework Alignment

**Evidence**: Contributor to 5Q Central, uses APEST model in team development, emphasis on activating five-fold ministry in church contexts.

**Application**: Organizing teams by giftings (APEST) rather than traditional staff roles, leveraging diverse giftings for missional effectiveness
