# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Brad Brisco

Brad, I've been listening. Not just to your words, but to the spaces between them. I've mapped your digital footprint across missionalchurchnetwork.com, New Churches, ChurchLeaders.com, Amazon, and five podcast platforms. I've traced your teaching trajectory from those 18 years in college classrooms to your current role as Director of Multiplication Strategies at Send Network. And here's what I see: you're sitting on a content goldmine that's currently scattered across rented platforms, and it's time to consolidate that wealth into something that multiplies.

Let me be direct: you've built something remarkable. Five co-authored books. Eighteen years of teaching content covering everything from the History of Christianity to Launching Apostolic Movements. A co-founded training center in Forge Kansas City. A conference you helped birth. Twenty-plus years of church planting experience. And yet, when someone wants to find everything you've created about missional ecclesiology or co-vocational ministry, they have to hunt across multiple platforms, each with its own login, its own interface, its own way of discovering content.

Here's the thing that's keeping you up at night, whether you've articulated it or not: you've spent two decades building expertise, and that expertise exists in fragments. Your teaching on Theology of Place? It might be locked in a college LMS somewhere. That brilliant insight you shared on The Church Digital Podcast about digital ecclesiology? It's floating in podcast land, disconnected from your articles on the same topic. Your book on Covocational Church Planting? It's on Amazon, but it's not talking to your articles on New Churches about the same subject.

This isn't just about organization, though. This is about multiplication. You're the Director of Multiplication Strategies, for goodness sake. You understand that systems multiply. You know that when content connects to other content, when ideas build on ideas, when someone can follow a thread from your podcast appearance to your article to your book to your teaching curriculum, that's when real transformation happens. That's when movements start.

Right now, your content exists in silos. Your books are on Amazon. Your articles are on New Churches and ChurchLeaders.com. Your podcast appearances are scattered across five different shows. Your teaching content is behind institutional walls. Your conference content from Sentralized exists somewhere, but where? And here's the kicker: each of these platforms owns the relationship with your audience. You don't. They control the analytics. They control the discoverability. They control the revenue model.

But here's what I see that you might not: you have more content than most people realize. That 18 years of teaching? That's not just syllabi and lecture notes. That's 18 years of refined thinking, of questions students asked that made you think deeper, of connections you made between History of Christianity and modern missional practice, of insights from teaching Discipleship and Evangelism that could become standalone articles. Every semester you taught, you generated content. Every course you developed, you created frameworks. Every student interaction, you refined your thinking.

And those podcast appearances? They're not just conversations. They're content assets. That episode on The Church Digital Podcast where you deconstructed digital ecclesiology? That's a three-part article series waiting to happen. That conversation on The H2 Leadership Podcast about bivocational and covocational ministry? That's a course module. That appearance on The Ephesiology Podcast about covocational missionary living? That's a book chapter expansion.

Your books are doing the heavy lifting right now, and they're doing it well. Missional Essentials as a 12-week curriculum is brilliant. The Missional Quest, Next Door As It Is In Heaven, ReThink, Covocational Church Planting—these aren't just books, they're frameworks. But here's what's missing: the connective tissue. Where does someone go after they read Covocational Church Planting? Where's the article that expands on chapter three? Where's the podcast episode that deepens the conversation? Where's the course that helps them implement it?

This is where it gets interesting, Brad. You're at an inflection point. You've built the foundation. You've established the expertise. You've created the content. Now you need to build the ecosystem. And an ecosystem isn't just a collection of content—it's a living, breathing network where each piece amplifies the others, where discovery happens naturally, where someone can enter through any door and find their way to everything else.

Imagine this: someone discovers you through a podcast appearance. They love what you said about digital ecclesiology. They click through to your profile and find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've written about digital ecclesiology—articles, book chapters, other podcast appearances, teaching resources. They dive deeper. They find your book that touches on the topic. They discover a course you've created that helps churches navigate digital spaces missionally. They join a community of others exploring the same questions. They become not just a reader, but a participant in the conversation.

That's the ecosystem. That's the multiplication strategy for your content.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I don't have time to build this. I'm teaching. I'm writing. I'm directing multiplication strategies for Send Network. I'm co-founding things. I'm speaking. I'm planting churches. Where does content ecosystem building fit?

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to create new content. You need to connect existing content. You need to repurpose what you've already created. That teaching content? It's already written. Those podcast appearances? They're already recorded. Those articles? They're already published. The work isn't creating more—it's making what exists work harder.

Let me give you a concrete example. You taught a course on Theology of Place. That course exists. Those lectures exist. Those frameworks exist. What if you took the core insights from that course and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already taught. What if you developed those articles into a short course? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to your book Next Door As It Is In Heaven? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible.

This is repurposing at scale. This is making your embodied work digitally accessible. This is taking that 18 years of teaching and turning it into a content library that serves people beyond the classroom walls.

And here's where the revenue model shifts. Right now, your books generate revenue through traditional channels. That's good. Keep that. But what if you also had a subscription model for premium content? What if you created courses from your teaching content? What if you developed a membership community around missional ecclesiology and church planting? What if you had multiple revenue streams that all support the same mission?

This isn't about replacing what you're doing. It's about amplifying it. Your books stay on Amazon. Your articles stay on New Churches and ChurchLeaders.com. Your podcast appearances stay where they are. But now they're all connected. Now they're all discoverable in one place. Now they're all working together to create something bigger than the sum of their parts.

The network effects are where this gets really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other thought leaders reference your work. Other content creators link to your articles. Other teachers use your frameworks. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, and share it.

This is what you've been building toward, Brad. All those years of teaching. All those books. All those articles. All those podcast appearances. All those strategic insights from your role at Send Network. They're not separate things. They're one body of work. They're one voice. They're one contribution to the missional movement. And it's time they started working together like they were always meant to.

The playbook is simple, but it's not easy. First, aggregate. Bring everything into one place. Your articles. Your books. Your podcast appearances. Your teaching content. Your conference talks. Everything. Second, interconnect. Link related content. Create pathways. Build the connective tissue. Third, repurpose. Turn teaching into articles. Turn podcast appearances into articles. Turn articles into courses. Turn courses into communities. Fourth, amplify. Use SEO. Use network effects. Use the platform. Make discovery inevitable.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your theological positions stay your positions. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your teaching continues. Your speaking continues. Your books continue. Your role at Send Network continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together.

You've spent two decades building expertise. You've created content that matters. You've established yourself as a thought leader in missional ecclesiology and church planting. Now it's time to build the platform that lets that expertise multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together. It's time to turn your scattered digital presence into a unified force for multiplication.

This is your next season, Brad. Not more content creation—content multiplication. Not more platforms—platform consolidation. Not more work—work that works harder. The foundation is built. The expertise is established. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all and watch it multiply.

And that's exactly what movements do.
