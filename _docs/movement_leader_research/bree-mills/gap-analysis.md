# Gap Analysis: Bree Mills

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Status**: Cannot proceed - Prerequisites not met

## Research Limitation

Gap analysis cannot proceed because the prerequisite research phases have not been completed:
- Identity verification: No matching identity found
- Digital presence discovery: Cannot proceed without verified identity
- Content analysis: Cannot proceed without digital presence discovery

Gap analysis requires understanding both the individual's embodied work and their digital expression to identify gaps between the two.

## Required for Gap Analysis

To proceed with gap analysis, the following must be completed:

1. **Verified Identity**: Confirmed identity with professional roles and institutional affiliations
2. **Digital Presence Discovery**: Comprehensive digital presence inventory
3. **Content Analysis**: Understanding of existing content and themes
4. **Embodied Work Indicators**: Teaching/speaking engagements, ministry roles, publications, etc.

## Gap Analysis Process (When Prerequisites Met)

Once prerequisites are met, gap analysis will include:

### Embodied Work Indicators
- Teaching/speaking engagements (conferences, events)
- Pastoral/ministry roles
- Institutional affiliations
- Movement/network participation
- Book publications (print presence)
- Established reputation/recognition

### Digital Expression Analysis
- How much of embodied work is represented digitally
- Sermons/talks transcribed and published
- Insights from teaching captured in articles
- Digital extension of live teaching
- Ideas from books developed further online
- Continuity between different content forms

### Gap Identification
- What exists in embodied work but not digitally
- What digital content exists but isn't connected
- Opportunities for digital amplification
- Missing content forms
- Discoverability gaps

### Connection Gaps
- Content pieces isolated or connected
- Opportunities for content repurposing
- Series development opportunities
- Theme expansion opportunities

## Next Steps

1. Complete identity verification
2. Complete digital presence discovery
3. Complete content analysis
4. Proceed with gap analysis
5. Generate gap analysis findings
