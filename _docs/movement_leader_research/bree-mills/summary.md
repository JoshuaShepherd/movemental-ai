## Research Limitations

### Cannot Proceed With Remaining Phases

Because no matching identity was found, the following research phases cannot proceed:

1. **Digital Presence Discovery**: Requires verified identity
2. **Content Analysis**: Requires discovered digital presence
3. **Gap Analysis**: Requires completed content analysis
4. **Movemental-Specific Analysis**: Requires completed gap analysis
5. **Comprehensive Summary**: Requires all research phases

### Potential Scenarios

The research may not have found the correct individual due to:

1. **Name Spelling**: The individual may use a different spelling (e.g., "Brie Mills", "Bre Mills", "Bree Mill")
2. **Different Name**: The individual may use a different name professionally
3. **Limited Digital Presence**: The individual may have minimal or no publicly searchable digital presence
4. **Private Profile**: The individual may maintain a private profile with limited public information
5. **Additional Context Needed**: Additional identifying information may be required to locate the correct individual

## Recommendations

To proceed with Digital Reality research, the following information would be helpful:

1. **Verify Name Spelling**: Confirm the exact spelling of the name
2. **Provide Additional Context**: 
   - Location/geographic context
   - Institutional affiliations (churches, organizations, seminaries)
   - Published works or publications
   - Ministry or organizational roles
   - Alternative names or professional names
3. **Alternative Search Strategy**: If name is confirmed, consider:
   - Searching for associated organizations or institutions
   - Searching for published works or content titles
   - Searching for conference or event appearances

## Next Steps

1. **User Verification**: Confirm correct name and spelling
2. **Additional Information**: Request additional identifying details if available
3. **Re-attempt Identity Verification**: With additional context or verified name
4. **Proceed with Research**: Once identity is verified, continue with Digital Reality research phases
