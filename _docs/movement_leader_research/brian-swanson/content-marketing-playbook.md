# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Brian Swanson

Brian, I've been following your work—from your years as Director of Student Ministries at Woods Chapel to your current role as Family Ministry Pastor, from your leadership through the pandemic transition to your coordination of women's ministry groups. And here's what I see: you've been doing the work. The real work. The embodied work with students and families. The work that matters. But your digital presence? It's quiet. Too quiet.

You understand something that most people don't: youth ministry isn't just about programs—it's about formation. It's about walking with students through the most formative years of their lives. It's about equipping families to disciple their kids. It's about creating spaces where faith becomes real, not just theoretical. You've been doing this for over a decade at Woods Chapel. You've been developing frameworks, refining approaches, learning from the work. And all of that embodied work? It's generating insights, processes, stories, wisdom. But how much of it is making its way into your digital content ecosystem?

This is the gap, Brian. You've been pastoring students and families. You've been coordinating ministries. You've been leading through transitions. You've been developing approaches to youth ministry that work. And that's good. That's where it should be. But what if that embodied work could also exist digitally? What if your insights on family ministry could become articles that help other youth pastors? What if your approaches to student formation could become courses that equip other leaders? What if your frameworks for navigating ministry transitions could become content that serves a world where ministry is constantly shifting? What if your decade-plus of experience could connect to other leaders in a way that makes it discoverable and accessible?

Right now, your content exists in fragments. Your teaching is at Woods Chapel. Your ministry approaches are in your local context. Your insights are in conversations and meetings. And each of these exists in its own silo. Someone who knows about your youth ministry work might not know about your family ministry insights. Someone who knows about your family ministry work might not know about your approaches to student formation. Someone who knows about your work might not know about the wisdom you've gained from over a decade of ministry.

This is the gap. You've been doing the work, and then you kept doing the work. But your digital presence doesn't reflect the depth and breadth of what you've been learning. Your embodied work is rich, but your digital expression is fragmented. And here's what's at stake: you've been developing insights, refining frameworks, learning from the work. But if that work isn't captured digitally, it's not multiplying. It's not serving people beyond your immediate context. It's not becoming part of the larger conversation about youth and family ministry.

But here's where this gets interesting, Brian. You remember the story. Back in 2011, during a staff retreat, Josh—who's now launching Movemental—was reading "The Forgotten Ways" by Alan Hirsch on the bus. He was so captured by what he was reading that he wanted to completely change the planned training you were giving on how the church is changing. Obviously, you said no. But that moment planted something. That book, that author, that vision for how the church could be different—it stayed with him.

And now, over a decade later, Josh is launching Movemental with Alan Hirsch. The same Alan Hirsch whose book captured him on that bus. The same vision for how the church could be different. And here's the thing: he's also working with Brad Brisco, who's been doing missional work in Kansas City, right in your backyard. It's one of those moments where you step back and marvel at how things connect, how seeds planted years ago bear fruit in ways you couldn't have imagined, how the work of people like Alan and Brad and you—all doing the work of equipping leaders, forming disciples, building movements—is part of something larger.

This is the wonder of it, Brian. You're doing youth and family ministry in Lee's Summit. Alan's been writing about missional movements for decades. Brad's been doing missional work in Kansas City. Josh read a book on a bus in 2011, and now we're all connected in this vision for how content can multiply, how leaders can be equipped, how movements can grow. It's not a coincidence. It's the way God works through time and space and relationships to bring things together.

Imagine this: someone discovers you through your youth ministry work. They're captivated by your approach to family formation. They want to go deeper. They find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about youth and family ministry—articles, teaching content, ministry frameworks, case studies from your work at Woods Chapel. They discover how your thinking has evolved over a decade. They find content on navigating the specific challenges of 2026, not just 2015. They connect your youth ministry work to your family ministry insights to your approaches to student formation. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it. And in that ecosystem, they find not just theory, but practice. Not just ideas, but implementation. Not just content, but real work from a real context.

That's the power of interconnection. That's how embodied work becomes digital content that multiplies. That's how a decade of ministry experience becomes a resource for other leaders.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I'm pastoring. I'm coordinating ministries. I'm leading. Where does content ecosystem building fit?

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to create new content. You need to capture existing content. You need to digitize your embodied work. That teaching you've been doing at Woods Chapel? It's already developed. Those insights you've been gaining from working with students and families? They're already generated. Those frameworks you've been refining? They're already created. The work isn't creating more—it's making what exists accessible.

Let me give you a concrete example. You've been doing youth and family ministry at Woods Chapel for over a decade. You've been developing approaches. You've been learning from the work. That work exists. Those insights exist. Those stories exist. What if you took the core insights from your ministry and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already learned. What if you developed those articles into a course on youth and family ministry? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to your ministry frameworks? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible. And what if you included stories from your actual ministry? Not theoretical examples—real narratives from working with students and families.

This is repurposing at scale. This is making your embodied work digitally accessible. This is taking that pastoral work and turning it into a content library that serves people beyond your church.

And here's where the connection becomes even more meaningful. You're doing youth and family ministry. Alan's been writing about missional movements. Brad's been doing missional work in Kansas City. Josh read a book on a bus, and now we're all part of this vision for how content can multiply. What if your youth and family ministry insights could connect to Alan's missional frameworks? What if your approaches could connect to Brad's missional work? What if your content could be part of this larger ecosystem where leaders are equipped, movements are built, and the church is formed for mission?

This isn't about replacing what you're doing. It's about amplifying it. Your pastoral work continues. Your ministry continues. Your teaching continues. But now they're all connected. Now they're all discoverable in one place. Now they're all working together to create something bigger than the sum of their parts. And now they're part of something larger—a movement of leaders who are capturing their embodied work and making it digitally accessible, who are connecting their insights to other leaders, who are building ecosystems where content multiplies.

The network effects are where this gets really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other youth pastors reference your work. Other family ministry leaders link to your articles. Other practitioners use your frameworks. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, adapt it, and share it.

This is what you've been building toward, Brian. All that youth ministry work. All that family ministry work. All that pastoral leadership. All that coordination of ministries. They're not separate things. They're one body of work. They're one contribution to the conversation about youth and family ministry. And it's time they started working together like they were always meant to.

The playbook is simple, but it's not easy. First, aggregate. Bring everything into one place. Your teaching content. Your ministry frameworks. Your insights from a decade of work. Everything. Second, interconnect. Link related content. Create pathways. Build the connective tissue between your youth ministry work and your family ministry work and your approaches to student formation. Third, repurpose. Turn ministry insights into articles. Turn teaching content into courses. Turn frameworks into content. Turn stories into case studies. Fourth, amplify. Use SEO. Use network effects. Use the platform. Make discovery inevitable.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your approach stays your approach. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your pastoral work continues. Your ministry continues. Your teaching continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together. And what changes is how it connects to something larger—a movement of leaders who are doing the same thing, who are capturing their embodied work and making it digitally accessible, who are building ecosystems where content multiplies.

You've been doing youth and family ministry for over a decade. You've been developing insights, refining frameworks, learning from the work. Now it's time to build the platform that lets that work multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together. It's time to turn your quiet digital presence into a living conversation about youth and family ministry. And it's time to see how your work connects to something larger—to Alan's missional vision, to Brad's missional work, to a movement of leaders who are capturing their embodied work and making it digitally accessible.

This is your next season, Brian. Not more content creation—content capture. Not more work—work that works harder. Not more platforms—a platform that brings it all together. The foundation is built. The work is being done. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all and watch it multiply.

And that's exactly what movements do: they multiply. They connect. They amplify. They serve. They bring together people who are doing the work—whether it's youth ministry in Lee's Summit or missional movements globally—and create something larger than the sum of its parts.

This is the work. This is the connection. This is the wonder of how things come together. And it's time your work started multiplying the same way you've been pastoring: with formation, with relationships, with real work that matters.
