- Opportunities for theme expansion
- Opportunities for content interconnection

## Research Gaps

### Significant Information Gaps

1. **Content Discovery**: Very little actual content discovered
2. **Platform Discovery**: Very few platforms discovered
3. **Volume Assessment**: Cannot assess content volume
4. **Content Analysis**: Cannot analyze actual content themes, style, organization
5. **Digital Expression**: Cannot assess how embodied work is represented digitally

### Limitations of This Analysis

- Analysis based primarily on roles and affiliations, not actual content
- Cannot verify what content actually exists
- Cannot compare embodied work to digital expression without discovering digital content
- Significant gaps in information limit comprehensive gap analysis

## Research Recommendations

To complete comprehensive gap analysis, the following would need to be discovered:

1. **Content Discovery**: Sermons, teaching, training materials, articles, books, conference talks
2. **Platform Discovery**: All websites, social media, video platforms, audio platforms
3. **Content Access**: Ability to review actual content to identify gaps
4. **Volume Assessment**: Quantification of embodied work vs. digital expression
5. **Connection Analysis**: Assessment of content interconnection and repurposing opportunities

## Summary

Darryl Answer's embodied work includes co-pastoring a network-based church (New Community Church), providing consulting and training through Verge Solutions LLC, and speaking at Exponential Conference. However, very little digital expression of this work was discovered through standard searches. This suggests either:

1. **Significant Digital Gap**: Embodied work exists but is not well represented digitally, OR
2. **Discovery Limitations**: Digital content exists but is not easily discoverable through standard search methods

Comprehensive gap analysis requires discovery of actual digital content to compare against known embodied work. Current analysis is limited by lack of discovered digital presence.
