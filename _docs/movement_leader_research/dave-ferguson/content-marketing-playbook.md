# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Dave Ferguson

Dave, let me cut straight to it: you're an apostle, and apostles think exponentially. I've mapped your empire—from daveferguson.org to Community Christian Church to NewThing Network to Exponential Conference. I've traced your nine books from The Big Idea to Hero Maker to B.L.E.S.S. I've watched how you think: not addition, but multiplication. Not individual, but movement. Not one church, but networks of churches. Not one leader, but leaders who multiply leaders.

You get it. You understand that movements don't grow linearly—they multiply exponentially. You understand that the apostolic gift isn't about doing ministry yourself—it's about creating systems that multiply. You understand that the question isn't "How do I reach more people?" but "How do I create more people who reach people?" You understand that the goal isn't one big church but churches that plant churches that plant churches.

And here's what I see: you've been building multiplication systems in the physical world. Community Christian Church multiplies through multi-site. NewThing Network multiplies through church planting. Exponential Conference multiplies through equipping. Hero Maker multiplies through leadership development. B.L.E.S.S. multiplies through neighbor engagement. But your content? It's still thinking addition, not multiplication.

Right now, your content exists in fragments. Your books are on Amazon. Your blog is on daveferguson.org. Your sermons are on Community Christian Church's website. Your conference talks are on Exponential's platform. Your movement resources are on NewThing's site. And each of these platforms? They're silos. They don't multiply. They don't connect. They don't create exponential growth.

But here's what an apostle would see: what if your content could multiply the same way your churches multiply? What if your articles could connect to your books could connect to your talks could connect to your resources in a way that creates exponential discovery? What if instead of one person finding one piece of content, one person could find everything and then share it with others who find everything and share it with others?

This is exponential thinking applied to content. This is apostolic multiplication in the digital space. This is what Movemental is trying to create: not just a platform, but a multiplication system. Not just content organization, but content reproduction. Not just discovery, but exponential discovery.

You understand this intuitively because you're an apostle. You see systems. You see multiplication. You see how one thing connects to another to create something bigger. You see how networks amplify. You see how movements grow. And here's what I see: your content could work the same way.

Imagine this: someone reads Hero Maker. They're captivated by the five essential practices for multiplying leaders. They want to go deeper. They find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about leadership multiplication—articles, book chapters, conference talks, sermon series, movement resources. They discover a course you've created on implementing Hero Maker principles. They find a community of other leaders doing the same work. They connect your book to your conference talk to your blog post to your movement resource. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it. And then they share it. And the person they share it with finds everything. And that person shares it. And it multiplies.

That's exponential content. That's apostolic thinking applied to digital space. That's what Movemental is trying to create.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I'm already multiplying. I'm already creating systems. I'm already thinking exponentially. Why do I need another platform?

Here's why: your content isn't multiplying yet. Your books multiply through readers. Your churches multiply through planting. Your leaders multiply through development. But your content? It's still thinking addition. One book. One blog post. One talk. One resource. They don't connect. They don't amplify each other. They don't create exponential discovery.

What if your content could work like your churches? What if your articles could plant other articles? What if your courses could multiply through students who create their own courses? What if your frameworks could reproduce through practitioners who adapt them? What if your content ecosystem could multiply the same way your movement multiplies?

This is what Movemental enables: content multiplication. Not just content organization—content reproduction. Not just content discovery—exponential discovery. Not just content connection—content multiplication.

Let me give you a concrete example. You've given countless talks at Exponential about leadership multiplication. Those talks exist. Those frameworks exist. Those insights exist. What if you took those talks and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already spoken. What if you developed those articles into a course on leadership multiplication? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to Hero Maker? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible. And what if that course could be adapted by other leaders? Not just consumed, but reproduced? That's exponential thinking. That's apostolic multiplication.

This is repurposing at scale, but it's more than that. It's multiplication at scale. It's taking your embodied work and making it digitally reproducible. It's taking your frameworks and creating systems that multiply them. It's taking your content and building an ecosystem that amplifies it exponentially.

And here's where the network effects get really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other leaders reference your work. Other content creators link to your articles. Other practitioners use your frameworks. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, adapt it, and share it.

This is exponential growth. This is apostolic thinking. This is what you've been building in the physical world, and now it's possible in the digital world.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your frameworks stay your frameworks. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your books continue. Your churches continue. Your networks continue. Your conference continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together in a system that reproduces.

You've spent decades building multiplication systems. You've created frameworks that multiply. You've established yourself as an apostolic leader who thinks exponentially. Now it's time to build the platform that lets your content multiply the same way your churches multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together in a system that reproduces. It's time to turn your scattered digital presence into a unified force for exponential multiplication.

This is your next season, Dave. Not more content creation—content multiplication. Not more platforms—a platform that multiplies. Not more work—work that reproduces. The foundation is built. The frameworks are established. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all in a system that multiplies exponentially.

And that's exactly what apostles do: they create systems that multiply. They build frameworks that reproduce. They think exponentially, not additively. They see networks, not individuals. They see movements, not moments.

This is the work. This is the multiplication. This is the exponential thinking applied to content. And it's time your content started multiplying the same way your churches do.
