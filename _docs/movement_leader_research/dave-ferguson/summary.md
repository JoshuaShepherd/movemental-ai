## Gap Analysis

### Embodied Work vs. Digital Expression

**Well Represented Digitally**:
- Books (all 9+ available digitally)
- Personal brand (website, blog, social media)
- Institutional presence (church, movement, conference websites)

**Partially Represented**:
- Sermons/teaching (likely available but volume/accessibility to be assessed)
- Conference talks (likely available but discoverability to be assessed)
- Blog content (active but volume/themes to be assessed)

**Potential Gaps**:
- Content repurposing: Are sermons transcribed and published as articles?
- Content interconnection: Are content pieces clearly connected?
- Content series: Are themes developed into content series?
- Content discoverability: Is content easily searchable and organized?

### Primary Gaps Identified

1. **Content Repurposing**: Opportunities to repurpose sermons, talks, and teaching into articles and other forms
2. **Content Interconnection**: Opportunities to connect content pieces and create content journeys

4. **Discoverability**: Opportunities to improve content organization and searchability
5. **Platform Fragmentation**: Content scattered across multiple platforms without unified hub

### Opportunities for Digital Amplification

1. **Repurpose existing content** into multiple forms (sermons → articles, talks → content)
2. **Connect content pieces** to create content journeys
3. **Develop content series** around key themes (leadership, planting, missional living)
4. **Improve discoverability** through organization and optimization
5. **Create unified content hub** to organize content across platforms
