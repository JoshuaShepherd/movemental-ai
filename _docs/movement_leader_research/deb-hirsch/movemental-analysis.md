## Platform Gaps Assessment

### Current Platform Limitations

**Potential Limitations**:

2. **Platform Ownership**: Mix of owned (if personal website exists) and rented platforms (social media, publisher sites, organizational sites)
3. **Content Silos**: Books, speaking content, professional expertise, organizational work may exist in separate silos
4. **Discoverability**: Content may not be easily discoverable across platforms
