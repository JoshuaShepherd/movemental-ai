# Digital Reality Profile: Ed Love

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: High  
**Sources**: See sources.md

## Executive Summary

Dr. Ed Love serves as the Executive Director of Church Multiplication and Discipleship for The Wesleyan Church, a role to which he was elected in 2022. With a background in student ministry, church planting, and leadership development, Love holds a Master of Divinity from Asbury Theological Seminary and a Doctor of Ministry from George Fox Evangelical Seminary. He also serves as an adjunct professor at Wesley Seminary.

Love's digital presence is primarily institutional, with content appearing on denominational platforms (wesleyan.life, wesleyan.org). He has authored church multiplication resources and contributes content focused on church multiplication, discipleship, and leadership development. His role centers on mobilizing healthy, multiplying churches and ministries within the Wesleyan denomination.

The primary gap between Love's embodied work and digital expression appears to be the limited public-facing personal brand presence. While his institutional role provides significant platform and audience, there is opportunity for expanding personal content presence, cross-platform distribution, and content repurposing from his extensive teaching, training, and church planting experience.

### What Would Remain the Same

## What We Will NOT Do

- **Alter Relationships**: Existing relationships and networks remain intact
- **Require Migration**: Existing content remains as-is, choice in what to publish where
- **Conflict with Institution**: Movemental enables independent presence while maintaining institutional connection

## Research Limitations

- Some content may exist but not be discoverable through public search
- Institutional content may have different access requirements or member-only areas
- Social media presence not clearly identified in initial research
- Specific content volumes and formats require deeper investigation

## Next Steps
