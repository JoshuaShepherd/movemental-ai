# Gap Analysis: Geoff Maddock

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: Low - Identity Mismatch

## Research Context

**Note**: This research was conducted to analyze gaps between embodied work and digital expression for a Christian movement leader, author, pastor, or theologian named "Geoff Maddock" aligned with Movemental's target audience. The only individual found through comprehensive searches is **Geoff Maddock, a New Zealand musician and producer**, who does not align with Movemental's target audience.

## Identity Mismatch Notice

Gap analysis cannot be completed because the target individual (Christian movement leader) could not be identified. The only individual found is a musician, not a Christian movement leader.

## Gap Analysis (Cannot Proceed)

### Status: **TARGET INDIVIDUAL NOT IDENTIFIED**

Gap analysis cannot be completed because:

1. **Identity Verification Failed**: The only individual found (New Zealand musician) does not align with Movemental's target audience
2. **No Embodied Work Identified**: No Christian ministry, teaching, or movement work was identified
3. **No Digital Expression Identified**: No Christian ministry digital content was found
4. **Wrong Individual**: The found individual works in music industry, not Christian ministry

### What Would Be Analyzed (If Correct Individual Was Found)

For a Christian movement leader aligned with Movemental's target audience, gap analysis would examine:

1. **Embodied Work Indicators**
   - Teaching/speaking engagements (conferences, events)
   - Pastoral/ministry roles
   - Institutional affiliations
   - Movement/network participation
   - Book publications
   - Established reputation/recognition

2. **Digital Expression Analysis**
   - How much of embodied work is represented digitally
   - Are sermons/talks transcribed and published
   - Are insights from teaching captured in articles
   - Is there a digital extension of live teaching
   - Are ideas from books developed further online
   - Is there continuity between different content forms

3. **Gap Identification**
   - What exists in embodied work but not digitally
   - What digital content exists but isn't connected
   - What opportunities exist for digital amplification
   - What content forms are missing
   - What discoverability gaps exist

4. **Connection Gaps**
   - Are content pieces isolated or connected
   - Are there opportunities for content repurposing
   - Are there series that could be developed
   - Are there themes that could be expanded

## Research Limitations

1. **Identity Verification**: Unable to identify the correct individual
2. **No Embodied Work**: No Christian ministry work identified
3. **No Digital Expression**: No Christian ministry digital content found
4. **Wrong Individual**: Only found individual works in music (not relevant)

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Target Individual**: Confirm the correct person before gap analysis
2. **Provide Additional Context**: Request identifying information to locate correct individual
3. **Alternative Research**: Once correct individual is identified, conduct gap analysis with proper context

## Notes

- Gap analysis cannot proceed until the target individual is correctly identified
- The only individual found (musician) works in music industry, not Christian ministry
- No embodied Christian ministry work was identified
- No digital Christian ministry content was found
- All standard search methods returned the same individual (musician), who is not relevant to Movemental's target audience
- Further research requires identification of the correct individual with additional context
