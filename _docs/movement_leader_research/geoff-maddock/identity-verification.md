## Potential Issues

1. **Name Commonality**: "Geoff Maddock" may be a common name, and the correct individual may not be easily discoverable through standard web searches
2. **Limited Digital Presence**: The correct individual (if they exist) may have very limited digital presence
3. **Alternative Spelling**: Name may be spelled differently (e.g., "Geoffrey Maddock", "Jeff Maddock")
4. **Regional/Local Leader**: The correct individual may be a local or regional leader without significant online presence
5. **Privacy Settings**: The correct individual may have limited public online presence due to privacy preferences

## Confidence Assessment

**Confidence Level**: Low - Identity Mismatch

**Reasoning**:
- Only one individual found through comprehensive searches
- Found individual does not align with Movemental's target audience
- No evidence of Christian ministry, theological teaching, or movement leadership
- All search queries returned the same musician
- No conflicting information found (suggesting no other person with this name in relevant context)

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Name Spelling**: Confirm exact spelling of name (Geoff vs. Geoffrey)
2. **Request Additional Information**: Ask for:
   - Location/city
   - Church/organization affiliation
   - Published works or books
   - Any known websites or platforms
   - Alternative names or variations
3. **Alternative Search Strategy**: If additional information is provided, conduct more targeted searches
4. **Human Verification**: Require human confirmation that this is the correct person being researched

## Notes

- All searches consistently returned the same individual (New Zealand musician)
- No Christian ministry leader, author, pastor, or theologian named "Geoff Maddock" was found through standard search methods
- The found individual (musician) has significant online presence but is not relevant to Movemental's target audience
- Further research requires additional identifying information to locate the correct individual
