# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Kurt Rietema

Kurt, I've been tracking your work—from To Mend the World to your community development in the Argentine neighborhood, from your role at Youthfront to Street Psalms to Fuller Youth Institute, from your teaching at MidAmerica Nazarene and William Jewell to your work with Snack Shack KC and housing initiatives. And here's what I see: you're doing the work. The real work. The embodied work. The work that matters. But your content? It's scattered across organizational platforms, and you don't have a personal brand hub that captures what you're actually doing.

You understand something that most people don't: content isn't just what you write—it's what you do. Your community development work in the Argentine neighborhood? That's content. Your housing initiatives helping families transition from renting to homeownership? That's content. Your youth social entrepreneurship programs? That's content. Your teaching on practical theology and social entrepreneurship? That's content. Your border support work with Haitian migrants? That's content. Your church planting and Bible studies in the neighborhood? That's content.

But here's the thing: most of that content exists in the embodied world, not the digital world. It's happening in the Argentine neighborhood, in your classrooms, in your organizational work, in your community engagement. And that's good. That's where it should be. But what if that embodied work could also exist digitally? What if your community development insights could become articles that help other practitioners? What if your teaching content could become courses that equip other leaders? What if your housing initiatives could become case studies that inspire other communities? What if your book on mending the world could connect to all of this work in a way that makes it discoverable and accessible?

Right now, your content exists in fragments. Your book is on a publisher platform. Your organizational work is on Youthfront, Fuller Youth Institute, and Street Psalms websites. Your teaching is in college classrooms. Your community work is in the Argentine neighborhood. And each of these exists in its own silo. Someone who reads your book might not know about your community work. Someone who knows about your community work might not know about your teaching. Someone who knows about your teaching might not know about your organizational resources. And you? You don't have a personal brand hub that brings it all together.

This is the gap, Kurt. You're doing the work. You're creating the content. You're building the relationships. You're developing the insights. But your digital presence doesn't reflect the depth and breadth of what you're actually doing. Your embodied work is rich, but your digital expression is fragmented.

Here's what I see when I look at your work: you're integrating practical theology with social entrepreneurship. You're doing community development in under-resourced neighborhoods. You're working on immigration advocacy and housing equity. You're empowering youth through social entrepreneurship. You're teaching at multiple institutions. You're leading at multiple organizations. You're planting churches and building community. And all of this work? It's generating insights, frameworks, processes, case studies, stories. But how much of it is making its way into your digital content ecosystem?

This is where it gets strategic, Kurt. You're not just a content creator—you're a practitioner. You're not just writing about community development—you're doing it. You're not just teaching about social entrepreneurship—you're implementing it. You're not just talking about downward mobility—you're living it. And that embodied work? It's your greatest content asset. But it's not fully digitized. It's not fully discoverable. It's not fully connected.

Imagine this: someone reads To Mend the World. They're captivated by your vision for youth ministry that integrates practical theology with social entrepreneurship. They want to go deeper. They find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about youth ministry and social entrepreneurship—articles, book chapters, organizational resources, teaching materials, case studies from your community work. They discover a course you've created on implementing social entrepreneurship in youth ministry. They find case studies from Snack Shack KC. They connect your book to your teaching to your community work to your organizational resources. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it. And in that ecosystem, they find not just theory, but practice. Not just ideas, but implementation. Not just content, but real work.

That's the power of interconnection. That's how embodied work becomes digital content. That's how practice becomes accessible to other practitioners.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I'm already doing a lot. I'm teaching. I'm leading organizations. I'm doing community development. I'm planting churches. I'm working on housing initiatives. Where does content ecosystem building fit?

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to create new content. You need to capture existing content. You need to digitize your embodied work. That community development process you've been refining in the Argentine neighborhood? It's already developed. Those insights from your housing initiatives? They're already generated. Those frameworks from your teaching? They're already created. The work isn't creating more—it's making what exists accessible.

Let me give you a concrete example. You've been doing community development work in the Argentine neighborhood for years. That work exists. Those processes exist. Those insights exist. What if you took the core insights from that work and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already learned. What if you developed those articles into a course on community development in under-resourced neighborhoods? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to your book? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible. And what if you included case studies from your actual work? Not theoretical examples—real stories from the Argentine neighborhood.

This is repurposing at scale. This is making your embodied work digitally accessible. This is taking that community development work and turning it into a content library that serves people beyond your neighborhood.

And here's where the personal brand becomes important. Right now, your content exists on organizational platforms. That's good. Keep that. But what if you also had a personal brand hub? What if you had a space where all of your work—your book, your teaching, your community work, your organizational resources—could exist together? What if you had a platform that wasn't just about one organization or one role, but about the whole body of work you're building?

This isn't about replacing what you're doing. It's about amplifying it. Your book stays with the publisher. Your organizational work continues. Your teaching continues. Your community work continues. But now they're all connected. Now they're all discoverable in one place. Now they're all working together to create something bigger than the sum of their parts.

The network effects are where this gets really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other practitioners reference your work. Other community developers link to your articles. Other teachers use your frameworks. Other leaders adapt your case studies. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, adapt it, and share it.

This is what you've been building toward, Kurt. All that community work. All that teaching. All that organizational leadership. All that book writing. They're not separate things. They're one body of work. They're one contribution to the movement of mending the world. And it's time they started working together like they were always meant to.

The playbook is simple, but it's not easy. First, aggregate. Bring everything into one place. Your book. Your teaching content. Your community work insights. Your organizational resources. Everything. Second, interconnect. Link related content. Create pathways. Build the connective tissue between your book and your teaching and your community work and your organizational resources. Third, repurpose. Turn community development insights into articles. Turn teaching content into courses. Turn housing initiatives into case studies. Turn book concepts into expanded content. Fourth, amplify. Use SEO. Use network effects. Use the platform. Make discovery inevitable.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your work stays your work. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your book continues. Your teaching continues. Your organizations continue. Your community work continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together.

You've spent years building embodied work that matters. You've created content that serves real communities. You've established yourself as a practitioner who integrates theory and practice. Now it's time to build the platform that lets that work multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together. It's time to turn your scattered digital presence into a unified force for mending the world.

This is your next season, Kurt. Not more content creation—content capture. Not more work—work that works harder. Not more platforms—a platform that brings it all together. The foundation is built. The work is being done. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all and watch it multiply.

And that's exactly what mending the world requires: work that multiplies. Content that serves. Platforms that connect. Ecosystems that amplify.

This is the work. This is the integration. This is the digital expression of embodied practice. And it's time your work started multiplying the same way you're mending the world.
