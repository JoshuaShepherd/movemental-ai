## Research Limitations

1. **Web Search Tool Limitations**: The web search tool used returned process descriptions and general information rather than direct access to all platforms and content. Comprehensive platform exploration would require direct website visits.

2. **Initial Research Phase**: This represents initial discovery. Further investigation needed for:
   - Complete platform mapping
   - Content volume assessment
   - Detailed content analysis
   - Comprehensive source verification
   - Social media presence verification
   - Video/podcast content discovery
   - Blog content analysis
   - Personal website discovery

3. **Source Verification Needed**: Many sources referenced in search results need direct verification through:
   - Website visits
   - Platform exploration
   - Cross-referencing multiple sources
   - Direct content analysis

4. **Content Volume Assessment**: Initial research identified content forms and themes, but detailed volume assessment requires:
   - Direct platform exploration

   - Twitter/X profile

   - Instagram profile
   - YouTube channel(s)

6. **Personal Website**: Personal website not identified in initial research. May exist but not easily discoverable.
