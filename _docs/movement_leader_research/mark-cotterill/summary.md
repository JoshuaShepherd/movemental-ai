# Digital Reality Profile: Mark Cotterill

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: Medium (name ambiguity with British political figure)

## Executive Summary

Mark Cotterill is a coach, consultant, and 5Q (APEST) trainer working with 5Q Central, and co-founder of Venture 12 Network, a network focused on equipping and resourcing missional individuals and teams. He is also an active church planter with his wife Emma Cotterill, having pioneered new faith communities in the UK and Sweden. Cotterill's work focuses on 5Q (APEST) training and coaching, leadership development, team optimization, and missional movement through church planting and network building.

Cotterill's digital presence includes organizational affiliations with 5Q Central and Venture 12 Network, though comprehensive digital discovery was limited due to name ambiguity with Mark Adrian Cotterill (British far-right political figure, born 1960). Web searches primarily returned results for the political figure, making comprehensive research challenging. Information was primarily sourced from organizational references and Emma Cotterill's research, which confirmed Mark as her husband and church planting partner.

The content ecosystem shows strong thematic consistency around 5Q (APEST) framework, church planting, missional movement, leadership development, and network building, though opportunities exist for greater content interconnection, digital amplification of training/coaching expertise, and personal content hub development.

## Research Limitations and Notes

### Name Ambiguity Challenge

**Primary Limitation**: Web searches primarily return results for Mark Adrian Cotterill (British far-right political figure, born 1960) rather than the subject of this research. This creates significant challenges:

- Search result contamination (most queries return political figure)
- Limited publicly available information about Mark Cotterill (church planter/5Q Central)
- Information primarily sourced from organizational references and Emma Cotterill research
- Name ambiguity makes comprehensive web research challenging

### Research Limitations

- Organizational websites (5Q Central, Venture 12 Network) referenced but not directly accessed
- Personal website not discovered (may exist but not prominently indexed)
- Social media presence not verified (name ambiguity issue)
- Written content (articles, blog posts), video content, audio content not verified
- Detailed content cataloging not completed
- Many opportunities identified as "potential" due to limited information

### Information Sources

- References in Emma Cotterill's research (most reliable source - confirmed husband and church planting partner)
- Organizational references in search results (5Q Central, Venture 12 Network)
- Role descriptions and affiliations
- Limited direct information due to name ambiguity
