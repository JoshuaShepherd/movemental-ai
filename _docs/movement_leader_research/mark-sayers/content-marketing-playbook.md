# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Mark Sayers

Mark, I've been tracking your work—from Disappearing Church to Reappearing Church, from Platforms to Pillars to A Non-Anxious Presence to Strange Days. I've listened to Rebuilders. I've mapped your digital presence across marksayers.co, Moody Publishers, podcast platforms, conference stages, and your pastoral work at Red Church. And here's what I see: you're a cultural diagnostician who's been naming the hyper-real, and now there's a platform that's actually trying to do something about it.

You wrote about hyper-realism in The Trouble in Paris. You've been naming how we're living in a world where the simulation has replaced the real, where platforms have replaced pillars, where the digital has become more real than the embodied. You've been diagnosing the problem. And here's what's happening: while you've been naming the hyper-real, technology has been accelerating it. AI is generating content that looks real but isn't. Algorithms are curating experiences that feel personal but aren't. Platforms are creating communities that seem connected but aren't.

But here's the thing: what if there's a different way? What if instead of technology replacing the real, technology could amplify it? What if instead of AI generating fake content, AI could help real people connect their real work? What if instead of platforms fragmenting community, a platform could actually create the conditions for what Brian Eno called scenius—that collective intelligence that emerges when a group of people create together?

This is what Movemental is trying to do. Not technology for technology's sake. Not AI as a replacement for human creativity. But technology as a tool for human connection. AI as an amplifier of human intelligence. A platform that doesn't fragment community but creates the conditions for it. This isn't born from naive optimism about technology. It's born from wrestling with the same tensions you've been naming. It's a living model, not a finished product. And like any living model, it requires a community to make it real.

You understand this better than most. You've written about the gray zone—those transitional periods between eras where the old is dying but the new hasn't fully emerged. You've written about non-anxious presence—the ability to lead in uncertainty without being consumed by it. You've written about platforms versus pillars—the difference between seeking attention and building something that lasts. And here's what I see: Movemental exists in that gray zone. It's a non-anxious response to the hyper-real. It's trying to be a pillar, not just another platform.

But here's where it gets interesting for you, Mark. You've been creating content across multiple forms—books, podcast, speaking, pastoral teaching. You've been generating insights about culture, faith, leadership, renewal. You've been building a body of work that matters. But right now, that work exists in fragments. Your books are on Moody Publishers. Your podcast is on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Your speaking is captured on conference platforms. Your pastoral teaching is at Red Church. And each of these platforms? They're part of the hyper-real. They create the illusion of connection while actually fragmenting it. They give you analytics but not real community. They give you reach but not real relationship.

What if your content could exist in a different kind of space? Not a platform that fragments, but a platform that connects. Not a system that creates hyper-reality, but a system that amplifies the real. Not technology that replaces community, but technology that creates the conditions for scenius to emerge.

Imagine this: someone reads Strange Days. They're captivated by your analysis of the hyper-real. They want to go deeper. They find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about hyper-realism and cultural analysis—articles, book chapters, podcast episodes, conference talks, pastoral teaching. They discover a community of others wrestling with the same questions. They connect your book to your podcast to your speaking to your teaching. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it. And in that ecosystem, they find not just content, but conversation. Not just information, but formation. Not just a platform, but a pillar.

That's what Movemental is trying to create. A space where content connects to content, where people connect to people, where the real work of real people gets amplified instead of replaced. A space where AI doesn't generate fake content but helps real people discover real content. A space where technology serves community instead of fragmenting it.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I've been warning about the hyper-real. I've been naming how technology creates simulation. Why would I trust another platform? Why would I believe this is different?

Here's the difference: Movemental isn't trying to be the solution. It's trying to be a tool. It's not trying to replace your voice with AI. It's trying to amplify your voice with technology. It's not trying to create fake community. It's trying to connect real communities. It's not trying to generate content. It's trying to help you connect the content you've already created.

This is the work born of wrestling with tension. It's not naive. It's not utopian. It's realistic about what technology can and cannot do. It understands that platforms fragment. It understands that algorithms manipulate. It understands that AI can generate the hyper-real. But it's also trying to propose something different: technology that serves instead of replaces, platforms that connect instead of fragment, AI that amplifies instead of generates.

And like any living model, it requires a community. It requires people like you who understand the hyper-real and are trying to create something real. It requires people who've been naming the problem and are willing to experiment with solutions. It requires people who understand that scenius doesn't emerge from platforms that fragment, but from spaces that connect.

You've been creating content that matters. Your books have shaped conversations. Your podcast has equipped leaders. Your speaking has challenged assumptions. Your pastoral work has formed communities. But right now, that content exists in fragments. Your books don't talk to your podcast. Your podcast doesn't connect to your speaking. Your speaking doesn't reference your teaching. And each of these fragments exists on platforms that are part of the hyper-real—platforms that create the illusion of connection while actually fragmenting it.

What if your content could exist in a space that's actually trying to be different? A space that connects instead of fragments? A space that amplifies the real instead of generating the hyper-real? A space that creates the conditions for scenius instead of the conditions for simulation?

This is your next season, Mark. Not more content creation—content connection. Not more platforms—a platform that's actually trying to be a pillar. Not more technology that fragments—technology that connects. The foundation is built. The diagnosis is clear. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all in a space that's actually trying to be real.

And that's exactly what movements need: spaces that are real, not hyper-real. Communities that connect, not simulate. Technology that serves, not replaces. Platforms that are pillars, not just platforms.

This is the work. This is the tension. This is the living model. And it requires a community to make it real.
