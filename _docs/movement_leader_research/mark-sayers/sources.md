## Research Limitations

1. **Web Search Tool Limitations**: The web search tool used returned process descriptions and general information rather than direct access to all platforms and content. Comprehensive platform exploration would require direct website visits.

2. **Initial Research Phase**: This represents initial discovery. Further investigation needed for:
   - Complete platform mapping
   - Content volume assessment (podcast episodes, blog posts, articles)
   - Detailed content analysis
   - Comprehensive source verification
   - Social media presence verification
   - Video content discovery
   - Blog content analysis
   - Red Church website exploration
   - Podcast platform verification

3. **Source Verification Needed**: Many sources referenced in search results need direct verification through:
   - Website visits
   - Platform exploration
   - Cross-referencing multiple sources
   - Direct content analysis

4. **Content Volume Assessment**: Initial research identified content forms and themes, but detailed volume assessment requires:
   - Blog post counting
   - Video content cataloging
   - Podcast episode identification and counting
   - Article publication verification
   - Sermon/teaching content cataloging
   - Speaking engagement cataloging

3. Book retailer verification:
   - Amazon author page
   - Goodreads author page
   - ChristianBook.com
   - Publisher websites

4. Content cataloging:
   - Podcast episodes (count, titles, themes)
   - Blog posts (if present)
   - Articles (if published in magazines/publications)
   - Video content (sermons, talks, interviews)
