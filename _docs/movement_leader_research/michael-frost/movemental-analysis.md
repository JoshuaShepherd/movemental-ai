**Research Date**: January 4, 2026

## Platform Gaps Assessment

### Current Platform Limitations

**Potential Limitations**:
1. **Platform Fragmentation**: Content may be scattered across multiple platforms (personal website, organizational websites, publisher sites, academic platforms)
2. **Platform Ownership**: Mix of owned (mikefrost.net) and rented platforms (social media, publisher sites)
3. **Content Silos**: Books, blog articles, organizational resources, training materials, community content may exist in separate silos
4. **Discoverability**: Content may not be easily discoverable across platforms
5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Limited integration between personal website, organizational platforms, and other content locations

### Platform Fragmentation

**Current Distribution**:
- Personal website (mikefrost.net)
- Organizational websites (Tinsley Institute, Forge Mission Training Network, smallboatbigsea - to be verified)
- Publisher websites (multiple book publishers)

- Potential social media platforms
- Conference platforms

**Fragmentation Impact**:

**Ownership Implications**:
- Some content on platforms not fully controlled

### Revenue Model Gaps

**Current Revenue Models** (to be verified):

**Potential Gaps**:
