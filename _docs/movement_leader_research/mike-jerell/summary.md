**Next Steps**:

## Discoverability Assessment

**No discoverability indicators** - No digital presence discovered.

## Gap Analysis

**Cannot assess** - No embodied work or digital expression identified.

Without information about embodied work (teaching, speaking, ministry roles, publications) or digital expression, no gap analysis can be performed.

## Movemental Opportunities

**Cannot assess** - No content or platforms identified.

Without information about existing work or digital presence, no Movemental-specific opportunities can be identified.

## What We Will NOT Do

- We will not make assumptions about identity without verification
- We will not proceed with analysis without confirmed identity
- We will not create content or recommendations without user input
- We will not judge or evaluate work that hasn't been discovered

## Research Limitations

- **Name Spelling**: Possible variations (Jerrell, Jerel) may prevent discovery
- **Emerging Leader**: Person may be an emerging leader without established digital presence
- **Private Ministry**: Person may be in private ministry without public digital footprint
- **Minimal Digital Presence**: Person may have intentionally minimal or no digital presence
- **Regional/Local Leader**: Person may be a local/regional leader not widely discoverable online
- **Name Mismatch**: The provided name may not match the person's public identity
- **Research Scope**: Limited to publicly available information

## Recommendations

1. **User Verification**: Confirm correct name spelling and identity
2. **Additional Information**: Provide any of the following:
   - Geographic location
   - Institutional affiliations (church, seminary, organization)
   - Published works (books, articles)
   - Professional roles (pastor, author, speaker, theologian)
   - Social media handles
   - Website URL
   - Movement/network participation
3. **Alternative Search**: If name spelling differs, we can conduct searches with correct spelling
4. **Manual Discovery**: If you can provide specific URLs or platforms, we can verify those directly

## Next Steps

Once identity is verified and additional information is provided:
1. Re-conduct identity verification with confirmed information
2. Discover digital presence with verified identity
3. Analyze content and digital ecosystem
4. Perform gap analysis between embodied and digital work
5. Assess Movemental-specific opportunities
