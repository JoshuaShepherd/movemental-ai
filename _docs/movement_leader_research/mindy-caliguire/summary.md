# Digital Reality Profile: Mindy Caliguire

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: High

## Executive Summary

Mindy Caliguire is a recognized leader in spiritual formation and soul care, serving as co-founder and president of Soul Care, a ministry dedicated to promoting soul health among leaders. Based in Colorado (Boulder area) where she and her husband, Jeff, host transformational retreats at Whisper Ranch, Mindy has authored four books on spiritual formation and soul care, with her latest work "Ignite Your Soul" published in September 2024. Her journey into soul care began in 1995 when, after years of overwork and spiritual depletion while church planting in Boston, she experienced a physical collapse that revealed the brittle state of her soul. This pivotal moment led her to a path of healing and spiritual vitality, which became her calling to guide others toward soul health.

Mindy's digital presence centers around soulcare.com, the Soul Care ministry website, which serves over 1,000 entities, has more than 10,000 weekly subscribers, and has distributed over 50,000 resources. Her content spans books, blog posts, podcast appearances, speaking engagements, and ministry resources focused on soul care, spiritual formation, leader resilience, and burnout recovery. She has served in executive leadership roles at Gloo and the Willow Creek Association (now Global Leadership Network) and is a sought-after speaker and advisor for organizations like Compassion International, ECFA, and the National Christian Foundation.
