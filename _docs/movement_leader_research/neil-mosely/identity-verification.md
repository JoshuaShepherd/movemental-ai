## Identity Verification Notes

**Important Note**: The person identified through research (Neil Mosley - UK higher education consultant) does not appear to align with Movemental's target audience of "Christian movement thought leaders, authors, preachers, and practitioners who shape Christian movement through ideas, teaching, writing, and leadership."

**Potential Issues**:
- No evidence of Christian ministry, theology, or movement leadership focus
- Focus is on higher education and online learning, not Christian thought leadership
- No evidence of published books on Christian topics
- No evidence of pastoral, preaching, or Christian ministry roles
- No evidence of association with Christian movements or networks

**Possible Explanations**:
1. This may be a different person than intended (name spelling variation: "Mosely" vs "Mosley")
2. The intended person may have limited digital presence
3. The intended person may use a different name professionally
4. Additional research may be needed to find the correct person

## Potential Ambiguity

**Identity Ambiguity**: High

**Multiple Possibilities**:
- **Neil Mosley (UK Education Consultant)**: UK-based higher education consultant - **This is what was found in research**
- **Neil Mosely (Intended Subject)**: May be a different person with Christian ministry focus - **Not found in initial research**

**Distinguishing Factors Needed**:
- Christian ministry or theological background
- Published books on Christian topics
- Pastoral, preaching, or Christian leadership roles
- Association with Christian movements or networks
- Location (if different from UK)

## Next Steps

- Verify if this is the correct person intended for Movemental research
- If not, conduct additional searches with:
  - Different name spellings (Neil Moseley, Neil Mosely, etc.)
  - Christian ministry context terms
  - Theological or pastoral role terms
  - Christian movement network associations
- If this is the correct person, note that they may not fit Movemental's target audience profile
- Continue with Phase 2: Digital Presence Discovery (documenting what exists regardless of fit)
