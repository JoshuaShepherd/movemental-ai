# Reflected Understanding

This folder holds **one markdown file per movement leader**: a reflected understanding generated from the research in the sibling folders (e.g. `../alan-hirsch/`, `../brad-brisco/`).

**Naming:** `[leader-slug].md` — e.g. `alan-hirsch.md`, `brad-brisco.md`, `mark-sayers.md`.

**Source prompt:** `_docs/_prompts/generate-reflected-understanding.md` — apply that prompt to a single leader (by name) to produce the full copy and save it here under the slug filename.

**Purpose:** Each file is a concise reflection spoken back so the leader could endorse the language—familiar, with edges that deepen. Used for onboarding, “meet you where you are” copy, and alignment.

**Canonical example:** The structure and tone are defined in `_docs/_prompts/alan-hirsch-reflected-understanding.md` (sections 1–7 plus closing; exclude the supplemental sections from the output file).
