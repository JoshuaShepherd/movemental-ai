# Alan Hirsch: Reflected Understanding

A concise reflection spoken back so the language could be endorsed—familiar, but with edges that deepen.

## Calling

You're called to **reactivate what's latent**. Not to invent a new church or a new ministry type, but to name and unlock what's already in the Body: the intelligence, the capacities, the apostolic and prophetic and evangelistic and shepherd and teacher functions that were always there and got buried under institution. Your job is to help the church remember itself—to recover its "forgotten ways" and its 5Q—so it can move again as movement, not only as organization. You're not selling a brand; you're midwifing a recovery. The language you already use—*reactivating*, *original intelligence*, *latent potencies*—is the right language. It's prophetic in the sense that it names what God has already given and calls people to step into it; it's not weird or inflated because it stays tethered to Scripture, to practice, and to the actual cost of leaving the center to lead from the edge.

## Audience

**Who they are.** The people who respond to your work are movement-oriented: they care about multiplication, sentness, and the reactivation of the Body's full ministry. They don't just want better programs; they want the church to function as movement again. They're pastors, church planters, denominational and network leaders, seminary faculty and students, and practitioners in mission and formation—often 40% church leaders, 25% academic, 20% movement practitioners, 15% international—with a strong slice of emerging leaders who are looking for frameworks that are both theologically serious and practically usable.

**Personas.**  
- **The reforming pastor** — Seminary-trained, often in a large or legacy church, feeling the gap between institution and mission; they're looking for a way to move their people and structures without abandoning theology or community.  
- **The multiplication leader** — Already thinking in networks and reproduction; they want APEST and apostolic movement made concrete (Forge, 100Movements, 5Q, Future Travelers).  
- **The academic-practitioner** — Teaches or researches mission, ecclesiology, leadership; they use your books in courses and want their students to have a clear path from theory to practice.  
- **The international / non-English leader** — Deeply movement-oriented, often in the majority world; they want your frameworks but often can't access them in language or format that works.

**TAM.** Your engaged audience is in the **50,000+** range; the broader TAM of movement-oriented Christians who would benefit from your content is far larger—including many who don't yet know your name but are searching for exactly what you articulate (missional church, APEST, apostolic movements, church multiplication, fivefold). The gap between "people who know and use your work" and "people who would be formed by it if they could find it" is significant.

## Existing Content (Before the Platform We're Building)

**Where it lives.** Your content lives in **books** (9+ with IVP and co-authors), **organizational sites** (100Movements, Forge, Future Travelers, 5Q Collective), **academic contexts** (Fuller, Wheaton, George Fox, Asbury—including the M.A. you co-founded), **conference and speaking** (Australia, Europe, United States), and **training/consulting** (Future Travelers, 5Q, Forge). Your personal site (alanhirsch.org) and IVP author page anchor "Alan Hirsch" and the books; the rest is distributed across those other domains.

**Credibility.** It's high. You're a benchmark voice in movement theology: seminal books, multiple organizations that multiply practitioners, academic appointments, and a clear cost paid for staying at the edge. The work is credible; the issue isn't authority, it's **visibility, connection, and reuse**.

**Offline vs online.** A lot of the real work is **offline or event-based**: talks, courses, consulting, cohort work. What's **online** is mostly: book listings and metadata, org homepages, and the **5Q/APEST assessment** on 5Q's site. So the only substantial "live" digital asset that's clearly *yours* and *interactive* in the public mind is that assessment. The rest of the corpus—the ideas in the books, the substance of talks and courses—is largely **static** (fixed print or scattered pages) or **unpublished** (talks and lectures not systematically turned into findable, linkable, reusable digital objects).

**How it likely lives online now.** As **silos**: books on retailer/publisher pages, org content on org sites, academic material behind institutional access, speaking on assorted event/church sites. There's no single place where "everything Alan has said and written about APEST" or "missional movement" is structured, linked, and easy to find. So it doesn't **move** in the sense of circulating, compounding, and connecting—it stays where it was first put.

**NOTs that Movemental addresses directly:**

- Your content is likely **not translated** into key languages—including those with large populations of movement-oriented Christians—so whole regions can't access it in their language.
- It is **not** structured, formatted, and repurposed to live as **digital content** in a way that maximizes transformation, engagement, feedback, and connection (e.g. talks → articles, book themes → courses, training → findable resources).
- It is **not** connected to a **coherent, personalized AI system** that reflects your voice and body of work and supports the work with wise efficiencies.
- It is **not** optimized for **amplification and movement** in the sense of **SEO + GEO**—so people searching for "apostolic movement," "APEST," "missional church," or "fivefold ministry" often don't land on your material first.
- It is **not** **interconnected**—books don't visibly link to org resources, talks don't tie back to books, academic and practical content don't sit in one discoverable ecosystem.
- It is **not** **owned and unified**—you don't have one place you control where your credibility, your content, and your network are clearly attached to you, so algorithms and platforms don't consistently "see" you as the go-to voice for this space.
- It is **not** **legible to systems**—much of the best material is in long-form print or behind events, so search and AI can't reliably find, cite, or extend it.

Movemental is built to speak to these NOTs: translation, structure/repurpose, AI that serves your voice, discoverability (SEO + GEO), interconnection, ownership, and legibility—so your content can move.

## Constraints

Movement leaders with mDNA priorities live under **time** and **money** constraints that are emblematic, not personal failure. You're running multiple organizations, teaching, writing, speaking internationally, and co-founding academic programs. Time for "content strategy," repurposing talks into articles, or building a unified digital home is scarce because the work is in the room—with leaders, churches, and movements. Money is often tied to that same embodied work: consulting, training, speaking, and book advances/royalties—not to a separate "digital content" budget. So the question "Why isn't all of this already online, structured, and moving?" isn't about desire; it's about **capacity**. The desire to reach everyone God has given you is there; the hours and the dedicated budget to make that happen at scale, in every language and format, typically are not. Those constraints shape every content decision: what gets recorded, what gets translated, what gets turned into a course or an article. A platform that reduces the lift—that helps structure, repurpose, connect, and amplify what you already do—addresses those constraints without asking you to become a different kind of leader.

## Commerce

**The likely financial picture from your content.**  

**Books.** You're with a respected publisher (IVP). Trade publishing usually returns to the author on the order of **10–15%** of revenue (royalties on net or list price); the rest goes to publisher, distribution, and retail. So the return on each book sold is credible but modest relative to the influence of the work. Books also drive speaking, consulting, and org revenue—so the real "commerce" from the books isn't only royalties; it's the authority that generates invitations and partnerships.

**Online, without a real content platform.** If most of your public presence online is **metadata** (book titles, author bios, org homepages) and **one substantive digital asset** (the 5Q/APEST assessment), then almost no revenue is coming *from* digital content itself—no subscriptions, no courses, no premium articles, no direct audience monetization. The assessment may drive leads into 5Q Collective (training, coaching), but the rest of the corpus isn't doing revenue work online. So the situation is: **strong credibility and influence, multiple revenue streams from embodied work (speaking, consulting, training, orgs), but very little structured, owned digital content that generates its own revenue.** That's the norm for many movement leaders—and it's exactly the gap a platform built for you is meant to address: same voice, same mission, but with content that's findable, connected, and able to support sustainability (e.g. courses, memberships, premium access) without replacing the work you're already doing.
