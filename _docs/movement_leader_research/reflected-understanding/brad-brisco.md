# Brad Brisco: Reflected Understanding

A concise reflection spoken back so the language could be endorsed—familiar, but with edges that deepen.

## Calling

You're called to **missional ecclesiology and multiplication**—not to run a single church or hold one post, but to help the church function as sent missionary people and to equip leaders for church planting and co-vocational ministry. You think in terms of movement: reproduction, networks, and the long run. You're not selling a brand; you're forming practitioners. Your work at Send Network (Director of Multiplication Strategies), your 20+ years in church planting, your co-founding of Forge Kansas City and Sentralized Conference, and your 18+ years of college-level teaching all serve one end: churches and leaders who embody mission and multiply. Success for you is movement that outlasts you—co-vocational planters, missional congregations, and frameworks that are both theologically serious and practically usable.

## Audience

**Who they are.** The people who respond to your work are movement-oriented: they care about church planting, multiplication strategies, missional living, and the integration of marketplace and ministry. They're pastors, church planters, denominational and network leaders, college and seminary students, and practitioners in mission—often in North America but with growing interest in co-vocational and bivocational models everywhere. They don't just want better programs; they want the church to function as sent and reproducing.

**Personas.**  
- **The church multiplication leader** — Already in Send Network, NAMB, or similar; they want strategies and frameworks for multiplication and co-vocational planting.  
- **The seminary or college educator** — Teaching mission, ecclesiology, or church planting; they use your books and want their students to have a clear path from theory to practice.  
- **The co-vocational planter** — Bivocational or covocational; they want practical theology and practices (Covocational Church Planting, Missional Essentials, Next Door As It Is In Heaven).  
- **The digital ecclesiology explorer** — Engaging your podcast appearances and articles on church in the digital age; they want frameworks that don't assume business as usual.

**TAM.** Your engaged audience includes those who know you through Send Network, Forge Kansas City, Sentralized, New Churches, ChurchLeaders.com, and your books. The broader TAM of movement-oriented leaders who would benefit from your content—missional ecclesiology, church planting, co-vocational ministry, theology of place, apostolic movements—is larger than those who can currently find it in one place. The gap between "people who know and use your work" and "people who would be formed by it if they could find it" is significant.

## Existing Content (Before the Platform We're Building)

**Where it lives.** Your content lives in **books** (5 co-authored: Missional Essentials, The Missional Quest, Next Door As It Is In Heaven, ReThink, Covocational Church Planting—available on Amazon and ChristianBook.com), **your personal site** (missionalchurchnetwork.com, with blog and resources), **article platforms** (New Churches, ChurchLeaders.com), **podcast appearances** (5+ confirmed episodes across Shifting Culture, The Church Digital, H2 Leadership, Ephesiology, Into the Harvest), **teaching** (18+ years of college-level courses: History of Christianity, Religion in America, Life of Paul, Discipleship and Evangelism, Theology of Place, Launching Apostolic Movements, Worship), and **conference/training** (Sentralized Conference, Forge Kansas City). Your primary digital hub is missionalchurchnetwork.com; the rest is distributed across those other domains.

**Credibility.** It's high. You're a recognized thought leader in missional ecclesiology and church planting: strategic role at Send Network/NAMB, co-founded Forge Kansas City and Sentralized, 5 co-authored books, 18+ years teaching, 20+ years church planting. The work is credible; the issue isn't authority, it's **visibility, connection, and reuse**—and the fact that much of your best work (teaching, conference content, training) isn't fully digitized or interconnected.

**Offline vs online.** A lot of the real work is **offline or behind institutional access**: 18+ years of teaching content (may be in LMS, not public), Sentralized and Forge Kansas City training, conference talks. What's **online** is your blog, regular articles on New Churches and ChurchLeaders.com, book metadata on retailers, and podcast guest appearances. So you have more digital presence than many—but no single place where "everything Brad has said and written about missional ecclesiology, church planting, and co-vocational ministry" is structured, linked, and easy to find. Content exists in multiple formats and on multiple platforms; it doesn't **move** in the sense of circulating, compounding, and connecting as one ecosystem.

**NOTs that Movemental addresses directly:**

- Your content is **not** fully **interconnected**—books, articles, podcast appearances, and teaching don't visibly link in one discoverable ecosystem; someone searching for "co-vocational church planting" or "missional essentials" may not land on your material first or see how it all fits together.
- It is **not** fully **structured and repurposed**—18+ years of teaching could become articles and courses; speaking and podcast content could be transcribed and published; the gap between "what you've taught" and "what's findable online" is large.
- It is **not** **owned and unified**—you have an owned site (missionalchurchnetwork.com), but much of your reach is on rented platforms (New Churches, ChurchLeaders.com, Amazon, podcast hosts); you don't have one place you control where your credibility, your content, and your network are clearly attached to you so that algorithms and searchers consistently "see" you as the go-to voice.
- It is **not** optimized for **amplification and movement** in the sense of **SEO + GEO**—discoverability is limited to individual platforms; content may not be fully indexed or cross-referenced.
- It is **not** **legible to systems**—teaching content and many talks aren't systematically turned into findable, linkable, reusable digital objects, so search and AI can't reliably find, cite, or extend the full body of work.
- **Revenue from digital content** is limited—articles don't generate direct revenue; teaching is institutional; books carry the monetization. There's no structured path to subscriptions, courses, or premium content that you own.

Movemental is built to speak to these NOTs: interconnection, structure/repurpose, discoverability (SEO + GEO), ownership and unification, legibility to systems, and a path to additional revenue streams (courses, subscriptions, premium content)—so your content can move.

## Constraints

Movement leaders in multiplication and church planting live under **time** and **attention** constraints that are emblematic, not personal failure. You're directing multiplication strategies at Send Network, teaching at the college level, co-leading Forge Kansas City and Sentralized, and writing and speaking. Time for "content strategy," repurposing 18 years of teaching into articles and courses, or building a unified digital home is scarce because the work is in the room—with leaders, churches, and networks. Money is tied to that same embodied work: your role at NAMB, teaching, speaking, and book royalties—not to a separate "digital content" budget. So the question "Why isn't all of this already online, structured, and moving?" isn't about desire; it's about **capacity**. The desire to equip everyone God has given you is there; the hours and the dedicated budget to digitize, repurpose, and unify at scale typically are not. A platform that reduces the lift—that helps structure, repurpose, connect, and amplify what you already do—addresses those constraints without asking you to become a different kind of leader.

## Commerce

**The likely financial picture from your content.**  

**Books.** You have 5 co-authored books (print and digital on Amazon, ChristianBook.com). Trade publishing usually returns to authors on the order of **10–15%** of revenue; the rest goes to publisher, distribution, and retail. So the return on each book sold is credible but modest relative to the influence of the work. Books also drive authority that generates speaking and network invitations—so the real "commerce" from the books isn't only royalties; it's the credibility that supports your role and your partnerships.

**Articles and teaching.** Articles on New Churches and ChurchLeaders.com likely don't generate direct revenue to you; they build visibility and authority. Teaching revenue is through institutions, not through owned digital content. So the situation is: **strong credibility and influence, revenue from books and from your role and speaking, but very little structured, owned digital content that generates its own revenue**—no subscriptions, no courses, no premium content you control. That's the norm for many movement leaders—and it's exactly the gap a platform built for you is meant to address: same voice, same mission, but with content that's findable, connected, and able to support sustainability (e.g. courses developed from your teaching, memberships, premium access) without replacing the work you're already doing.

## Credibility

Your credibility in the room—Send Network, Forge Kansas City, Sentralized, the classroom, church planting networks—is clear. Online, it's **partial**: your name and books show up; your articles and podcast appearances add to it. But the *full* picture—missional ecclesiology, church planting, co-vocational ministry, 18 years of teaching, digital ecclesiology—isn't assembled in one place that people can find and trust. Building that used to mean either a big agency lift or hours you don't have. It's become possible to close that gap in a way that respects your constraints—so your content can move without you having to become a full-time content operator.
