# Movemental-Specific Analysis: Rob Wegner

**Research Date**: January 6, 2026

## Platform Gaps Assessment

### Current Platform Limitations

**Potential Limitations**:
1. **Platform Fragmentation**: Content distributed across multiple platforms (KC Underground website, Exponential platform, NewThing network, podcast platforms, book retailers)
2. **Platform Ownership**: Mix of owned (KC Underground website) and rented platforms (Exponential, NewThing, social media, podcast platforms, book retailers)
3. **Content Silos**: Book, podcast, articles, training, conference content may exist in separate silos
4. **Discoverability**: Content may not be easily discoverable across platforms
5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Limited integration between platforms
6. **Personal vs. Organizational**: May lack clear personal content hub separate from organizational content

### Platform Fragmentation

**Current Distribution**:
- KC Underground website (kcunderground.org)

**Fragmentation Impact**:

- Organizational platforms may not fully represent personal content

### Revenue Model Gaps

- Training programs

**Potential Gaps**:
- Limited direct content monetization
