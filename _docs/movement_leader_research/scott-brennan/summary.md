## What We Will NOT Do

- Research is based on publicly available information only
- Research respects privacy and does not access private/paywalled content
- Research does not make assumptions about identity without clear evidence
- Research acknowledges limitations and uncertainties clearly

## Research Limitations

1. **No Clear Match Found**: Comprehensive search did not identify a "Scott Brennan" matching Movemental's target audience profile
2. **Based on Publicly Available Information Only**: Research limited to publicly accessible, searchable content
3. **Search Engine Limitations**: Some information may not be indexed by search engines
4. **Private/Paywalled Content**: Information may exist behind paywalls or on private platforms
5. **Limited Digital Presence**: Person may have minimal or no public digital presence
6. **Name Variations**: Person may use different name or spelling
7. **Recent Emergence**: Person may be newly emerging with limited online presence

## Recommendations for Further Research

1. **Verify Exact Name**: Confirm the exact name (including middle name, nickname, or alternative spelling)
2. **Check Name Variations**: Verify if the person uses a different professional name
3. **Verify Minimal Presence**: Check if the person has a minimal digital presence
4. **Check Private Platforms**: Verify if content exists on private/paywalled platforms
5. **Verify Context**: Confirm if the person works in a Christian context but is not publicly identified as a movement leader/author/pastor
6. **Confirm Identity**: Verify if this is the correct person for research

## Potential Issues

1. **Name Variant**: The person may use a different name (middle name, nickname, etc.)
2. **Spelling Variation**: The name may be spelled differently
3. **Limited Digital Presence**: The person may have minimal or no public digital presence
4. **Recent Emergence**: The person may be newly emerging in the movement with limited online presence
5. **Private/Unlisted Content**: Content may exist but be behind paywalls, private platforms, or not indexed by search engines
6. **Different Context**: The person may work in a Christian context but not be publicly identified as a movement leader/author/pastor
