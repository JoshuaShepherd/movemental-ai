# Digital Reality Profile: Scott Shepherd

**Research Date**: January 6, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: High  
**Sources**: See sources.md

## Executive Summary

Dr. C. Scott Shepherd is a worship and music ministry specialist with over 30 years of experience, currently serving as Associate Director of Renaissance at Bethel University in McKenzie, Tennessee. He previously served for six years as the Worship and Music Specialist for the Tennessee Baptist Convention and has been the conductor of the Tennessee Men's Chorale and Tennessee Ladies Chorus since 2017. He holds a doctorate in Worship Studies from the Robert E. Webber Institute for Worship Studies and resides in Henry, Tennessee, with his wife Traci and their four children.

Dr. Shepherd's digital presence is primarily institutional rather than personal. While he has significant embodied work through teaching, worship leading, choral conducting, and state convention ministry, limited personal digital expression was discovered in initial research. His content appears to be primarily distributed through institutional platforms (Bethel University, Tennessee Baptist Convention, choral organizations) rather than personal platforms.

The primary opportunity for Movemental lies in providing a personal platform for content ownership and centralization, enabling the repurposing of his extensive teaching, worship leading, and choral conducting experience into digital content forms (articles, courses, resources, videos), and improving discoverability through network effects.
