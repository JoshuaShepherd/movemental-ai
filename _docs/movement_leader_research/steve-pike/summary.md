# Digital Reality Profile: Steve Pike

**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: Medium-High

## Executive Summary

Steve Pike is a recognized Christian movement leader focused on urban church planting and church multiplication, with a track record of assisting in the establishment of over 2,000 new congregations across the United States. As the president and founder of Urban Islands Project and the former founding director of Church Multiplication Network, Pike has established himself as a key voice in urban ministry and church multiplication movements.

His digital presence appears primarily organizational rather than personal, with content distributed through Urban Islands Project and Church Multiplication Network platforms. Initial research did not identify a personal website, blog, published books, or active social media presence, suggesting an organizational-focused approach to digital presence rather than personal branding.

Pike's work demonstrates strong alignment with Movemental's target audience of Christian movement thought leaders, authors, preachers, and practitioners, specifically in the areas of urban church planting, church multiplication, and movement building.

**Primary Opportunities**: Development of personal content presence, content repurposing from organizational resources, documentation of extensive experience (2,000+ congregations), content series development around key themes (urban ministry, multiplication, network building), and network amplification through Movemental's platform.
