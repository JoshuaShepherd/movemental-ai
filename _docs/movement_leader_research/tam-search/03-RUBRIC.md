# Movemental Thought Leader Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose

This rubric defines the criteria for identifying and evaluating potential Movemental thought leaders. It is designed to surface candidates across ALL domains who embody movemental DNA—not just those writing explicitly about movements.

## Key Insight: Movemental DNA vs. Movemental Topic

**Critical distinction**: We seek **writers who are movemental** (embodying transformation, multiplication, credibility through practice) rather than only **movemental writers** (those explicitly writing about movements).

This means our TAM includes:
- **10% Apostolic Articulators**: Write explicitly about movements, mission, ecclesiology
- **90% Domain Practitioners**: Write about psychology, AI, worship, leadership, justice, parenting, etc.—but embody movemental DNA

## THE SEVEN GATES OF CREDIBILITY

Every candidate must pass these qualitative gates before scoring:

### Gate 1: Embodied Practice Over Theory (10+ years)
- Can point to actual practice in their domain, not just theory
- Track record of boots-on-ground experience
- **Disqualifying**: Pure academics with no implementation

### Gate 2: Multiplication Evidence
- Have created practitioners who create practitioners (2nd/3rd generation impact)
- Not just mentoring, but multiplying multipliers
- **Disqualifying**: Influence that dies with their direct involvement

### Gate 3: Movement Over Institution
- Catalyzes organic movement or maintains structures?
- Creates momentum that spreads beyond their control
- **Disqualifying**: Institution-preservers without movement catalysis

### Gate 4: Prophetic Edge
- Does their work challenge the status quo?
- Makes people uncomfortable, disrupts, provokes
- **Disqualifying**: Safely mainstream without distinctive voice

### Gate 5: Credibility Through Suffering
- Have they paid a cost for their convictions?
- Credibility forged through sacrifice
- **Note**: Not required but adds significant weight

### Gate 6: Theological Depth (Even If Implicit)
- Work shaped by deep Christian formation
- "Christianity latent"—you taste it even when not labeled
- **Disqualifying**: Purely secular without spiritual grounding

### Gate 7: Network Coherence (Scenius Test)
- Does their work feel like same movement as Hirsch/Brisco?
- Would their presence enhance or dilute platform credibility?
- **Disqualifying**: Dilutes overall network quality
