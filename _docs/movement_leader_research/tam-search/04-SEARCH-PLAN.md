## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### For Each Search:

1. **Execute search** using WebSearch tool
2. **Extract names** mentioned in results
3. **Deduplicate** against master list
4. **Capture basic info:**
   - Full name
   - Primary domain/topic
   - Key affiliations
   - Notable works (books, organizations)
   - Website/social presence

### Evaluation Protocol:

1. **Initial Gate Check** - Does the person pass the 7 Gates?
2. **Quantitative Scoring** - Apply 100-point rubric
3. **Tier Assignment** - Flagship/Proven/Emerging/Pipeline
4. **Notes** - Key observations, network connections

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Results will be compiled in:
- `03-SEARCH-RESULTS.md` - Raw search findings organized by query
- `04-MASTER-LIST.md` - Deduplicated master list with basic info
- `05-SCORED-RANKINGS.md` - Full rubric scores and tier rankings

---

## SEARCH EXECUTION ORDER

Priority order for maximum efficiency:

1. **Network mapping first** - Start with known networks to get verified names
2. **Apostolic core** - Direct movement writers
3. **High-TAM domains** - Leadership, psychology, family (largest audiences)
4. **Specialized domains** - Justice, worship, technology

---

## AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

When executing this plan, the agent should:

1. Run searches systematically, documenting each query and its results
2. Be thorough but avoid duplicate effort—if a name appears multiple times, note the cross-references
3. For each person found, attempt to find:
   - Published books (titles)
   - Current organizational role
   - Approximate audience size (social followers, newsletter, etc.)
   - Any connections to known movemental leaders
4. Apply skepticism—not everyone who appears in search is a fit
5. Note "strong potential" vs "confirmed fit" based on available information
6. Flag names requiring deeper research

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

- **100-300 names** from search process
- **50-100 candidates** passing initial gates
- **20-40 high-priority** (Flagship or Proven tier)
- **Clear next steps** for outreach prioritization
