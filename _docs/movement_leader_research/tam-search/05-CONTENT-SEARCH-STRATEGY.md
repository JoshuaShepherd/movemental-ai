# Content-Based Search Strategy

## The Problem with Network-Only Search

The initial search strategy was **network-based**:
- Find people connected to Forge, Exponential, 100 Movements, etc.
- Follow co-authorship chains from Hirsch, Brisco, etc.
- Search conference speaker lists

**Limitations**:
1. Over-indexes on people using explicit "missional" vocabulary
2. Misses domain practitioners with movemental DNA but different language
3. Creates echo chamber of already-connected leaders
4. Doesn't find the psychologist, technologist, or artist who *embodies* movement principles without *writing about* movements

## The Content-Based Approach

Instead of "who do they know," ask "what do they write about and how?"

### Strategy Overview

1. **Keyword Identification** - Define terms that indicate movemental DNA across domains
2. **Content Discovery** - Search for books, articles, podcasts with these keywords
3. **Content Analysis** - Evaluate what the content reveals about the author's alignment
4. **Cross-Reference** - Check if high-match authors appear in network searches (validation)

## CONTENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

When a search surfaces a potential candidate, analyze their content for:

### 1. Theological Indicators

| Question | Movemental Answer |
|----------|------------------|
| What is the church for? | Sent to bless, not gathered to consume |
| What is discipleship? | Whole-life formation, not information transfer |
| What is leadership? | Empowering others, not controlling outcomes |
| What is success? | Multiplication and transformation, not accumulation |
| Where does God work? | Everywhere, not just "sacred" spaces |

### 2. Structural Indicators

| Question | Movemental Answer |
|----------|------------------|
| How do they organize? | Networks > hierarchies |
| How do they scale? | Multiplication > addition |
| How do they train? | Apprenticeship > curriculum |
| How do they measure? | Sending capacity > attendance |

### 3. Language Indicators

| Instead of... | They say... |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Church growth" | "Kingdom expansion" |
| "Membership" | "Discipleship" |
| "Programs" | "Practices" / "Rhythms" |
| "Audience" | "Community" |
| "Platform" | "Movement" |
| "Consumers" | "Missionaries" |
| "Success" | "Faithfulness" / "Fruitfulness" |

### 4. Posture Indicators

| Question | Movemental Posture |
|----------|-------------------|
| Toward culture? | Engaged, not withdrawn or accommodating |
| Toward tradition? | Rooted, not rootless or rigid |
| Toward innovation? | Curious, not fearful or faddish |
| Toward institution? | Reforming, not destroying or defending |
| Toward other leaders? | Collaborative, not competitive |

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Keyword Search

1. Run domain-specific keyword searches
2. Capture book titles, article headlines, podcast names
3. Note author names for further research

### Phase 2: Author Investigation

For each author surfaced:
1. Find their primary platform (website, substack, podcast)
2. Read 2-3 representative pieces
3. Note language patterns and theological indicators
4. Check for network connections (validation)

### Phase 3: Content Scoring

Add these content-based criteria to the rubric:

| Criteria | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Movemental vocabulary | 0-5 | Uses multiplication/incarnational/kingdom language |
| Theological alignment | 0-5 | Sent church, whole-life discipleship, empowering leadership |
| Structural alignment | 0-5 | Network thinking, multiplication metrics |
| Posture alignment | 0-5 | Engaged, rooted, collaborative |
| **Content Sub-Total** | 0-20 | Add to existing 100-point rubric |

### Phase 4: Cross-Reference

- If high content score + low network visibility → **Hidden gem** (priority discovery)
- If high content score + high network visibility → **Confirmed fit** (validation)
- If low content score + high network visibility → **Question fit** (re-evaluate)

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

This content-based approach should surface:

1. **Domain practitioners with movemental DNA** who don't use "missional" vocabulary
2. **Writers outside the network** who haven't been discovered yet
3. **Emerging voices** who aren't conference speakers yet
4. **International voices** writing in English but not in US networks
5. **Women and diverse voices** often underrepresented in network-based search

### Target Additions

| Domain | Expected New Candidates |
|--------|------------------------|
| Psychology/Soul Care | 10-15 |
| Technology/Culture | 5-10 |
| Worship/Liturgy | 5-10 |
| Family/Parenting | 10-15 |
| Leadership/Organization | 10-15 |
| Justice/Urban | 5-10 |
| **Total** | 45-75 new candidates |

## SAMPLE CONTENT-BASED SEARCHES TO EXECUTE

### Immediate Priority

1. `"soul care" Christian author NOT "missional" NOT "church planting"`
2. `"faithful presence" technology author NOT Crouch`
3. `"household discipleship" author practitioner`
4. `"liturgical formation" pastor author`
5. `"vocational discipleship" marketplace author`
6. `"embodied spirituality" author practitioner`
7. `"kingdom" "workplace" Christian author`
8. `"intergenerational" "faith formation" author`
9. `"Christian" "community development" author NOT CCDA`
10. `"spiritual practices" "everyday" author`

These searches look for the *concepts* rather than the *networks*, which should surface different candidates.

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING RESEARCH

This content-based strategy should be run **in parallel** with continued network-based search:

          │  - Hidden gems       │
          │  - Confirmed fits    │
          │  - Question marks    │
          └──────────────────────┘
```

The highest-confidence candidates will be those who score high on **both** network connections **and** content alignment.
