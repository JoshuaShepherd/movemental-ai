# Your Next Season: A Content Marketing Playbook for Tim Keel

Tim, I've been tracking your work—from Intuitive Leadership in 2007 to your founding of Jacob's Well to your role with Emergent Village. And here's what I see: you wrote a book that mattered. A book about narrative, metaphor, and embracing chaos. A book about intuitive leadership in a world that was already shifting. And that was 2007. Seventeen years ago. The world has shifted even more since then. The chaos has intensified. The need for intuitive leadership has only grown. But your digital presence? It's quiet. Too quiet.

You understand something that most people don't: leadership isn't linear. It's narrative. It's metaphorical. It's intuitive. It embraces chaos rather than trying to control it. You wrote about this in 2007, and it was ahead of its time. But here's the thing: you've been living it. You've been pastoring Jacob's Well. You've been teaching. You've been leading. You've been navigating the chaos. And all of that embodied work? It's generating insights, frameworks, stories, metaphors. But how much of it is making its way into your digital content ecosystem?

This is the gap, Tim. You wrote a book that mattered, and then you went back to the work. You went back to pastoring. You went back to teaching. You went back to leading. And that's good. That's where it should be. But what if that embodied work could also exist digitally? What if your teaching on intuitive leadership could become articles that help other leaders? What if your sermons on narrative theology could become courses that equip other pastors? What if your insights on embracing chaos could become content that serves a world that's more chaotic than ever? What if your book from 2007 could connect to all of this work in a way that makes it discoverable and accessible?

Right now, your content exists in fragments. Your book is on Baker Publishing's platform. Your teaching is at Jacob's Well. Your network work is with Emergent Village. And each of these exists in its own silo. Someone who reads Intuitive Leadership might not know about your current teaching. Someone who knows about your current teaching might not know about your book. Someone who knows about your book might not know about your insights on navigating the chaos that's only intensified since 2007.

This is the gap. You wrote a book that mattered, and then you kept doing the work. But your digital presence doesn't reflect the depth and breadth of what you've been learning since then. Your embodied work is rich, but your digital expression is fragmented. And here's what's at stake: you've been developing insights, refining frameworks, learning from the chaos. But if that work isn't captured digitally, it's not multiplying. It's not serving people beyond your immediate context. It's not becoming part of the larger conversation about intuitive leadership in an increasingly chaotic world.

Imagine this: someone reads Intuitive Leadership. They're captivated by your vision for leadership that embraces narrative, metaphor, and chaos. They want to go deeper. They find not just your bio, but a curated collection of everything you've created about intuitive leadership—articles, book chapters, sermon series, teaching materials, courses. They discover how your thinking has evolved since 2007. They find content on navigating the specific chaos of 2026, not just 2007. They connect your book to your current teaching to your network work. They see the whole ecosystem, not just one piece of it. And in that ecosystem, they find not just theory, but practice. Not just ideas, but implementation. Not just a book from 2007, but a living body of work that's still growing.

That's the power of interconnection. That's how a book from 2007 becomes a living conversation. That's how embodied work becomes digital content that multiplies.

But here's what I know you're thinking: I wrote the book. I'm pastoring. I'm teaching. I'm leading. Where does content ecosystem building fit?

Here's the beautiful part: you don't need to create new content. You need to capture existing content. You need to digitize your embodied work. That teaching you've been doing at Jacob's Well? It's already developed. Those insights you've been gaining from navigating the chaos? They're already generated. Those frameworks you've been refining? They're already created. The work isn't creating more—it's making what exists accessible.

Let me give you a concrete example. You've been pastoring Jacob's Well for years. You've been teaching. You've been navigating the chaos. That work exists. Those insights exist. Those stories exist. What if you took the core insights from your current teaching and created a series of articles? Not new writing—just capturing what you've already learned since 2007. What if you developed those articles into a course on intuitive leadership for 2026? Not new content—just organizing what already exists. What if you connected that course to your book? Not new connections—just making the existing connections visible. And what if you included stories from your actual leadership? Not theoretical examples—real narratives from navigating the chaos.

This is repurposing at scale. This is making your embodied work digitally accessible. This is taking that pastoral teaching and turning it into a content library that serves people beyond your church.

And here's where the time gap becomes an opportunity. Your book was published in 2007. The world has changed. The chaos has intensified. The need for intuitive leadership has only grown. But your book? It's still relevant. It's still needed. But what if it could be connected to your current thinking? What if it could be expanded with your current insights? What if it could become part of a living conversation rather than a static book from 2007?

This isn't about replacing what you're doing. It's about amplifying it. Your book stays with Baker Publishing. Your pastoral work continues. Your teaching continues. Your network work continues. But now they're all connected. Now they're all discoverable in one place. Now they're all working together to create something bigger than the sum of their parts.

The network effects are where this gets really interesting. When your content is interconnected, when it's discoverable, when it's part of a larger ecosystem, other people start connecting to it. Other leaders reference your work. Other pastors link to your articles. Other teachers use your frameworks. Other practitioners adapt your metaphors. Your content starts multiplying not just through your efforts, but through the efforts of others who discover it, engage with it, adapt it, and share it.

This is what you've been building toward, Tim. All that pastoral work. All that teaching. All that leadership. All that book writing. They're not separate things. They're one body of work. They're one contribution to the conversation about intuitive leadership in a chaotic world. And it's time they started working together like they were always meant to.

The playbook is simple, but it's not easy. First, aggregate. Bring everything into one place. Your book. Your teaching content. Your sermon series. Your leadership insights. Everything. Second, interconnect. Link related content. Create pathways. Build the connective tissue between your book and your teaching and your network work. Third, repurpose. Turn teaching insights into articles. Turn sermon series into courses. Turn leadership frameworks into content. Turn book concepts into expanded material. Fourth, amplify. Use SEO. Use network effects. Use the platform. Make discovery inevitable.

But here's what I want you to hear most clearly: this isn't about changing who you are or what you do. Your voice stays your voice. Your approach stays your approach. Your relationships stay your relationships. Your book continues. Your pastoral work continues. Your teaching continues. Your network work continues. Nothing changes about the work itself. What changes is how that work multiplies. What changes is how people discover it. What changes is how it all fits together.

You wrote a book that mattered in 2007. You've been doing the work ever since. You've been developing insights, refining frameworks, learning from the chaos. Now it's time to build the platform that lets that work multiply. It's time to create the ecosystem where your content works together. It's time to turn your quiet digital presence into a living conversation about intuitive leadership in a world that needs it more than ever.

This is your next season, Tim. Not more content creation—content capture. Not more work—work that works harder. Not more platforms—a platform that brings it all together. The foundation is built. The book is written. The work is being done. The content exists. Now it's time to connect it all and watch it multiply.

And that's exactly what intuitive leadership does: it multiplies. It creates narratives. It uses metaphors. It embraces chaos. It connects. It amplifies. It serves.

This is the work. This is the narrative. This is the metaphor. This is the chaos, embraced. And it's time your work started multiplying the same way you've been leading: intuitively, narratively, metaphorically, embracing the chaos and turning it into something that serves.
