**Research Date**: January 4, 2026  
**Confidence Level**: Medium-High

## Executive Summary

Tim Keel is the founding pastor of Jacob's Well, a church in Kansas City, Missouri, and the author of "Intuitive Leadership: Embracing a Paradigm of Narrative, Metaphor, and Chaos" (Baker Publishing Group, 2007). He has served on the board of directors for Emergent Village, a Christian network organization. Keel's work focuses on intuitive leadership, narrative theology, and creative approaches to church leadership in the context of cultural shifts.
