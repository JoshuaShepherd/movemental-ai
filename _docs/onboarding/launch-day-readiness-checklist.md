# Launch Day Readiness Checklist
## What Leaders Need on Launch Day (Based on Book Framework)

**Purpose**: Operationalize the book's framework into concrete launch requirements. Ensures leaders launch with scenius credibility, voice preservation, transparency, and network amplification—not just a live website.

**Audience**: Onboarding coordinators, internal team, leaders preparing for launch

**Status**: Foundational Document - Pre-Scale

**Based on**: Book framework (scenius, voice preservation, transparency, 70/30 rule, networked credibility)

## Core Principle: Launch Demonstrates Networked Credibility

**The Book's Core Argument**: "The future belongs to leaders who embed their work in networks of verified humans while using AI as a tool for amplification, not replacement."

**Launch Day Must Demonstrate**:
- ✅ Leader is embedded in a network (scenius credibility)
- ✅ Work is verified by other humans (network verification)
- ✅ AI amplifies voice (voice preservation)
- ✅ Transparency about AI usage (honest disclosure)
- ✅ Content serves formation (not extraction)

**The Difference**: Launch isn't "Brad's site is live." It's "Brad is now part of a verified network that amplifies credible voices in an AI-saturated world."

## MUST HAVE: Credibility Essentials

### 1. Network Verification Visible

**From the Book**: "Scenius means: You publish alongside other verified experts. You reference each other's work in visible, indexed ways. Your credibility is vouched for by other credible people."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Network connections visible on site** (links to Alan, other network members)
- [ ] **Cross-references in first articles** (references to other network members' work)
- [ ] **Network/Scenius section** (shows verified relationships, network members)
- [ ] **Network verification badge/indicator** (shows leader is part of verified network)
- [ ] **At least one network member's visible endorsement** (cross-link, quote, or collaboration)

**Why This Matters**: In an AI-saturated world, individual credibility is invisible. Network verification is what AI can't fake.

**How to Verify**:
- Site includes "Network" or "Scenius" section with other leaders
- First article(s) include cross-references to other network members
- Network verification indicator visible (badge, footer, about page)
- At least one other leader has linked to or endorsed the launch

---

### 2. Voice-Preserved Content

**From the Book**: "Specialized AI agents that preserve voice and theological integrity while enabling sustainable content creation."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **2-3 published articles** that demonstrate authentic voice
- [ ] **AI agents trained on leader's voice** (voice baseline established, voice fingerprint created)
- [ ] **Content sounds like leader** (not generic AI, not homogenized)
- [ ] **Voice authenticity visible** (readers can tell it's the leader's voice)
- [ ] **Voice & Vocation Coach active** (analyzing voice coherence against 5 markers)

**Why This Matters**: Voice preservation is non-negotiable. Launch content must demonstrate authentic voice, not AI homogenization.

**How to Verify**:
- Review published articles: Do they sound like the leader?
- Voice baseline table populated with content samples
- Voice fingerprint generated and stored
- Voice & Vocation Coach reports voice coherence scores
- Leader confirms: "This sounds like me"

---

### 3. Transparency Infrastructure

**From the Book**: "Honest disclosure about AI usage builds trust. The credibility advantage of transparency."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **AI disclosure on published content** ("This article was created with AI assistance using the 70/30 rule")
- [ ] **Transparency page** (explains AI usage approach, voice preservation commitment)
- [ ] **Visible commitment to human agency** (AI amplifies, doesn't replace)
- [ ] **Disclosure shows AI amplifies** (not replaces, not generates without human input)
- [ ] **Transparency about network** (how scenius credibility works, why it matters)

**Why This Matters**: Transparency builds trust in an untrustworthy environment. Hiding AI usage undermines credibility.

**How to Verify**:
- Published articles include AI disclosure (footer, metadata, or inline)
- Transparency page exists and explains AI usage
- Clear statement: "AI amplifies my voice, doesn't replace it"
- Network transparency: How scenius works, why network verification matters

---

### 4. Network Connections Active

**From the Book**: "You reference each other's work in visible, indexed ways. Your credibility is vouched for by other credible people."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Cross-references in content** (links to other network members' work)
- [ ] **Collaborative elements visible** (co-authored content, shared resources, network features)
- [ ] **Network discovery enabled** (readers can find other network members from leader's site)
- [ ] **Network amplification active** (leader's content amplified through network)
- [ ] **Intellectual lineage visible** (who influences whom, transparent relationships)

**Why This Matters**: Network connections create credibility AI can't fake. Visible relationships build trust.

**How to Verify**:
- First articles include links to other network members
- "Related Leaders" or "Network" section shows connections
- Network discovery features work (readers can navigate to other leaders)
- Cross-promotion active (other leaders' content featured)

---

### 5. Content That Moves (Formation, Not Extraction)

**From the Book**: "Content that moves: Ethical shift, not marketing trick. Transformation, not just engagement."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Content serves formation** (discipleship, theological depth, movemental purpose)
- [ ] **Not just content** (content that transforms, not just engages)
- [ ] **Clear movemental purpose** (not vanity metrics, not extraction)
- [ ] **Content aligned with calling** (serves movement, not individual platform)
- [ ] **Formation-oriented** (discipleship, theological integrity, movemental impact)

**Why This Matters**: The book distinguishes between content that moves (formation) and content that manipulates (extraction). Launch content must demonstrate the former.

**How to Verify**:
- Review published articles: Do they serve formation or extraction?
- Content demonstrates movemental purpose (not just personal branding)
- Clear alignment with theological/movemental calling
- Content serves discipleship, not just engagement

---

## SHOULD HAVE: Amplification Essentials

### 6. Network Discovery & Cross-Promotion

**From the Book**: "Network effects multiply reach. The math is clear: a single author reaches 25K-50K people; the same author in a 100-person network reaches 400K-600K people."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Network discovery features** (readers can find other network members from leader's site)
- [ ] **Cross-promotion active** (other leaders' content featured, recommended)
- [ ] **Network amplification visible** (leader's content amplified through network)
- [ ] **Collaborative opportunities** (co-authored content, shared resources, network events)
- [ ] **Network benefits visible** (why network matters, how it amplifies)

**Why This Matters**: Individual platforms can't compete with network effects. Launch must demonstrate network amplification, not isolation.

**How to Verify**:
- Network discovery features work (readers can navigate to other leaders)
- Other leaders' content featured on leader's site
- Network amplification metrics visible (if available)
- Collaborative elements active (co-authored content, shared resources)

---

### 7. Sustainable Workflow (70/30 Rule Demonstrated)

**From the Book**: "70% AI draft, 30% human refinement. The sustainable content creation model (5-hour/week)."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Evidence of sustainable workflow** (not exhausting, not a sprint)
- [ ] **Content demonstrates efficiency** (without compromising authenticity)
- [ ] **Clear that this is sustainable** (long-term, not aspirational)
- [ ] **Workflow enables 5-hour/week** (content creation is achievable)
- [ ] **70/30 rule visible** (AI assists, human refines, sustainable model)

**Why This Matters**: The book positions the 70/30 rule as the sustainable model. Launch must demonstrate this is achievable, not aspirational.

**How to Verify**:
- Leader confirms workflow is sustainable (not exhausting)
- Content demonstrates efficiency (AI-assisted, human-refined)
- Clear that this is long-term sustainable (not a sprint)
- Workflow documentation shows 5-hour/week model is achievable

---

### 8. Theological Integrity (Specialized Agents)

**From the Book**: "AI assistance must align with movemental theology. The role of human oversight and verification."

**Launch Day Requirements**:
- [ ] **Specialized agents trained** (on movemental theology, leader's theological positions)
- [ ] **Theological integrity verified** (content aligns with movemental theology)
- [ ] **Human oversight active** (theological content reviewed by leader)
- [ ] **Theological frameworks embedded** (in AI systems, in content creation)
- [ ] **Theological accuracy maintained** (content is theologically sound)

**Why This Matters**: For Christian leaders, theological integrity is non-negotiable. AI must serve theological accuracy, not compromise it.

**How to Verify**:
- Specialized agents trained on movemental theology
- Theological integrity agent active (if available)
- Leader confirms theological accuracy of published content
- Content demonstrates theological alignment
