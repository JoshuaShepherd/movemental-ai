## Purpose of the Onboarding Path Overview

The Onboarding Path Overview shows visitors what happens after they confirm fit and understand why Movemental exists. It answers the question: **"What happens if I'm a fit?"**

This page is not a tutorial or checklist. It is a high-level overview that makes the process visible and reduces anxiety.

## The Stages: From "Fit Confirmed" to "Live on Platform"

### The Journey

The onboarding path shows the stages from "fit confirmed" to "live on platform" in **3-4 weeks**:

1. **Fit Confirmed** → Visitor has passed the Fit Check (movemental leader evaluation)
2. **Understanding Established** → Visitor has read "Why Movemental"
3. **Phase 1: Discovery & Vision (Week 1)** → Core identity questions, movement context, business model alignment
4. **Phase 2: Content Research (Week 1-2)** → Automated content analysis, network intelligence, content strategy brief
5. **Phase 3: Platform Architecture (Week 2)** → Platform requirements, AI integration, feature configuration
6. **Phase 4: Network Integration & Launch (Week 3-4)** → Network onboarding, cross-promotion strategy, platform launch
7. **Go Live** → Platform launches with content, not empty templates

**Note**: Specific stages and details are implementation details, not structural requirements. The process is movement-first, evidence-based, prototype-driven, and launch-ready.

### Why Stages Matter

Stages make the process visible. Visitors can see:

- **Where they are** → Current stage in the process
- **What's next** → Next stage in the process
- **How long it takes** → Estimated time for each stage
- **What's required** → Requirements for each stage

## Why Visibility of Process Matters More Than Detail

### The Anxiety Problem

When visitors don't know what happens next, they experience anxiety:

- **Uncertainty** → "What happens after I sign up?"
- **Fear** → "Will this be complicated?"
- **Doubt** → "Can I actually do this?"
- **Overwhelm** → "This seems like a lot"

This anxiety prevents action. Visitors who are anxious do not proceed.

### How Visibility Reduces Anxiety

Visibility of process reduces anxiety by:

1. **Showing the path** → Visitors can see the entire journey
2. **Setting expectations** → Visitors know what to expect
3. **Providing milestones** → Visitors can track progress
4. **Reducing unknowns** → Visitors know what's coming

**Visibility is more important than detail.** Visitors don't need to know every step—they need to know the path exists and is manageable.

### Why Detail Can Increase Anxiety

Too much detail can increase anxiety:

- **Overwhelm** → Too many steps feel impossible
- **Complexity** → Detailed processes feel complicated
- **Perfectionism** → Detailed requirements feel like barriers

**Less detail, more visibility.** Show the path, not every step.

## How This Page Reduces Anxiety and Increases Trust

### Reducing Anxiety

The Onboarding Path Overview reduces anxiety by:

- **Making the invisible visible** → The process is no longer a black box
- **Showing it's manageable** → The path is clear and achievable
- **Providing control** → Visitors can see their progress
- **Setting expectations** → Visitors know what to expect

### Increasing Trust

The Onboarding Path Overview increases trust by:

- **Transparency** → The process is visible, not hidden
- **Honesty** → The process is shown as it is, not oversimplified
- **Clarity** → The process is clear, not confusing
- **Commitment** → Showing the process demonstrates commitment to the visitor

**Trust comes from transparency, not perfection.** A visible process with clear stages builds more trust than a perfect process that is hidden.

## Why This Is Not a Tutorial or Checklist

### What It Is Not

The Onboarding Path Overview is not:

- **A tutorial** → It does not teach how to use the platform
- **A checklist** → It does not list every step or task
- **A guide** → It does not provide detailed instructions
- **A manual** → It does not explain how things work

### What It Is

The Onboarding Path Overview is:

- **A map** → It shows the journey from start to finish
- **An overview** → It provides high-level visibility of the process
- **A reassurance** → It shows that the process exists and is manageable
- **A trust-builder** → It demonstrates transparency and commitment

### Why the Distinction Matters

Tutorials and checklists are for **doing**. The Onboarding Path Overview is for **understanding**.

Visitors need to understand the process before they do it. Understanding reduces anxiety and builds trust. Doing comes later, in the actual onboarding process.

## Structural Position

### Where It Lives

The Onboarding Path Overview is a **supporting page** that visitors encounter after understanding "Why Movemental." It may be:

- A dedicated page (e.g., `/onboarding`)
- A section within another page
- A modal or overlay

**It is not optional.** It is a required structural component for visitors who have confirmed fit.

### Relationship to Other Components

- **Before**: Fit Check, Why Movemental
- **After**: Team/Credibility, AI Book, Learning Hub, Pricing/Access

The Onboarding Path Overview provides context for what happens after understanding. It bridges the gap between understanding and action.

---

## What This Page Does Not Include

This page does not include:

- **Detailed instructions** → Instructions are in tutorials and guides
- **Step-by-step tasks** → Tasks are in the actual onboarding process
- **Feature explanations** → Features are explained elsewhere
- **Technical details** → Technical details are in documentation

This page focuses solely on **visibility of process** and **reduction of anxiety**.

---

## Summary

The Onboarding Path Overview:

- **Shows the stages** → From "fit confirmed" to "live on platform"
- **Makes the process visible** → Visitors can see the entire journey
- **Reduces anxiety** → Visibility reduces uncertainty and fear
- **Increases trust** → Transparency builds trust
- **Is not a tutorial** → It is a map, not a guide

This page is structural because it bridges understanding and action. Visitors who understand the process are more likely to proceed. Visitors who don't understand the process are more likely to exit.
