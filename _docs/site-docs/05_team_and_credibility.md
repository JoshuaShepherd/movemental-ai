## Purpose of the Team Page

The Team page (also called "People" or "About Us") serves a specific structural purpose: **it collapses trust questions quickly**.

Visitors who are considering Movemental need to know: "Who are these people and why should I trust them?"

The Team page answers this question directly, without requiring visitors to dig through content, read bios, or piece together credibility from scattered sources.

## Why Embodied Credibility Matters

### The Credibility Problem

In a world of anonymous platforms and faceless brands, visitors need to know:

- **Who is behind this?** → Real people or a faceless corporation?
- **Do they know what they're doing?** → Experience, expertise, authority
- **Can I trust them?** → Integrity, alignment, track record
- **Are they like me?** → Shared values, similar journey, relatable

**Credibility is not automatic.** It must be established. The Team page establishes it.

### Why Embodiment Matters

**Embodied credibility** means credibility that comes from real people, not just credentials or institutions.

Visitors trust:

- **People they can see** → Photos, videos, personal presence
- **People they can relate to** → Shared experiences, similar journeys
- **People who are authentic** → Real stories, genuine presence
- **People who demonstrate expertise** → Through action, not just credentials

**Institutional credibility** (degrees, certifications, awards) matters, but it is secondary to embodied credibility.

## Why This Page Collapses Trust Questions Quickly

### The Trust Question

Visitors have a trust question: "Should I trust Movemental?"

This question can be answered in two ways:

1. **Slowly** → Through scattered content, testimonials, case studies, social proof
2. **Quickly** → Through a dedicated Team page that shows who is behind Movemental

### How the Team Page Collapses the Question

The Team page collapses the trust question by:

1. **Showing real people** → Photos, names, roles, presence
2. **Demonstrating expertise** → Experience, authority, track record
3. **Providing context** → Why they're here, what they care about
4. **Creating connection** → Relatable stories, shared values

**One page, one question answered.** Visitors don't need to dig through content to understand who is behind Movemental.

### Why Speed Matters

Trust questions that linger create friction:

- **Uncertainty** → "I'm not sure I can trust this"
- **Delay** → "I'll think about it later"
- **Exit** → "I'll look elsewhere"

**Collapsing the trust question quickly removes friction.** Visitors who trust Movemental proceed. Visitors who don't trust Movemental exit. Either way, the question is answered quickly.

## The Roles Represented

### Builder

The **Builder** is the person or team who built Movemental. They demonstrate:

- **Technical expertise** → Ability to build the platform
- **Vision** → Understanding of the problem and solution
- **Commitment** → Investment in creating Movemental
- **Capability** → Skills to maintain and improve the platform

**Why it matters**: Visitors need to know that Movemental is built by capable people who understand the problem.

### Movement Authority

The **Movement Authority** is the person or team who has authority in the movement space. They demonstrate:

- **Domain expertise** → Deep understanding of movements and content
- **Track record** → History of creating content that moves
- **Credibility** → Recognition and respect in the movement community
- **Alignment** → Shared values and goals with Movemental

**Why it matters**: Visitors need to know that Movemental is guided by people who understand movements.

### Practitioner

The **Practitioner** is the person or team who uses Movemental to create content. They demonstrate:

- **Real-world usage** → Actual experience using the platform
- **Results** → Content that has moved people
- **Relatability** → Similar journey to potential users
- **Authenticity** → Genuine experience, not marketing

**Why it matters**: Visitors need to know that Movemental is used by real people who create real results.

### Note on Roles

Not all roles need to be represented. The Team page should show:

- **Who is essential** → People who are critical to Movemental's credibility
- **Who is relevant** → People who visitors need to know about
- **Who is relatable** → People who visitors can connect with

**Less is more.** A focused Team page with essential people is more credible than a long list of names.

## Why Relational Credibility > Institutional Branding

### The Traditional Approach

Traditional platforms rely on **institutional branding**:

- **Company name** → Brand recognition
- **Logo and design** → Visual identity
- **Credentials** → Awards, certifications, partnerships
- **Social proof** → Testimonials, case studies, numbers

**This works, but it's slow.** Visitors must piece together credibility from multiple sources.

### The Movemental Approach

Movemental relies on **relational credibility**:

- **Real people** → Names, faces, stories
- **Personal presence** → Photos, videos, authentic voice
- **Direct connection** → Visitors can see who is behind Movemental
- **Embodied expertise** → Expertise demonstrated through people, not just credentials

**This works faster.** Visitors can see credibility immediately on the Team page.

### Why Relational Credibility Works Better

Relational credibility works better because:

1. **It's faster** → One page answers the trust question
2. **It's more authentic** → Real people are more trustworthy than brands
3. **It's more relatable** → Visitors can connect with people, not institutions
4. **It's more memorable** → People are remembered more than brands

**Institutional branding supports relational credibility, but relational credibility is primary.**

## Structural Position

### Where It Lives

The Team page is a **supporting page** that visitors encounter after understanding "Why Movemental" and the onboarding path. It may be:

- A dedicated page (e.g., `/team` or `/people`)
- A section within an "About" page
- Linked from multiple places for easy access

**It is not optional.** It is a required structural component.

### Relationship to Other Components

- **Before**: Fit Check, Why Movemental, Onboarding Path
- **After**: AI Book, Learning Hub, Pricing/Access

The Team page provides credibility that supports all other pages. Visitors who trust the team are more likely to engage with the AI book, learning hub, and pricing.

---

## What This Page Does Not Include

This page does not include:

- **Detailed bios** → Bios can be linked, but the page should focus on roles and credibility
- **Company history** → History is less important than current team
- **Organizational charts** → Structure is less important than people
- **Marketing copy** → This is structural documentation, not marketing

This page focuses solely on **who is behind Movemental** and **why they should be trusted**.

---

## Summary

The Team page:

- **Collapses trust questions quickly** → One page answers "Who are these people?"
- **Demonstrates embodied credibility** → Real people, not just credentials
- **Shows essential roles** → Builder, Movement Authority, Practitioner
- **Prioritizes relational credibility** → People over institutional branding

This page is structural because trust is foundational. Visitors who trust the team proceed. Visitors who don't trust the team exit. The Team page ensures this question is answered quickly.
