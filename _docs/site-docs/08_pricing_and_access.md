## Purpose of the Pricing Page

The Pricing page (also called "Access" or "Plans") shows visitors what it costs to get a Movemental platform and what the revenue model is. It answers the questions: **"What does it cost?"** and **"How does revenue sharing work?"**

This page comes after understanding because pricing only makes sense in context. Visitors who don't understand Movemental's purpose (platform ownership, revenue retention, network effects) cannot evaluate whether the pricing model is worth it.

## Why Pricing Comes After Understanding

### The Context Problem

Pricing without context is meaningless:

- **"$X per month"** → Is that expensive or cheap?
- **"Feature Y included"** → Is that feature valuable?
- **"Limit of Z users"** → Is that limit reasonable?

**Without understanding Movemental's purpose, visitors cannot evaluate pricing.**

### The Sequence

Pricing should be encountered after:

1. **Fit Check** → Visitor knows they're a fit
2. **Why Movemental** → Visitor understands the problem and solution
3. **Onboarding Path** → Visitor understands what they're getting
4. **Team/Credibility** → Visitor trusts the people behind Movemental
5. **AI Book** → Visitor understands the knowledge foundation
6. **Learning Hub** → Visitor understands what they can learn

**Then pricing makes sense.** Visitors can evaluate whether the price is worth it because they understand what they're buying.

### Why This Order Matters

**Understanding before pricing creates alignment.** Visitors who understand Movemental's purpose can evaluate pricing in context. Visitors who don't understand will either:

- **Overvalue** → Pay for something they don't understand
- **Undervalue** → Reject pricing because they don't see the value
- **Misalign** → Expect outcomes that Movemental cannot deliver

**Pricing after understanding prevents misalignment.**

## The Pricing Model: $1,000 + 10% Revenue Share

### The Revolutionary Pricing Structure

Movemental's pricing model is intentionally revolutionary:

- **$1,000 upfront** → Covers platform build and deployment (vs. $50K-$150K industry standard)
- **10% revenue share** → Movemental earns recurring income based on client's content subscriptions, course sales, ebooks, etc.
- **90% revenue retention** → Movemental leaders keep 90% of revenue (vs. 10% from traditional publishers, 15% on digital platforms)

**This pricing deliberately undervalues what would otherwise be six-figure agency-level work.** The strategy is:
- **Missional commitment** → Serving movemental leaders who otherwise could not afford these tools
- **Proof through scale** → Rapidly build a portfolio of 20-50 functioning, real-world use cases
- **Long-term upside** → Revenue sharing, subscriptions, and consulting multiply returns as credibility compounds

### Why This Model Works

The pricing model acts as a flywheel:

- **Low barrier to entry** → $1,000 is accessible to movemental leaders
- **High adoption** → Revolutionary pricing drives rapid adoption
- **Network effects** → More platforms create more network value
- **Reputation growth** → Success stories build credibility
- **Increasing high-value referrals** → Satisfied leaders refer others

### Why Revenue Sharing Matters

Revenue sharing aligns incentives:

- **Scales with client success** → Movemental earns more when clients succeed
- **Long-term partnership** → Both parties benefit from sustained success
- **Sustainable model** → Movemental can support clients without high upfront fees
- **Proven track record** → Demonstrates confidence in the platform's value

**Revenue sharing is not extraction—it's alignment.** Movemental succeeds when movemental leaders succeed.

## Why Urgency and Hype Are Intentionally Avoided

### The Urgency Problem

Many platforms use urgency to drive action:

- **"Limited time offer"** → Creates false scarcity
- **"Only 3 spots left"** → Creates artificial pressure
- **"Act now or miss out"** → Creates fear of missing out

**Urgency creates misalignment.** Visitors who act out of urgency, not understanding, are not aligned.

### The Hype Problem

Many platforms use hype to drive interest:

- **"Revolutionary"** → Overstates capabilities
- **"Game-changing"** → Creates unrealistic expectations
- **"The best"** → Makes unverifiable claims

**Hype creates misalignment.** Visitors who are attracted by hype, not understanding, are not aligned.

### Why Movemental Avoids Urgency and Hype

Movemental avoids urgency and hype because:

1. **It creates misalignment** → Visitors who act out of urgency or hype are not aligned
2. **It undermines credibility** → Urgency and hype erode trust
3. **It attracts the wrong users** → Urgency and hype attract users who are not a fit
4. **It creates poor outcomes** → Misaligned users create poor outcomes

**Movemental prioritizes alignment over action.** Better to have fewer aligned users than many misaligned users.

### How Movemental Presents Pricing

Movemental presents pricing:

- **Transparently** → Clear pricing, no hidden costs
- **Honestly** → Accurate representation of value
- **Calmly** → No urgency, no pressure
- **Contextually** → Pricing in context of understanding

**Pricing that respects the visitor's intelligence and time.**

## Structural Position

### Where It Lives

The Pricing page is a **supporting page** that visitors encounter after understanding Movemental's purpose. It may be:

- A dedicated page (e.g., `/pricing` or `/access`)
- A section within another page
- Linked from multiple places for easy access

**It is not optional.** It is a required structural component.

### Relationship to Other Components

- **Before**: Fit Check, Why Movemental, Onboarding Path, Team/Credibility, AI Book, Learning Hub
- **After**: Homepage, sign-up, or exit

The Pricing page comes after understanding because pricing only makes sense in context. Visitors who understand Movemental can evaluate pricing. Visitors who don't understand cannot.

## What This Page Does Not Include

This document does not specify:

- **Specific prices** → Actual pricing is an implementation detail
- **Pricing tiers** → Number and structure of tiers is an implementation detail
- **Payment methods** → How payment is processed is an implementation detail
- **Billing cycles** → Monthly, annual, etc. is an implementation detail

This document focuses solely on **the structural role** of pricing and why it comes after understanding.

---

## Summary

The Pricing page:

- **Comes after understanding** → Pricing only makes sense in context
- **Shows limits clearly** → Specific limits set expectations and build trust
- **Avoids urgency and hype** → Prioritizes alignment over action
- **Presents transparently** → Clear, honest, calm, contextual pricing

This page is structural because pricing is a decision point. Visitors who understand Movemental can evaluate pricing. Visitors who don't understand cannot. The Pricing page ensures this decision is made with understanding.
