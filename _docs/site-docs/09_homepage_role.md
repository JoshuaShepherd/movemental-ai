# Homepage Role

> **The Homepage as a router, not a meaning-maker**

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2026

## Purpose of the Homepage

The Homepage is not where meaning is made. It is a **router**—a navigation hub that directs visitors to the places where understanding is actually built.

**The Homepage assumes prior understanding.** It does not create understanding. It directs visitors who already understand (or are ready to understand) to the right places.

---

## The Four Jobs the Homepage Performs

### 1. Wayfinding

The Homepage helps visitors **find their way** to the right pages:

- **Navigation** → Clear links to key pages (Fit Check, Why Movemental, etc.)
- **Organization** → Logical grouping of related pages
- **Clarity** → Clear labels and descriptions
- **Accessibility** → Easy to find what you're looking for

**Wayfinding assumes visitors know what they're looking for.** The Homepage helps them find it.

### 2. Re-entry Point

The Homepage serves as a **re-entry point** for returning visitors:

- **Familiar landing** → Visitors know where they are
- **Quick access** → Easy access to frequently used pages
- **Progress tracking** → Shows where visitors are in their journey
- **Continuity** → Maintains context across visits

**Re-entry assumes visitors have been here before.** The Homepage helps them continue their journey.

### 3. Status Display

The Homepage shows **current status** and **what's available**:

- **Featured content** → What's new or important
- **Platform status** → What's available and what's not
- **Updates** → Recent changes or announcements
- **Opportunities** → What visitors can do next

**Status display assumes visitors understand the context.** The Homepage shows what's available, not what it means.

### 4. Quick Access

The Homepage provides **quick access** to common actions:

- **Sign up** → For visitors ready to proceed
- **Log in** → For returning users
- **Search** → For visitors looking for specific content
- **Contact** → For visitors who need help

**Quick access assumes visitors know what they want to do.** The Homepage helps them do it quickly.

## What It Intentionally Does Not Do

### It Does Not Explain What Movemental Is

The Homepage does not explain:

- **What Movemental is** → That's in "Why Movemental"
- **What problem it solves** → That's in "Why Movemental"
- **How it works** → That's in the Learning Hub
- **Who it's for** → That's in the Fit Check

**The Homepage assumes visitors have encountered these explanations elsewhere** (or will encounter them through navigation).

### It Does Not Create Understanding

The Homepage does not:

- **Educate** → Education happens in the AI Book and Learning Hub
- **Persuade** → Persuasion happens in "Why Movemental"
- **Onboard** → Onboarding happens in the Onboarding Path
- **Build trust** → Trust is built in the Team page

**The Homepage directs visitors to where understanding is created, but it does not create understanding itself.**

### It Does Not Make Meaning

The Homepage does not:

- **Tell the story** → The story is in "Why Movemental"
- **Establish context** → Context is established in earlier pages
- **Create alignment** → Alignment is created through the sequence of pages
- **Build relationships** → Relationships are built through engagement

**The Homepage is a router, not a meaning-maker.**

## Why It Should Be Built Last

### The Dependency Problem

The Homepage depends on all other pages:

- **It links to other pages** → Cannot be built until other pages exist
- **It shows status** → Cannot show status until features exist
- **It provides access** → Cannot provide access until functionality exists
- **It assumes understanding** → Cannot assume understanding until understanding is created elsewhere

**The Homepage is the last piece because it connects everything else.**

### The Sequence

Pages should be built in this order:

1. **Fit Check** → Built first
2. **Why Movemental** → Built second
3. **Onboarding Path** → Built third
4. **Team/Credibility** → Built fourth
5. **AI Book** → Built fifth
6. **Learning Hub** → Built sixth
7. **Pricing/Access** → Built seventh
8. **Homepage** → Built last

**The Homepage is built last because it assumes all other pages exist.**

### Why This Order Matters

**Building the Homepage last ensures:**

- **All links work** → Other pages exist to link to
- **Navigation makes sense** → Navigation reflects the actual structure
- **Status is accurate** → Status reflects actual features and content
- **Understanding is assumed** → Homepage can assume visitors understand because understanding is created elsewhere

**The Homepage is the capstone, not the foundation.**

## How the Homepage Serves the Structure

### It Reflects the Structure

The Homepage reflects the site's structure:

- **Primary navigation** → Links to foundational pages (Fit Check, Why Movemental, etc.)
- **Secondary navigation** → Links to supporting pages (Team, Learning Hub, etc.)
- **Organization** → Grouping reflects the order of understanding
- **Hierarchy** → Visual hierarchy reflects importance

**The Homepage is a map of the structure, not the structure itself.**

### It Supports the Sequence

The Homepage supports the sequence of understanding:

- **Guides new visitors** → Directs them to Fit Check and "Why Movemental"
- **Supports returning visitors** → Provides quick access to where they left off
- **Respects the order** → Does not bypass the sequence
- **Enables navigation** → Makes it easy to follow the sequence

**The Homepage serves the sequence, it does not replace it.**

### It Assumes Understanding

The Homepage assumes visitors understand:

- **What Movemental is** → Because they've read "Why Movemental"
- **Whether they're a fit** → Because they've completed the Fit Check
- **What to expect** → Because they've seen the Onboarding Path
- **Who to trust** → Because they've seen the Team page

**The Homepage assumes understanding, it does not create it.**

## Structural Position

### Where It Lives

The Homepage is the **entry point** for the site, but it is not the **starting point** for understanding. It may be:

- The root URL (e.g., `/`)
- The default landing page
- The navigation hub

**It is not optional.** It is a required structural component, but it is built last.

### Relationship to Other Components

- **Before**: Nothing (it's the entry point)
- **After**: All other pages (it links to everything)

The Homepage connects all other pages. It is the hub, but the meaning is in the spokes.

## What This Page Does Not Include

This document does not specify:

- **Specific design** → UI/UX of the Homepage is an implementation detail
- **Content organization** → How content is organized on the Homepage is an implementation detail
- **Feature lists** → What features are shown is an implementation detail
- **Marketing copy** → This is structural documentation, not marketing

This document focuses solely on **the role and function** of the Homepage as a router.

---

## Summary

The Homepage:

- **Is a router, not a meaning-maker** → It directs visitors, it does not educate them
- **Performs four jobs** → Wayfinding, re-entry, status display, quick access
- **Intentionally does not explain** → It assumes understanding from other pages
- **Should be built last** → It depends on all other pages existing

This page is structural because it connects everything else. The Homepage is the hub, but the meaning is in the pages it connects to. The Homepage assumes understanding—it does not create it.
