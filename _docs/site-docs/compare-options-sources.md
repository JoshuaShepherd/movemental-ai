# Compare Your Options Page — Sources

**Page:** `/compare`  
**Purpose:** Help visitors see their real options (Movemental, agency, course platforms, Substack) with cost and features—show, don't tell. Movemental first; scenius called out as what only we provide.

---

## Agency (custom development)

- **Cost:** User requested ~$175,000; docs and research use $50K–$150K as typical range for custom platform/website.
- **Sources:**
  - GoodFirms / Clutch: custom web development often $3K–$150K+; enterprise/platform work $100K–$500K+.
  - Clutch: average project ~$66K; many projects 9+ months.
  - Custom platform / "SaaS-style" or content platform: commonly $25K–$150K; complex builds higher.
- **Ongoing:** 10–20% of initial build cost per year for maintenance (common industry range).
- **What you get:** Custom design and build, strategy if scoped, ownership of the delivered site. No built-in peer network or scenius.

## Course platforms (Thinkific, Teachable, Kajabi)

- **Thinkific:** $49–$199/mo (Basic, Start, Grow; Plus custom). 0% transaction fees on paid plans. Free plan: 1 course, unlimited students. (thinkific.com/pricing; SupplyGem on transaction fees.)
- **Teachable:** $39–$249/mo (Starter 7.5% transaction fee; Builder/Growth/Advanced 0%). Payment processing 2.9%+$0.30 (US). (teachable.com/pricing; support.teachable.com fees.)
- **Kajabi:** ~$89–$399/mo (Kickstarter, Basic, Growth, Pro). No transaction fees; all-in-one marketing/courses. (Kajabi pricing; comparison guides 2024–2025.)
- **Revenue retention:** After platform fees + payment processing, creators often keep ~70–85% vs. Movemental's 90%. Traditional publishers ~10%.
- **What you get:** Hosting, courses, sometimes blog/landing; custom domain often available. You do not get: platform ownership, audience data ownership, or a movement peer network/scenius.

## Substack (writer / newsletter platforms)

- **Cost:** Free to publish; 10% of paid subscription revenue when paid is enabled.
- **Stripe fees:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (US); 0.7% billing fee for recurring subscriptions (as of July 2024).
- **Revenue retention:** Creators keep ~85–87% after Substack + Stripe; comparable to Movemental's 90% after platform share.
- **Audience:** Creators own subscriber email list; can export at any time. (support.substack.com; Substack Writer FAQ.)
- **What you get:** Newsletter/articles, optional paid subscriptions, custom domain. You do not get: platform ownership (you publish on Substack), books or courses as products, scenius, or voice-preserving AI.
- **Discovery:** Recommendations feature and discovery tab are algorithm-driven.

## How the table is built

- Rows are grouped by: Cost & pricing, Digital playbook, Platform, Network & scenius, Launch & support.
- Columns: Movemental | Agency | Course platforms | Substack.
- Movemental column is first and highlighted (emerald) so the page leads with "what you get with us."
- Cells use "Included"/"—" for booleans and short text for costs/timelines.
- "The part they can't give you" section states that the scenius (and the people in it, including Alan & Brad) is only with Movemental—show it in the table, then say it plainly once.
- Substack deep-dive: `/compare/substack` provides an honest guide for people deciding between Substack and Movemental.
