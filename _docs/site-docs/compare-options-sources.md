# Compare Your Options Page — Sources

**Page:** `/compare`  
**Purpose:** Help visitors see their real options (Movemental, agency, SaaS) with cost and features—show, don’t tell. Movemental first; scenius called out as what only we provide.

---

## Agency (custom development)

- **Cost:** User requested ~$175,000; docs and research use $50K–$150K as typical range for custom platform/website.
- **Sources:**
  - GoodFirms / Clutch: custom web development often $3K–$150K+; enterprise/platform work $100K–$500K+.
  - Clutch: average project ~$66K; many projects 9+ months.
  - Custom platform / “SaaS-style” or content platform: commonly $25K–$150K; complex builds higher.
- **Ongoing:** 10–20% of initial build cost per year for maintenance (common industry range).
- **What you get:** Custom design and build, strategy if scoped, ownership of the delivered site. No built-in peer network or scenius.

## SaaS (course/content platforms)

- **Thinkific:** $49–$199/mo (Basic, Start, Grow; Plus custom). 0% transaction fees on paid plans. Free plan: 1 course, unlimited students. (thinkific.com/pricing; SupplyGem on transaction fees.)
- **Teachable:** $39–$249/mo (Starter 7.5% transaction fee; Builder/Growth/Advanced 0%). Payment processing 2.9%+$0.30 (US). (teachable.com/pricing; support.teachable.com fees.)
- **Kajabi:** ~$89–$399/mo (Kickstarter, Basic, Growth, Pro). No transaction fees; all-in-one marketing/courses. (Kajabi pricing; comparison guides 2024–2025.)
- **Revenue retention:** After platform fees + payment processing, creators often keep ~70–85% vs. Movemental’s 90%. Traditional publishers ~10%.
- **What you get:** Hosting, courses, sometimes blog/landing; custom domain often available. You do not get: platform ownership, audience data ownership, or a movement peer network/scenius.

## Movemental

- **Pricing:** $1,000 upfront + 10% revenue share; leader keeps 90%. (_docs/site-docs/08_pricing_and_access.md, 03_why_movemental_longform.md.)
- **Process:** 3–4 weeks; four phases (Discovery & Vision, Content Research, Platform Architecture, Network & Launch). (lib/schemas/onboarding-path.ts; HOW-IT-WORKS-PAGES-OVERVIEW.md.)
- **Playbook & credibility:** One home, author legible (E-E-A-T), content as nodes, linking/graph, restraint. (credibility-how-it-works.md.)
- **Network:** Scenius; Alan & Brad and movement leaders; bounded ecology; cross-promotion; credibility graph. (Same docs; product/why-vs-how-reframe.md.)

## How the table is built

- Rows are grouped by: Cost & pricing, Digital playbook, Platform, Network & scenius, Launch & support.
- Movemental column is first and highlighted (emerald) so the page leads with “what you get with us.”
- Agency and SaaS cells use the research above; “Included”/“—” and short text for costs/timelines.
- “The part they can’t give you” section states that the scenius (and the people in it, including Alan & Brad) is only with Movemental—show it in the table, then say it plainly once.
