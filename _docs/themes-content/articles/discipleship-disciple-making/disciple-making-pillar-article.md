# Disciple Making: Multiplying Disciples Who Make Disciples

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
>
> —Matthew 28:19-20

> If you want to understand what makes missional movements so powerful, look no further than disciple-making. At the most uncomplicated level, missional movements never appear to get beyond disciple-making as a core practice.
>
> —Alan Hirsch, *The Forgotten Ways*

> For the follower of Jesus, discipleship must not be viewed as the first step beyond which we move to some other, more advanced destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way.
>
> —Alan Hirsch

> But even more significant, discipleship is the very task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry—the selection and development of that motley band of followers on whose shoulders the whole movement that has extended itself through the ages and into the twenty-first century would emerge from his death and resurrection.

> —Alan Hirsch

What if disciple making isn't just formation, but multiplication? What if the early church's growth from 25,000 to 20 million in just three centuries wasn't about superior programs or strategies, but about disciple making that was inherently multiplication-focused—making disciples who make disciples? What if the Methodist movement's impact wasn't about organizational excellence, but about disciple making that created multiplication capacity? What if every local church already has the potential for multiplication-focused disciple making—if only we would recognize and activate it?

These questions have shaped my journey into understanding what makes movements move. After years of studying history's most remarkable Jesus movements and working with contemporary communities seeking to multiply, I began to see patterns that couldn't be explained by programs, strategies, or leadership models alone. Something deeper was at work—a form of disciple making that was inherently multiplication-focused, making disciples who make disciples, forming communities that form communities.

That something is **disciple making**—the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission, with multiplication as its natural outcome. Disciple making isn't about adding multiplication to formation or formation to multiplication—it's about recognizing that authentic disciple making is inherently multiplication-focused, and authentic multiplication requires disciple making. When disciple making is multiplication-focused, disciple making emerges—and movement capacity is created.

## Understanding Disciple Making

**Disciple making** refers to the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission, with multiplication as its natural outcome. It's not about adding multiplication to formation or formation to multiplication—it's about recognizing that authentic disciple making is inherently multiplication-focused, and authentic multiplication requires disciple making. Disciple making forms disciples who multiply—making disciples who make disciples.

The multiplication focus of disciple making is crucial. Disciple making without multiplication becomes formation without reproduction—disciples who are formed but don't multiply. Multiplication without disciple making becomes activity without formation—multipliers who are active but aren't formed. Disciple making integrates both—disciples who are formed and multiply, who are shaped by Jesus and multiply Jesus's mission, who follow Jesus and make disciples who make disciples.

Disciple making creates movement capacity because it forms disciples who multiply. When disciples are multiplication-focused, they naturally multiply—making disciples who make disciples, forming communities that form communities, transforming neighborhoods that transform neighborhoods. This multiplication capacity is what makes movements move—disciple making that creates exponential growth.

### The Great Commission Reconsidered

The Great Commission reveals the multiplication focus of disciple making. Jesus commands us to "make disciples of all nations"—not just converts, not just church members, but disciples. And disciple making involves both formation ("teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you") and multiplication ("go therefore and make disciples"). The Great Commission integrates formation and multiplication—we make disciples by going, teaching, and forming, and those disciples make disciples.

This integration is crucial. The Great Commission doesn't separate formation from multiplication—it integrates them. We don't first make disciples and then teach them to multiply. We make disciples by teaching them to multiply. We don't first form people and then activate them. We form people by activating them to multiply. The Great Commission reveals multiplication-focused disciple making—disciple making that is inherently multiplication-oriented.

The early church demonstrated this integration. They made disciples by going, teaching, and forming. They multiplied disciples by making disciples who made disciples. They integrated formation and multiplication—disciples learned by making disciples, they grew by multiplying. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples were formed to multiply—and they did.

### Discipleship as Evangelism's Context

A critical insight from Disciplism is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

When discipleship becomes evangelism's context, everything changes. Evangelism becomes relational rather than event-based. Conversion becomes the beginning of discipleship rather than the end of evangelism. Multiplication becomes natural rather than programmatic. Disciple making emerges when discipleship is the context for evangelism—when we make disciples who naturally share the gospel because they are disciples.

The early church demonstrated this. They made disciples, and evangelism happened naturally within that process. They didn't separate evangelism from discipleship—they integrated them. Discipleship was the context for evangelism. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples naturally shared the gospel—and they did.

### Jesus-Shaped Disciple Making

Disciple making must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples. Every single aspect of the way we live out our lives needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. A dynamic, vital, living reality and response to Jesus in every moment of our lives is our most fundamental truth, and we have forgotten it to our great peril.

Jesus-shaped disciple making means following Jesus—not just learning about Jesus, not just believing in Jesus, but following Jesus. It means letting Jesus define our concepts of God, our understanding of humanity, our approach to mission. It means modeling our lives on Jesus, letting him live through us, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice.

The early church demonstrated Jesus-shaped disciple making. They followed Jesus—not just learned about him or believed in him, but followed him. They let Jesus define everything—their understanding of God, their approach to mission, their way of life. This Jesus-shaped disciple making created multiplication capacity because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply—and they did.

## Framework Foundation: Disciple Making as Movement DNA

Understanding disciple making requires grasping how it functions as core DNA of movements. Disciple making isn't optional for movements—it's essential. When disciple making is present, movements emerge. When disciple making is absent, movements cannot form. This is why disciple making is the second element of mDNA—it's the core function that creates multiplication capacity.

### The Second Element of mDNA

Disciple making is the second element of the mDNA framework—Disciple-Making. This element is essential because it creates the multiplication capacity that movements require. Without disciple making, movements cannot multiply. With disciple making, movements multiply naturally, organically, exponentially.

The order matters. Jesus is Lord comes first—it's the gravitational center. Disciple making comes second—it's the core function. When Jesus is Lord, disciple making becomes natural because following Jesus is what defines us. When disciple making is active, multiplication becomes natural because disciples multiply.

The early church demonstrated this. Jesus is Lord was central—it was the gravitational center. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who followed Jesus naturally multiplied—and they did.

### Formation and Multiplication

Disciple making involves both formation and multiplication. Formation shapes disciples—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. Multiplication spreads disciples—making disciples who make disciples. Both are essential. Formation without multiplication creates disciples who are formed but don't multiply. Multiplication without formation creates disciples who multiply but aren't formed. Disciple making integrates both—formation that enables multiplication, multiplication that requires formation.

The early church demonstrated this integration. They formed disciples—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. They multiplied disciples—making disciples who made disciples. This integration created multiplication capacity because formation enabled multiplication, and multiplication required formation.

Contemporary movements demonstrate this integration. They form disciples through intentional practices—teaching, modeling, coaching. They multiply disciples through natural relationships—disciples making disciples. This integration creates multiplication capacity because formation enables multiplication, and multiplication requires formation.

### Multiplication as DNA

In disciple making, multiplication is DNA—it's encoded in the very nature of disciple making. Disciple making isn't formation that then leads to multiplication. Disciple making is formation that is inherently multiplication-focused. Multiplication isn't activity that then requires disciple making. Multiplication is activity that requires disciple making. Multiplication and disciple making are integrated—multiplication is disciple making's DNA.

The early church demonstrated this. Multiplication was DNA—it was encoded in disciple making. Disciple making was inherently multiplication-focused—disciples were formed to multiply. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples who are multiplication-focused by nature naturally multiply—and they did.

Contemporary movements demonstrate this. Multiplication is DNA—it's encoded in disciple making. Disciple making is inherently multiplication-focused—disciples are formed to multiply. This integration creates multiplication capacity because disciples who are multiplication-focused by nature naturally multiply.

## Practical Application: Implementing Disciple Making

Implementing disciple making requires practical application of the framework. How do we actually make disciples who make disciples? What specific practices implement multiplication-focused disciple making? What steps can we take to move from formation-focused to multiplication-focused disciple making? These questions require practical guidance for implementation.

### Formation Practices

The first step in implementing disciple making is intentional formation. How do we form disciples who multiply? What practices shape multiplication-focused disciples? Formation practices must integrate discipleship and multiplication—forming disciples who multiply.

**Jesus-centered formation.** Form disciples around Jesus—his person, his story, his mission. Jesus-centered formation means letting Jesus define everything—our understanding of God, our approach to mission, our way of life. When formation is Jesus-centered, disciple making emerges because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply.

The early church practiced Jesus-centered formation. They formed disciples around Jesus—his person, his story, his mission. This formation created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice Jesus-centered formation through Jesus studies, gospel fluency, and missional practices. When we form disciples around Jesus, disciple making emerges.

**Shema spirituality.** Form disciples through Shema spirituality—loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. Shema spirituality integrates love for God and love for neighbor—creating disciples who are formed in relationship with God and sent in relationship with others. When formation includes Shema spirituality, disciple making emerges because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally multiply.

The early church practiced Shema spirituality. They formed disciples through love for God and love for neighbor. This formation created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice Shema spirituality through spiritual practices, community formation, and missional engagement. When we form disciples through Shema spirituality, disciple making emerges.

**Obedience-based learning.** Form disciples through obedience—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. Obedience-based learning means learning by doing—following Jesus in practice, not just in theory. When formation is obedience-based, disciple making emerges because disciples who obey Jesus naturally multiply.

The early church practiced obedience-based learning. They formed disciples through obedience—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. This formation created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who obey Jesus naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice obedience-based learning through missional practices, accountability, and coaching. When we form disciples through obedience, disciple making emerges.

### Multiplication Practices

The second step in implementing disciple making is intentional multiplication. How do we multiply disciples who make disciples? What practices enable multiplication? Multiplication practices must integrate discipleship and multiplication—multiplying disciples who multiply.

**Disciples making disciples.** Create systems where disciples make disciples—not just leaders making disciples, but disciples making disciples. Disciples making disciples means every disciple is a disciple-maker—every follower is a multiplier. When multiplication includes disciples making disciples, disciple making emerges because disciples who make disciples naturally multiply.

The early church practiced disciples making disciples. They created systems where disciples made disciples—every follower was a multiplier. This multiplication created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who make disciples naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice disciples making disciples through huddles, triads, and multiplication systems. When we create systems where disciples make disciples, disciple making emerges.

**Communities forming communities.** Create systems where communities form communities—not just leaders planting churches, but communities forming communities. Communities forming communities means every community is a multiplier—every gathering is a sender. When multiplication includes communities forming communities, disciple making emerges because communities that form communities naturally multiply.

The early church practiced communities forming communities. They created systems where communities formed communities—every gathering was a sender. This multiplication created multiplication-focused disciples because communities that form communities naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice communities forming communities through multiplication strategies, sending systems, and network formation. When we create systems where communities form communities, disciple making emerges.

**Leaders raising leaders.** Create systems where leaders raise leaders—not just leaders leading, but leaders raising. Leaders raising leaders means every leader is a multiplier—every shepherd is a developer. When multiplication includes leaders raising leaders, disciple making emerges because leaders who raise leaders naturally multiply.

The early church practiced leaders raising leaders. They created systems where leaders raised leaders—every shepherd was a developer. This multiplication created multiplication-focused disciples because leaders who raise leaders naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice leaders raising leaders through leadership development, coaching, and multiplication pathways. When we create systems where leaders raise leaders, disciple making emerges.

### Integration Practices

The third step in implementing disciple making is intentional integration. How do we integrate formation and multiplication? What practices create integration? Integration practices must weave formation and multiplication together—creating multiplication-focused disciple making.

**Multiplication in formation.** Include multiplication in formation—not formation then multiplication, but multiplication in formation. Multiplication in formation means disciples are formed through multiplication—they learn by making disciples, they grow by multiplying. When formation includes multiplication, disciple making emerges because disciples who are formed through multiplication naturally multiply.

The early church practiced multiplication in formation. They included multiplication in formation—disciples learned by making disciples, they grew by multiplying. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who are formed through multiplication naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice multiplication in formation through missional practices, on-the-job training, and multiplication-based learning. When we include multiplication in formation, disciple making emerges.

**Formation in multiplication.** Include formation in multiplication—not multiplication then formation, but formation in multiplication. Formation in multiplication means disciples are formed while multiplying—they grow while making disciples, they learn while serving. When multiplication includes formation, disciple making emerges because disciples who are formed in multiplication naturally multiply.

The early church practiced formation in multiplication. They included formation in multiplication—disciples grew while making disciples, they learned while serving. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples because disciples who are formed in multiplication naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice formation in multiplication through coaching, reflection, and multiplication-based formation. When we include formation in multiplication, disciple making emerges.

**Integrated rhythms.** Create integrated rhythms—not separate times for formation and multiplication, but integrated rhythms that weave them together. Integrated rhythms mean formation and multiplication happen together—disciples are formed and multiply simultaneously. When rhythms are integrated, disciple making emerges because formation and multiplication are woven together.

The early church practiced integrated rhythms. They created rhythms where formation and multiplication happened together—disciples were formed and multiplied simultaneously. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples because formation and multiplication were woven together. Contemporary movements practice integrated rhythms through missional communities, formation practices, and multiplication systems. When we create integrated rhythms, disciple making emerges.

## Case Studies: Disciple Making in Action

Understanding disciple making requires seeing it in action. Historical movements demonstrate disciple making through their practices, systems, and multiplication. Contemporary movements demonstrate disciple making through their formation, multiplication, and growth. These case studies reveal disciple making in real contexts.

### Jesus and His Disciples: The Original Model

Jesus demonstrated disciple making through his relationship with his disciples. He formed them through relationship, teaching, and modeling. He sent them on mission—first the twelve, then the seventy-two. He integrated formation and multiplication—disciples learned by following, they grew by going, they multiplied by making disciples. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples who multiplied—and they did.

Jesus's model reveals disciple making in action. Formation happened in mission—disciples learned by following Jesus on mission. Mission required formation—disciples were sent after being formed. Multiplication happened naturally—disciples made disciples because they were disciples. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally multiplied.

The early church followed Jesus's model. They formed disciples through relationship, teaching, and modeling. They sent disciples on mission—first locally, then regionally, then globally. They multiplied disciples by making disciples who made disciples. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples who multiplied—and they did.

### The Early Church: Disciple Making Under Persecution

The early church demonstrated remarkable disciple making under severe persecution. From AD 100 to 310, the church grew from approximately 25,000 to 20 million—an exponential multiplication that reveals disciple making in action. What made this possible? Disciple making—the integration of formation and multiplication that created multiplication capacity.

The early church integrated formation and multiplication. They formed disciples through teaching, community, and practices. They multiplied disciples by making disciples who made disciples. They integrated formation and multiplication—disciples learned by making disciples, they grew by multiplying. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples who multiplied—and they did.

This disciple making enabled exponential growth because it created multiplication capacity. Disciples made disciples. Communities formed communities. Leaders raised leaders. The movement grew exponentially not through programs or strategies, but through disciple making that enabled natural, organic multiplication.

### The Methodist Movement: Disciple Making Through Systems

The Methodist movement demonstrated remarkable disciple making through intentional systems. Under John Wesley's leadership, the movement grew from a small group to one in thirty people in Britain—an exponential multiplication that reveals disciple making in action. What made this possible? Disciple making—the integration of formation and multiplication enabled through intentional systems.

The Methodist movement integrated formation and multiplication through class meetings, circuit riders, and connectional systems. They formed disciples through class meetings—small groups for formation and accountability. They multiplied disciples through circuit riders—leaders who traveled and multiplied. They integrated formation and multiplication—disciples learned in class meetings, they multiplied through circuits. This integration created multiplication-focused disciples who multiplied—and they did.

This disciple making enabled exponential growth because it created multiplication capacity. Class meetings multiplied. Disciples made disciples. Leaders raised leaders. The movement grew exponentially through disciple making enabled by intentional systems.

### Contemporary Movements: Disciple Making Today

Contemporary movements demonstrate disciple making through their practices, systems, and growth. Movements like 3DM, Soma, and Forge show disciple making in action—exponential multiplication through integrated formation and multiplication. What makes these movements possible? Disciple making—the integration of formation and multiplication that creates multiplication capacity.

Contemporary movements integrate formation and multiplication. They form disciples through huddles, triads, and formation practices. They multiply disciples through missional communities, multiplication systems, and sending strategies. They integrate formation and multiplication—disciples learn by making disciples, they grow by multiplying. This integration creates multiplication-focused disciples who multiply—and they do.

This disciple making enables exponential growth because it creates multiplication capacity. Disciples make disciples. Communities form communities. Leaders raise leaders. Movements grow exponentially through disciple making that enables natural, organic multiplication.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Disciple Making

Implementing disciple making faces common challenges that can prevent the integration of formation and multiplication. Understanding these challenges helps us overcome them and implement disciple making. What obstacles prevent disciple making? How do we overcome them? These questions require understanding common challenges.

### Formation vs. Multiplication

The most common challenge to disciple making is the false dichotomy between formation and multiplication—the tendency to separate formation and multiplication into different activities. This separation creates formation programs and multiplication programs—separate activities that don't integrate. Disciple making requires integration—formation and multiplication woven together.

This separation happens when we create discipleship classes separate from multiplication activities, formation programs separate from multiplication strategies. This separation prevents disciple making because it doesn't integrate formation and multiplication. Overcoming this separation requires intentional integration—weaving formation and multiplication together.

The early church avoided this separation by integrating formation and multiplication—formation happened in multiplication, multiplication required formation. Contemporary movements avoid this separation by creating integrated practices—formation and multiplication woven together. When we integrate intentionally, we overcome the false dichotomy and implement disciple making.

### Reproduction Barriers

Another common challenge is reproduction barriers—obstacles that prevent effective multiplication. Reproduction barriers can include lack of multiplication capacity, lack of multiplication systems, lack of multiplication commitment. These barriers prevent disciple making because multiplication is essential. Overcoming reproduction barriers requires addressing the obstacles and creating multiplication capacity.

Reproduction barriers happen when we don't prioritize multiplication, don't create multiplication systems, don't invest in multiplication practices. This prevents disciple making because multiplication is essential. Overcoming reproduction barriers requires prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices.

The early church overcame reproduction barriers by prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices. Contemporary movements overcome reproduction barriers by making multiplication central, building multiplication systems, developing multiplication practices. When we address reproduction barriers, we overcome obstacles and implement disciple making.

### Disciple-Making Resistance

A third common challenge is disciple-making resistance—resistance to multiplication at individual, community, and movement levels. Disciple-making resistance can include fear of multiplication, lack of multiplication capacity, institutional resistance to multiplication. These obstacles prevent disciple making because multiplication is essential. Overcoming disciple-making resistance requires addressing the resistance and creating multiplication capacity.

Disciple-making resistance happens when we don't prioritize multiplication, don't create multiplication systems, don't invest in multiplication practices. This prevents disciple making because multiplication is essential. Overcoming disciple-making resistance requires prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices.

The early church overcame disciple-making resistance by prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices. Contemporary movements overcome disciple-making resistance by making multiplication central, building multiplication systems, developing multiplication practices. When we address disciple-making resistance, we overcome obstacles and implement disciple making.

## Integration: Disciple Making and Movement DNA

Disciple making integrates with other elements of movement DNA, creating a holistic framework for movement multiplication. How does disciple making connect to other mDNA elements? What does integration look like? These questions require understanding how disciple making fits into the larger movement framework.

### Integration with Jesus is Lord

Disciple making integrates with Jesus is Lord—the first element of mDNA. When Jesus is Lord, disciple making becomes natural because following Jesus is what defines us. When disciple making is active, Jesus is Lord is demonstrated because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Jesus is Lord was central—it was the gravitational center. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who followed Jesus naturally multiplied—and they did.

### Integration with Missional-Incarnational Impulse

Disciple making integrates with the missional-incarnational impulse—the third element of mDNA. When disciple making is active, the missional-incarnational impulse becomes natural because disciples who are formed and multiply naturally engage missionally and incarnationally. When the missional-incarnational impulse is active, disciple making is demonstrated because disciples who engage missionally and incarnationally naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. The missional-incarnational impulse was active—it was the engagement pattern. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and multiplied naturally engaged missionally and incarnationally—and they did.

### Integration with APEST Culture

Disciple making integrates with APEST culture—the fourth element of mDNA. When disciple making is active, APEST culture becomes natural because disciples who are formed and multiply naturally activate all five forms of intelligence. When APEST culture is active, disciple making is demonstrated because disciples who activate all five forms of intelligence naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. APEST culture was active—it was the organizational environment. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and multiplied naturally activated all five forms of intelligence—and they did.

### Integration with Organic Systems

Disciple making integrates with organic systems—the fifth element of mDNA. When disciple making is active, organic systems become natural because disciples who are formed and multiply naturally create organic, reproducible systems. When organic systems are active, disciple making is demonstrated because disciples who create organic, reproducible systems naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. Organic systems were active—they were the organizational structures. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and multiplied naturally created organic, reproducible systems—and they did.

### Integration with Liminality & Communitas

Disciple making integrates with liminality and communitas—the sixth element of mDNA. When disciple making is active, liminality and communitas become natural because disciples who are formed and multiply naturally experience liminal spaces and form communitas. When liminality and communitas are active, disciple making is demonstrated because disciples who experience liminal spaces and form communitas naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Disciple making was active—it was the core function. Liminality and communitas were active—they were the community dynamics. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and multiplied naturally experienced liminal spaces and formed communitas—and they did.

## Conclusion

Disciple making is the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission, with multiplication as its natural outcome. It's not about adding multiplication to formation or formation to multiplication—it's about recognizing that authentic disciple making is inherently multiplication-focused, and authentic multiplication requires disciple making.

When we implement disciple making, we discover that it creates movement capacity because it forms disciples who multiply. Disciples make disciples. Communities form communities. Leaders raise leaders. Movements grow exponentially through disciple making that enables natural, organic multiplication.

The challenge is clear: we must implement disciple making in our communities. We must move from formation-focused to multiplication-focused disciple making. We must integrate formation and multiplication. We must create systems where disciples make disciples, communities form communities, leaders raise leaders.

The opportunity is equally clear: when we implement disciple making, we tap into the very source of movement multiplication. We discover that the potential for disciple making already exists within every expression of church, waiting to be activated. We find that movements emerge when disciple making is present—and they cannot form when it is absent.

The call is urgent: implement disciple making in your community. Form disciples who multiply, who make disciples who make disciples. Create systems where disciple making emerges naturally, organically, exponentially. Join the movement of disciples who are multiplying disciples who make disciples.

The journey begins now. The disciple making that created movements throughout history is waiting to be activated. Will you join the movement?
