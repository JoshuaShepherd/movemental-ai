# Disciple Making: Multiplying Disciples Who Make Disciples

> And Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
>
> —Matthew 28:18-20

> It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different objects—education, building, missions, holding services.... The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time.
>
> —C. S. Lewis

> Discipleship means adherence to Christ and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract theology, a forgiveness of sins, render discipleship superfluous, and in fact exclude any idea of following Christ... Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably always Christianity without Christ.

> —Dietrich Bonhoeffer

> Every believer a church planter, every church a church-planting church.

What if disciple making isn't just formation, but multiplication? What if the goal isn't simply to form people into better Christians, but to multiply disciples who make disciples? What if disciple making is the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission, and this task includes the multiplication of disciples who will do the same?

**Disciple making** represents the core practice of the church—the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. He did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs; he made disciples. Disciple making is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move; it is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making. And we are always making disciples who will make disciples.

If you want to understand what makes missional movements so powerful, look no further than disciple making. At the most uncomplicated level, missional movements never appear to get beyond disciple making as a core practice. This is the practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact in and through movements. Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple making.

The multiplication framework emerges from this understanding. Disciple making is not just about formation—it's about reproduction. It's not just about growing individuals—it's about multiplying movements. It's not just about personal transformation—it's about world transformation through the multiplication of disciples who make disciples.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Disciple making is the DNA of movement effectiveness, the seed from which transformative movements grow, the practice that multiplies communities and transforms the world. When disciple making is multiplication-focused rather than merely formation-focused, it creates the exponential growth that characterizes genuine movements.

## The Framework Foundation: Disciple Making as Multiplication

Disciple making begins with a fundamental reorientation around the person and practice of Jesus. Jesus did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs; he made disciples. This was his primary focus, his core practice, his essential mission. When we look at Jesus's ministry, we see someone who invested deeply in a small group of people, teaching them, modeling for them, sending them, and expecting them to multiply.

The Great Commission makes this multiplication focus explicit. Jesus commands us to "make disciples of all nations," and this command includes both the formation dimension (teaching them to obey everything) and the multiplication dimension (going, baptizing, making disciples). The commission is not just about forming disciples—it's about multiplying disciples who will make disciples.

Consider how Jesus made disciples. He called twelve men to follow him. He invested three years in their formation. He modeled the way of the kingdom. He sent them out to practice. He expected them to multiply. The pattern is clear: formation leads to multiplication, and multiplication requires formation. You cannot have one without the other.

The multiplication framework recognizes that every disciple carries within them the potential to make disciples. As a seed contains the full potential of the tree, so the tree contains the full potential of the forest. But it's all there in the seed in the first place. Likewise, as a spark contains the full potential of the flame, so the flame contains the potential of the forest fire. But it's all contained in the spark. Every disciple contains the potential to multiply disciples who will make disciples.

This multiplication focus distinguishes disciple making from mere formation. Formation without multiplication creates mature Christians who don't multiply. Multiplication without formation creates shallow Christians who don't transform. Disciple making requires both—formation that leads to multiplication, and multiplication that deepens formation.

The reproduction focus emerges from this multiplication framework. Disciple making is not just about personal growth—it's about reproducing the life of Christ in others. It's not just about becoming like Jesus—it's about helping others become like Jesus. It's not just about following Jesus—it's about helping others follow Jesus.

This reproduction happens at multiple levels. At the individual level, we reproduce disciples who make disciples. At the community level, we reproduce communities that make communities. At the movement level, we reproduce movements that make movements. This fractal pattern of reproduction creates the exponential multiplication that characterizes genuine movements.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful example of this multiplication framework. When persecution forced them underground, they discovered the essence of disciple making as multiplication. Every believer was expected to plant churches. Every church was expected to multiply. Disciple making was not optional—it was the core practice that multiplied the movement. They grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years, not through programs or institutions, but through disciple making that multiplied disciples who made disciples.

The early church demonstrates this same multiplication pattern. In Acts, we see the church multiplying through disciple making. The apostles made disciples. Those disciples made disciples. Those disciples made disciples. The pattern of multiplication is clear: disciple making creates disciples who make disciples, and this multiplication creates movements that transform the world.

## Practical Application: Practices of Disciple Making

How do we practice disciple making that multiplies? The practices of disciple making are not complicated, but they are costly. They require us to invest deeply in people, to model the way of Jesus, to send people out to practice, and to expect multiplication.

The first practice is Jesus-shaped discipleship. Disciple making must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples. Every single aspect of the way we live out our lives needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. A dynamic, vital, living reality and response to Jesus in every moment of our lives is our most fundamental truth.

N. T. Wright notably states that the longer you look at Jesus, the more you will want to serve him—that is, of course, if it is the real Jesus you are looking at. Because Jesus defines our concepts of God, getting it wrong here means getting it wrong everywhere. And because Jesus defines and models for us a perfected humanity, he shows us the way of true holiness.

Disciple making is basically our lifelong and heartfelt response to Jesus as Lord and Savior. It involves our deepest commitments to allow his life to infuse ours and ours to be drawn up into his. We must become more like our Lord, and he must increasingly take up residence in us. In other words, disciple making is about Christ being formed in you and you being formed in Christ. His humanity provides us with the human image of what we must become because we must become like him. That is what it means to be a mature disciple.

The second practice is reframing evangelism through the lens of discipleship. Reimagining evangelism through the lens of discipleship requires that we let go of certain formulaic approaches to evangelism and the rush to get people to pray a certain formulaic prayer. Rather, we need to reconceive discipleship as a process that begins before conversion and continues long after. A person's salvation really is God's business. Our part in it is to simply devote ourselves to discipling people on the journey with us—as we go.

Imagine that you know your neighbor Jack at least enough to be chummy with him. Taking this discipleship-oriented approach, at one point you might simply say, "You know Jack, we get on just fine, but I have been thinking. I believe that part of the reason for my life is to make yours a whole lot better. I do have some skills in developing people. How about I invest some time into helping you achieve your greatest dreams?" If Jack says, "Sure, let's give it a go," then we will inevitably start sharing the events, people, stories and dreams that have come together to make Jack what he is today. Eventually, the conversation will get beyond stereotypical desires. If we are doing our job properly, meaningful material will be shared at a deeper level as Jack begins to communicate his deepest longings, hurts, fears and hopes. All things going well, God will do "his thing" on Jack, and Jack will give his life to Jesus and be saved. But we don't stop discipling at that point. We continue to help him follow in the way.

This reframing makes space for long-term, authentic, loving relationships with people in our lives. This in turn gives credibility to our message and cultivates meaningful friendships. If every follower of Jesus simply did this with just two or three people, we would have a making-disciples-making-disciples in a "pay-it-forward"-style movement—we would have the kind of exponential, transformative ministry as Jesus intended it.

The third practice is pre-conversion to post-conversion discipleship. The standard practice in the church in its first three centuries was that people had to prove their adherence to Jesus in discipleship before they were allowed to become part of the church! This was the original purpose of the catechisms. In other words, discipleship started long before a person became a convert. In movements that change the world, discipleship is an ethos—a way of life—not just an optional extra for the more dedicated Christians.

The question scholars argue over is when the disciples were actually "born again." Some say John 20:22, where Jesus breathes the Spirit on them, and others say that it was actually at Pentecost. None would say before that! So, even "the Twelve" and "the Seventy" were all what we would call "pre-conversion disciples." What is more, the standard practice in the church in its first three centuries was that people had to prove their adherence to Jesus in discipleship before they were allowed to become part of the church!

This pre-conversion to post-conversion discipleship creates a seamless process of formation and multiplication. Discipleship is not something that starts after conversion—it starts before conversion and continues throughout life. This process creates the multiplication dynamic because people are being discipled to make disciples from the very beginning of their journey.

The fourth practice is multiplication strategies. Disciple making requires intentional strategies for multiplication. This means we don't just form disciples—we form disciples who will make disciples. We don't just grow individuals—we multiply communities. We don't just transform lives—we multiply movements.

The reproduction systems emerge from these multiplication strategies. At the individual level, we create systems that help disciples make disciples. At the community level, we create systems that help communities multiply communities. At the movement level, we create systems that help movements multiply movements. These systems are not complicated—they are simple, reproducible patterns that anyone can follow.

The assessment tools help us measure multiplication. Are we making disciples who make disciples? Are our communities multiplying? Are our movements growing? These questions help us evaluate whether our disciple making is truly multiplication-focused or merely formation-focused.

## Case Studies: Disciple Making in Action

When we look at history, we see disciple making in action. Jesus's own disciple-making provides the foundational example. He called twelve men to follow him. He invested three years in their formation. He modeled the way of the kingdom. He sent them out to practice. He expected them to multiply. The pattern is clear: formation leads to multiplication, and multiplication requires formation.

The early church demonstrates this multiplication pattern. In Acts, we see the church multiplying through disciple making. The apostles made disciples. Those disciples made disciples. Those disciples made disciples. The pattern of multiplication is clear: disciple making creates disciples who make disciples, and this multiplication creates movements that transform the world.

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates disciple making at scale. Wesley didn't create a program—he started a movement. He didn't build an institution—he multiplied disciples. By the end of Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement had spread to America. What was the key? According to missiologist Steve Addison, it was the high level of commitment to the Methodist cause that was expected of participants. This cause declined when the movement lost its ethos of evangelism and disciple-making and degenerated into mere religious institutionalism. Methodism had lost its movemental power.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When persecution forced them underground, they discovered the essence of disciple making as multiplication. Every believer was expected to plant churches. Every church was expected to multiply. Disciple making was not optional—it was the core practice that multiplied the movement. They grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years, not through programs or institutions, but through disciple making that multiplied disciples who made disciples.

Contemporary examples abound. We know of communities that have adopted disciple making as their core practice. Soma Communities in Tacoma, Washington, has adopted this process as a consistent practice. Vision Leader Jeff Vanderstelt rightly emphasizes that the integration of the gospel is a lifelong process. For Soma, in the pre-conversion stage of discipleship, emphasis falls on the evangelism dimension, but is still seen as part of discipleship. Once someone gives her life to Christ, the emphasis shifts from evangelism to discipleship, but in a real sense she is always being evangelized.

The New Thing Network, built by Dave Ferguson and his team at Community Christian Church, has built a network of churches relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God. They believe that everyone is on a journey back to God, and that the movement's mission is to help make this happen. So they take discipleship very seriously. They call it "apprenticeship" because it carries within it the idea of learning by doing. They have apprenticing relationships throughout the communities and many church plants, and this is how they multiply and grow as a church.

## Common Challenges to Disciple Making

The path of disciple making is not without obstacles. The formation vs. multiplication tension represents perhaps the greatest challenge. We have tended to separate formation from multiplication, creating mature Christians who don't multiply or multiplying Christians who don't mature. But disciple making requires both—formation that leads to multiplication, and multiplication that deepens formation.

The reproduction barriers come from our tendency to create dependency rather than multiplication. We have created systems that make people dependent on programs, institutions, and professionals rather than systems that multiply disciples who make disciples. We need to shift from dependency-creating systems to multiplication-creating systems.

The disciple-making resistance comes from within ourselves. We are naturally drawn to programs, events, and activities that feel productive but don't actually multiply. The call to disciple making challenges these instincts. It requires us to invest deeply in people, to model the way of Jesus, to send people out to practice, and to expect multiplication. This resistance is not just external—it's internal. We resist disciple making because it costs us something. It requires sacrifice, investment, and multiplication.

The multiplication transformation challenges our assumptions about what success looks like. We have domesticated disciple making into programs, classes, and curricula. But disciple making is not a program—it's a way of life. It's not something we complete—it's something we embody. It's not about accumulating knowledge—it's about becoming like Jesus and helping others become like Jesus. This transformation requires us to rethink everything we thought we knew about disciple making.

## Integration: Disciple Making and the Movement Ecosystem

Disciple making does not exist in isolation. It connects to the broader ecosystem of missional movement. It is the foundation upon which movements are built, the DNA that multiplies communities, the seed from which transformation grows.

The connection to missional discipleship is direct and essential. Disciple making is missional discipleship in its multiplication-focused form. It refuses to be separated from mission, to be domesticated into programs, to be tamed by institutional safety. Missional discipleship that is not multiplication-focused is not truly missional—it's just another form of religious activity.

The connection to the mDNA Disciple-Making element is crucial. Disciple making is not just one element among many—it is the multiplication-focused dynamic that activates all the other elements. When disciple making is multiplication-focused, it multiplies. When it multiplies, it creates movement. When it creates movement, it transforms the world.

The connection to the broader discipleship portal reveals how disciple making integrates with missional discipleship, untamed discipleship, and everyday mission. These are not separate practices—they are dimensions of the same multiplication-focused disciple making that multiplies disciples who make disciples.

The connection to the APEST framework reveals how disciple making activates all five forms of intelligence. Apostolic intelligence extends the movement into new contexts. Prophetic intelligence challenges the status quo. Evangelistic intelligence gathers people to the cause. Shepherding intelligence cares for the community. Teaching intelligence equips people for mission. Disciple making requires all five, working together, to create the multiplication-focused dynamic that transforms the world.

## Conclusion: Multiplying Disciples Who Make Disciples

Disciple making is not a program to complete but a practice to embody. It is the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission, and this task includes the multiplication of disciples who will do the same. Disciple making is not just about formation—it's about multiplication. It's not just about growing individuals—it's about multiplying movements.

The multiplication framework recognizes that every disciple carries within them the potential to make disciples. As a seed contains the full potential of the tree, so the tree contains the full potential of the forest. But it's all there in the seed in the first place. Every disciple contains the potential to multiply disciples who will make disciples.

The practices of disciple making—Jesus-shaped discipleship, reframing evangelism through the lens of discipleship, pre-conversion to post-conversion discipleship, and multiplication strategies—provide the framework for this multiplication. They are not steps to complete but postures to embody. They create the multiplication-focused dynamic that transforms individuals, communities, and movements.

The challenge before us is clear: will we embrace disciple making as multiplication, or will we continue to settle for formation without multiplication? Will we multiply disciples who make disciples, or will we create mature Christians who don't multiply? Will we follow the multiplication-focused way of Jesus, or will we settle for a domesticated, programmatic approach?

The question is whether we'll have the courage to step into the multiplication-focused future that is coming. The question is whether we'll multiply disciples who make disciples, creating the exponential growth that characterizes genuine movements. The question is whether we'll remember what it really means to make disciples as Jesus intended.

Together, we can multiply disciples who make disciples. Together, we can create the exponential growth that transforms the world. Together, we can follow the multiplication-focused way of Jesus. The disciple-making way of multiplication awaits us. Will we have the courage to follow?
