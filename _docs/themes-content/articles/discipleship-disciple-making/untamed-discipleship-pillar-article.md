What if discipleship has been tamed—domesticated into programs instead of movements? What if the early church's growth from 25,000 to 20 million in just three centuries wasn't about superior programs or strategies, but about discipleship that was inherently wild, missional, and untamed? What if the Methodist movement's impact wasn't about organizational excellence, but about untamed discipleship that created multiplication capacity? What if every local church already has the potential for untamed discipleship—if only we would recognize and reactivate it?

These questions have shaped my journey into understanding what makes movements move. After years of studying history's most remarkable Jesus movements and working with contemporary communities seeking to multiply, I began to see patterns that couldn't be explained by programs, strategies, or leadership models alone. Something deeper was at work—a form of discipleship that was inherently wild, missional, and untamed, forming disciples who multiplied and transformed communities.

That something is **untamed discipleship**—the reactivation of a missional form of discipleship that refuses to be domesticated, that maintains its wild edge, that forms disciples who multiply and transform communities. Untamed discipleship isn't about adding wildness to discipleship or discipleship to wildness—it's about recognizing that authentic discipleship is inherently untamed, and authentic mission requires untamed formation. When discipleship and mission are integrated in their untamed form, untamed discipleship emerges—and multiplication capacity is created.

## Understanding Untamed Discipleship

**Untamed discipleship** refers to the reactivation of a missional form of discipleship that refuses to be domesticated, that maintains its wild edge, that forms disciples who multiply and transform communities. It's not about adding wildness to discipleship or discipleship to wildness—it's about recognizing that authentic discipleship is inherently untamed, and authentic mission requires untamed formation. Untamed discipleship forms disciples who are wild, who multiply, who transform—disciples who are untamed by nature.

The reactivation of untamed discipleship is crucial. Discipleship without wildness becomes formation without edge—disciples who are formed but not sent. Mission without untamed formation becomes activity without transformation—missionaries who are sent but not formed. Untamed discipleship integrates both—disciples who are formed and sent, who are shaped by Jesus and sent by Jesus, who follow Jesus and join Jesus's mission in their untamed form.

Untamed discipleship creates multiplication capacity because it forms disciples who multiply. When disciples are untamed, they naturally multiply—making disciples who make disciples, forming communities that form communities, transforming neighborhoods that transform neighborhoods. This multiplication capacity is what makes movements move—untamed discipleship that creates exponential growth.

### The Skylark Parable

The parable of the skylark illustrates the danger of domestication. A white skylark, flying joyously about the sky, is enticed by a merchant offering delicious worms in exchange for feathers. Day after day, the skylark returns, trading feathers for worms, growing fatter and balder. Eventually, the skylark realizes she can no longer fly—she has lost her capacity for flight through a thousand little compromises. The merchant, revealed as the devil, puts her in a cage and walks away laughing.

This parable mirrors the process of discipleship gone wrong. Little by little, we give up our freedoms in Christ, only to end up in a cage made of a thousand little compromises. When we try to take shortcuts to costly discipleship, we end up with a domesticated existence that is far from the liberated, untamed life Jesus calls us to. Much of what undermines our capacity to experience full, Christlike lives comes from personal and cultural issues, and the idolatry so often associated with them, that in the end undermine our capacity to experience untamed discipleship.

If some of what seems strange to us, then it might well be because we have become too domesticated, accustomed to being featherless, and have now lost the art of flight. Perhaps it is because we have forgotten what it really means to follow the untamed, revolutionary Jesus. We must now remember in order to reactivate the journey.

### Jesus-Shaped Discipleship

Untamed discipleship must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples. Every single aspect of the way we live out our lives needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. A dynamic, vital, living reality and response to Jesus in every moment of our lives is our most fundamental truth, and we have forgotten it to our great peril.

Jesus-shaped discipleship means following Jesus—not just learning about Jesus, not just believing in Jesus, but following Jesus. It means letting Jesus define our concepts of God, our understanding of humanity, our approach to mission. It means modeling our lives on Jesus, letting him live through us, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice.

N. T. Wright notably states that the longer you look at Jesus, the more you will want to serve him—that is, of course, if it is the real Jesus you are looking at. Because Jesus defines our concepts of God, getting it wrong here means getting it wrong everywhere. And because Jesus defines and models for us a perfected humanity, he shows us the way of true holiness—the untamed way.

The early church demonstrated Jesus-shaped discipleship. They followed Jesus—not just learned about him or believed in him, but followed him. They let Jesus define everything—their understanding of God, their approach to mission, their way of life. This Jesus-shaped discipleship created multiplication capacity because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply—and they did.

### Shema Spirituality

The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4–9) is considered the most important confession in the Old Testament and in Judaism, and is confessed three times a day by every orthodox Jew. The word shema itself stems from the first word of this text and simply means "listen!" or "take heed." "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength."

Jesus explicitly places the Shema at the epicenter of what it means to be a true disciple—to love God, to love others, and to live this out authentically in God's world. We must simply take Jesus at face value here; he is saying that "Shema spirituality" is core to the outworking of our discipleship—our life under God.

Shema spirituality helps us integrate love for God and love for neighbor—creating disciples who are formed in relationship with God and sent in relationship with others. When formation includes Shema spirituality, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally engage in mission.

The early church practiced Shema spirituality. They formed disciples through love for God and love for neighbor. This formation created untamed disciples because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally engage in mission. Contemporary movements practice Shema spirituality through spiritual practices, community formation, and missional engagement. When we form disciples through Shema spirituality, untamed discipleship emerges.

## Framework Foundation: Untamed Discipleship as Movement DNA

Understanding untamed discipleship requires grasping how it functions as core DNA of movements. Untamed discipleship isn't optional for movements—it's essential. When untamed discipleship is present, movements emerge. When untamed discipleship is absent, movements cannot form. This is why untamed discipleship is essential to the second element of mDNA—it's the core function that creates multiplication capacity.

### The Second Element of mDNA

Untamed discipleship is essential to the second element of the mDNA framework—Disciple-Making. This element is essential because it creates the multiplication capacity that movements require. Without untamed discipleship, movements cannot multiply. With untamed discipleship, movements multiply naturally, organically, exponentially.

The order matters. Jesus is Lord comes first—it's the gravitational center. Untamed discipleship comes second—it's the core function. When Jesus is Lord, untamed discipleship becomes natural because following Jesus is what defines us. When untamed discipleship is active, multiplication becomes natural because disciples multiply.

The early church demonstrated this. Jesus is Lord was central—it was the gravitational center. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who followed Jesus naturally multiplied—and they did.

### Formation and Multiplication

Untamed discipleship involves both formation and multiplication. Formation shapes disciples—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. Multiplication spreads disciples—making disciples who make disciples. Both are essential. Formation without multiplication creates disciples who are formed but don't multiply. Multiplication without formation creates disciples who multiply but aren't formed. Untamed discipleship integrates both—formation that enables multiplication, multiplication that requires formation.

The early church demonstrated this integration. They formed disciples—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. They multiplied disciples—making disciples who made disciples. This integration created multiplication capacity because formation enabled multiplication, and multiplication required formation.

Contemporary movements demonstrate this integration. They form disciples through intentional practices—teaching, modeling, coaching. They multiply disciples through natural relationships—disciples making disciples. This integration creates multiplication capacity because formation enables multiplication, and multiplication requires formation.

### Mission as DNA

In untamed discipleship, mission is DNA—it's encoded in the very nature of discipleship. Discipleship isn't formation that then leads to mission. Discipleship is formation that is inherently missional. Mission isn't activity that then requires discipleship. Mission is activity that requires discipleship. Mission and discipleship are integrated—mission is discipleship's DNA.

The early church demonstrated this. Mission was DNA—it was encoded in discipleship. Discipleship was inherently missional—disciples were formed to be sent. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples who are missional by nature naturally multiply—and they did.

Contemporary movements demonstrate this. Mission is DNA—it's encoded in discipleship. Discipleship is inherently missional—disciples are formed to be sent. This integration creates multiplication capacity because disciples who are missional by nature naturally multiply.

## Practical Application: Implementing Untamed Discipleship

Implementing untamed discipleship requires practical application of the framework. How do we actually reactivate untamed discipleship? What specific practices implement untamed discipleship? What steps can we take to move from domesticated discipleship to untamed discipleship? These questions require practical guidance for implementation.

### Formation Practices

The first step in implementing untamed discipleship is intentional formation. How do we form disciples who are untamed? What practices shape untamed disciples? Formation practices must integrate discipleship and mission—forming disciples who are sent.

**Jesus-centered formation.** Form disciples around Jesus—his person, his story, his mission. Jesus-centered formation means letting Jesus define everything—our understanding of God, our approach to mission, our way of life. When formation is Jesus-centered, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who follow Jesus naturally join his mission.

The early church practiced Jesus-centered formation. They formed disciples around Jesus—his person, his story, his mission. This formation created untamed disciples because disciples who follow Jesus naturally join his mission. Contemporary movements practice Jesus-centered formation through Jesus studies, gospel fluency, and missional practices. When we form disciples around Jesus, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Shema spirituality.** Form disciples through Shema spirituality—loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. Shema spirituality integrates love for God and love for neighbor—creating disciples who are formed in relationship with God and sent in relationship with others. When formation includes Shema spirituality, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally engage in mission.

The early church practiced Shema spirituality. They formed disciples through love for God and love for neighbor. This formation created untamed disciples because disciples who love God and neighbor naturally engage in mission. Contemporary movements practice Shema spirituality through spiritual practices, community formation, and missional engagement. When we form disciples through Shema spirituality, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Obedience-based learning.** Form disciples through obedience—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. Obedience-based learning means learning by doing—following Jesus in practice, not just in theory. When formation is obedience-based, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who obey Jesus naturally join his mission.

The early church practiced obedience-based learning. They formed disciples through obedience—teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded. This formation created untamed disciples because disciples who obey Jesus naturally join his mission. Contemporary movements practice obedience-based learning through missional practices, accountability, and coaching. When we form disciples through obedience, untamed discipleship emerges.

### Multiplication Practices

The second step in implementing untamed discipleship is intentional multiplication. How do we multiply disciples who are untamed? What practices enable multiplication? Multiplication practices must integrate discipleship and mission—multiplying disciples who are sent.

**Disciples making disciples.** Create systems where disciples make disciples—not just leaders making disciples, but disciples making disciples. Disciples making disciples means every disciple is a disciple-maker—every follower is a multiplier. When multiplication includes disciples making disciples, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who make disciples naturally multiply.

The early church practiced disciples making disciples. They created systems where disciples made disciples—every follower was a multiplier. This multiplication created untamed disciples because disciples who make disciples naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice disciples making disciples through huddles, triads, and multiplication systems. When we create systems where disciples make disciples, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Communities forming communities.** Create systems where communities form communities—not just leaders planting churches, but communities forming communities. Communities forming communities means every community is a multiplier—every gathering is a sender. When multiplication includes communities forming communities, untamed discipleship emerges because communities that form communities naturally multiply.

The early church practiced communities forming communities. They created systems where communities formed communities—every gathering was a sender. This multiplication created untamed disciples because communities that form communities naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice communities forming communities through multiplication strategies, sending systems, and network formation. When we create systems where communities form communities, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Leaders raising leaders.** Create systems where leaders raise leaders—not just leaders leading, but leaders raising. Leaders raising leaders means every leader is a multiplier—every shepherd is a developer. When multiplication includes leaders raising leaders, untamed discipleship emerges because leaders who raise leaders naturally multiply.

The early church practiced leaders raising leaders. They created systems where leaders raised leaders—every shepherd was a developer. This multiplication created untamed disciples because leaders who raise leaders naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice leaders raising leaders through leadership development, coaching, and multiplication pathways. When we create systems where leaders raise leaders, untamed discipleship emerges.

### Integration Practices

The third step in implementing untamed discipleship is intentional integration. How do we integrate discipleship and mission? What practices create integration? Integration practices must weave discipleship and mission together—creating untamed discipleship.

**Mission in formation.** Include mission in formation—not formation then mission, but mission in formation. Mission in formation means disciples are formed through mission—they learn by doing, they grow by going. When formation includes mission, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who are formed through mission naturally multiply.

The early church practiced mission in formation. They included mission in formation—disciples learned by doing, they grew by going. This integration created untamed disciples because disciples who are formed through mission naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice mission in formation through missional practices, on-the-job training, and mission-based learning. When we include mission in formation, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Formation in mission.** Include formation in mission—not mission then formation, but formation in mission. Formation in mission means disciples are formed while on mission—they grow while going, they learn while serving. When mission includes formation, untamed discipleship emerges because disciples who are formed in mission naturally multiply.

The early church practiced formation in mission. They included formation in mission—disciples grew while going, they learned while serving. This integration created untamed disciples because disciples who are formed in mission naturally multiply. Contemporary movements practice formation in mission through coaching, reflection, and mission-based formation. When we include formation in mission, untamed discipleship emerges.

**Integrated rhythms.** Create integrated rhythms—not separate times for discipleship and mission, but integrated rhythms that weave them together. Integrated rhythms mean discipleship and mission happen together—formation and multiplication are integrated. When rhythms are integrated, untamed discipleship emerges because discipleship and mission are woven together.

The early church practiced integrated rhythms. They created rhythms where discipleship and mission happened together—formation and multiplication were integrated. This integration created untamed disciples because discipleship and mission were woven together. Contemporary movements practice integrated rhythms through missional communities, formation practices, and multiplication systems. When we create integrated rhythms, untamed discipleship emerges.

## Case Studies: Untamed Discipleship in Action

Understanding untamed discipleship requires seeing it in action. Historical movements demonstrate untamed discipleship through their practices, systems, and multiplication. Contemporary movements demonstrate untamed discipleship through their formation, mission, and growth. These case studies reveal untamed discipleship in real contexts.

### Jesus and His Disciples: The Original Model

Jesus demonstrated untamed discipleship through his relationship with his disciples. He formed them through relationship, teaching, and modeling. He sent them on mission—first the twelve, then the seventy-two. He integrated formation and mission—disciples learned by following, they grew by going. This integration created untamed disciples who multiplied—and they did.

Jesus's model reveals untamed discipleship in action. Formation happened in mission—disciples learned by following Jesus on mission. Mission required formation—disciples were sent after being formed. This integration created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally multiplied.

The early church followed Jesus's model. They formed disciples through relationship, teaching, and modeling. They sent disciples on mission—first locally, then regionally, then globally. They integrated formation and mission—disciples learned by doing, they grew by going. This integration created untamed disciples who multiplied—and they did.

### The Early Church: Untamed Discipleship Under Persecution

The early church demonstrated remarkable untamed discipleship under severe persecution. From AD 100 to 310, the church grew from approximately 25,000 to 20 million—an exponential multiplication that reveals untamed discipleship in action. What made this possible? Untamed discipleship—the integration of discipleship and mission that created multiplication capacity.

The early church integrated discipleship and mission. They formed disciples through teaching, community, and practices. They sent disciples on mission—locally, regionally, globally. They integrated formation and mission—disciples learned by doing, they grew by going. This integration created untamed disciples who multiplied—and they did.

This untamed discipleship enabled exponential growth because it created multiplication capacity. Disciples made disciples. Communities formed communities. Leaders raised leaders. The movement grew exponentially not through programs or strategies, but through untamed discipleship that enabled natural, organic multiplication.

### The Methodist Movement: Untamed Discipleship Through Systems

The Methodist movement demonstrated remarkable untamed discipleship through intentional systems. Under John Wesley's leadership, the movement grew from a small group to one in thirty people in Britain—an exponential multiplication that reveals untamed discipleship in action. What made this possible? Untamed discipleship—the integration of discipleship and mission enabled through intentional systems.

The Methodist movement integrated discipleship and mission through class meetings, circuit riders, and connectional systems. They formed disciples through class meetings—small groups for formation and accountability. They sent disciples through circuit riders—leaders who traveled and multiplied. They integrated formation and mission—disciples learned in class meetings, they multiplied through circuits. This integration created untamed disciples who multiplied—and they did.

This untamed discipleship enabled exponential growth because it created multiplication capacity. Class meetings multiplied. Disciples made disciples. Leaders raised leaders. The movement grew exponentially through untamed discipleship enabled by intentional systems.

### Contemporary Movements: Untamed Discipleship Today

Contemporary movements demonstrate untamed discipleship through their practices, systems, and growth. Movements like 3DM, Soma, and Forge show untamed discipleship in action—exponential multiplication through integrated discipleship and mission. What makes these movements possible? Untamed discipleship—the integration of discipleship and mission that creates multiplication capacity.

Contemporary movements integrate discipleship and mission. They form disciples through huddles, triads, and formation practices. They send disciples through missional communities, multiplication systems, and sending strategies. They integrate formation and mission—disciples learn by doing, they grow by going. This integration creates untamed disciples who multiply—and they do.

This untamed discipleship enables exponential growth because it creates multiplication capacity. Disciples make disciples. Communities form communities. Leaders raise leaders. Movements grow exponentially through untamed discipleship that enables natural, organic multiplication.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Untamed Discipleship

Implementing untamed discipleship faces common challenges that can prevent the reactivation of wild, missional formation. Understanding these challenges helps us overcome them and implement untamed discipleship. What obstacles prevent untamed discipleship? How do we overcome them? These questions require understanding common challenges.

### Domestication

The most common challenge to untamed discipleship is domestication—the tendency to tame discipleship into programs and systems that lose their wild edge. Domestication creates discipleship programs and mission programs—separate activities that don't integrate. Untamed discipleship requires wildness—discipleship and mission woven together in their untamed form.

Domestication happens when we create discipleship classes separate from mission activities, formation programs separate from multiplication strategies. This separation prevents untamed discipleship because it doesn't integrate discipleship and mission in their wild form. Overcoming domestication requires intentional reactivation—weaving discipleship and mission together in their untamed form.

The early church avoided domestication by integrating discipleship and mission—formation happened in mission, mission required formation. Contemporary movements avoid domestication by creating integrated practices—formation and mission woven together in their wild form. When we integrate intentionally, we overcome domestication and implement untamed discipleship.

### Formation Barriers

Another common challenge is formation barriers—obstacles that prevent effective formation. Formation barriers can include lack of time, lack of resources, lack of commitment. These barriers prevent untamed discipleship because formation is essential. Overcoming formation barriers requires addressing the obstacles and creating effective formation.

Formation barriers happen when we don't prioritize formation, don't create formation systems, don't invest in formation practices. This prevents untamed discipleship because formation is essential. Overcoming formation barriers requires prioritizing formation, creating systems, investing in practices.

The early church overcame formation barriers by prioritizing formation, creating systems, investing in practices. Contemporary movements overcome formation barriers by making formation central, building formation systems, developing formation practices. When we address formation barriers, we overcome obstacles and implement untamed discipleship.

### Multiplication Resistance

A third common challenge is multiplication resistance—resistance to multiplication at individual, community, and movement levels. Multiplication resistance can include fear of multiplication, lack of multiplication capacity, institutional resistance to multiplication. These obstacles prevent untamed discipleship because multiplication is essential. Overcoming multiplication resistance requires addressing the resistance and creating multiplication capacity.

Multiplication resistance happens when we don't prioritize multiplication, don't create multiplication systems, don't invest in multiplication practices. This prevents untamed discipleship because multiplication is essential. Overcoming multiplication resistance requires prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices.

The early church overcame multiplication resistance by prioritizing multiplication, creating systems, investing in practices. Contemporary movements overcome multiplication resistance by making multiplication central, building multiplication systems, developing multiplication practices. When we address multiplication resistance, we overcome obstacles and implement untamed discipleship.

## Integration: Untamed Discipleship and Movement DNA

Untamed discipleship integrates with other elements of movement DNA, creating a holistic framework for movement multiplication. How does untamed discipleship connect to other mDNA elements? What does integration look like? These questions require understanding how untamed discipleship fits into the larger movement framework.

### Integration with Jesus is Lord

Untamed discipleship integrates with Jesus is Lord—the first element of mDNA. When Jesus is Lord, untamed discipleship becomes natural because following Jesus is what defines us. When untamed discipleship is active, Jesus is Lord is demonstrated because disciples who follow Jesus naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Jesus is Lord was central—it was the gravitational center. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who followed Jesus naturally multiplied—and they did.

### Integration with Missional-Incarnational Impulse

Untamed discipleship integrates with the missional-incarnational impulse—the third element of mDNA. When discipleship is untamed, the missional-incarnational impulse becomes natural because disciples who are formed and sent naturally engage missionally and incarnationally. When the missional-incarnational impulse is active, untamed discipleship is demonstrated because disciples who engage missionally and incarnationally naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. The missional-incarnational impulse was active—it was the engagement pattern. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally engaged missionally and incarnationally—and they did.

### Integration with APEST Culture

Untamed discipleship integrates with APEST culture—the fourth element of mDNA. When discipleship is untamed, APEST culture becomes natural because disciples who are formed and sent naturally activate all five forms of intelligence. When APEST culture is active, untamed discipleship is demonstrated because disciples who activate all five forms of intelligence naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. APEST culture was active—it was the organizational environment. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally activated all five forms of intelligence—and they did.

### Integration with Organic Systems

Untamed discipleship integrates with organic systems—the fifth element of mDNA. When discipleship is untamed, organic systems become natural because disciples who are formed and sent naturally create organic, reproducible systems. When organic systems are active, untamed discipleship is demonstrated because disciples who create organic, reproducible systems naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. Organic systems were active—they were the organizational structures. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally created organic, reproducible systems—and they did.

### Integration with Liminality & Communitas

Untamed discipleship integrates with liminality and communitas—the sixth element of mDNA. When discipleship is untamed, liminality and communitas become natural because disciples who are formed and sent naturally experience liminal spaces and form communitas. When liminality and communitas are active, untamed discipleship is demonstrated because disciples who experience liminal spaces and form communitas naturally multiply.

The early church demonstrated this integration. Untamed discipleship was active—it was the core function. Liminality and communitas were active—they were the community dynamics. This combination created multiplication capacity because disciples who were formed and sent naturally experienced liminal spaces and formed communitas—and they did.

## Conclusion

Untamed discipleship is the reactivation of a missional form of discipleship that refuses to be domesticated, that maintains its wild edge, that forms disciples who multiply and transform communities. It's not about adding wildness to discipleship or discipleship to wildness—it's about recognizing that authentic discipleship is inherently untamed, and authentic mission requires untamed formation.

When we reactivate untamed discipleship, we discover that it creates multiplication capacity because it forms disciples who multiply. Disciples make disciples. Communities form communities. Leaders raise leaders. Movements grow exponentially through untamed discipleship that enables natural, organic multiplication.

The challenge is clear: we must reactivate untamed discipleship in our communities. We must move from domesticated discipleship to untamed discipleship. We must integrate formation and mission in their wild form. We must create systems where disciples make disciples, communities form communities, leaders raise leaders.

The opportunity is equally clear: when we reactivate untamed discipleship, we tap into the very source of movement multiplication. We discover that the potential for untamed discipleship already exists within every expression of church, waiting to be awakened. We find that movements emerge when untamed discipleship is present—and they cannot form when it is absent.

The call is urgent: reactivate untamed discipleship in your community. Form disciples who are wild, who multiply, who transform. Create systems where untamed discipleship emerges naturally, organically, exponentially. Join the movement of untamed disciples who are reactivating a missional form of discipleship that refuses to be domesticated.

The journey begins now. The skylark can fly again. The untamed discipleship that created movements throughout history is waiting to be reactivated. Will you join the movement?
