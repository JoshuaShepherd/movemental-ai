What if the early church's ways weren't lost, just forgotten? What if those remarkable patterns that enabled exponential growth from 25,000 to 20 million in just three centuries are still encoded in every local church—waiting to be rediscovered and reactivated? What if the recovery of these forgotten ways could unlock movement capacity in contemporary contexts?

These questions launched my journey into understanding what made the early church so remarkably effective—and what we've forgotten that keeps us from experiencing the same movement capacity today. After years of studying history's most remarkable Jesus movements, I began to see patterns that couldn't be explained by programs, strategies, or leadership models alone. Something deeper was at work—something encoded in the very nature of what it means to be God's people.

That something is **the forgotten ways**—the ancient patterns that reactivate missional church movements. These aren't new innovations or modern strategies—they're the recovery of what's always been there, latent in every Christian and every church, waiting to be reactivated under the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Understanding the Forgotten Ways

**The forgotten ways** refers to the ancient patterns of being and doing that characterized authentic Jesus movements throughout history—patterns that have been buried beneath centuries of institutional formation but remain latent in every local church. These aren't lost techniques or obsolete methods—they're the recovery of apostolic genius that lies dormant within us.

When we speak of the forgotten ways, we're talking about the ways of the early church—the patterns that enabled exponential growth and transformation. We're talking about the ways of historical movements—the Methodist movement, the Moravian movement, the Celtic movement, the Chinese underground church. We're talking about the ways that reactivate missional church movements in contemporary contexts.

The forgotten ways aren't about nostalgia or romanticizing the past. They're about rediscovering what's always been there—the apostolic genius encoded in the DNA of God's people. They're about recovering what we've forgotten through centuries of institutional accommodation. They're about reactivating what's latent within us, waiting to be awakened.

### Rediscovering Early Church Patterns

The recovery of the forgotten ways begins with rediscovering early church patterns. Those first three centuries (AD 100-310) represent apostolic genius in its purest form—before institutional structures developed, before professional clergy emerged, before buildings became associated with church. In those early years, we see movement DNA expressing itself without the inhibitions that came later.

When we rediscover early church patterns, we're not trying to recreate the first century. We're trying to recover the principles that made the first century so effective. We're extracting patterns from history that can inform contemporary practice. We're learning from history's most effective Jesus movement so we can activate movement capacity in our own contexts.

Early church patterns show us how apostolic genius expresses itself when fully active. Jesus is Lord orients everything. Disciple-making happens through relationships. Mission sends the church into diverse cultures. APEST culture releases every member. Organic systems enable multiplication. Liminality-communitas forms missional community.

These patterns aren't historical curiosities—they're the forgotten ways that reactivate missional church movements.

### Reactivation Principles: Unlocking Movement Capacity

What are the principles behind the forgotten ways? How do we unlock movement capacity that lies dormant within us? The reactivation principles provide the framework for understanding how to recover what we've forgotten.

**Principle 1: Apostolic Genius is Latent, Not Lost**

The first principle is that apostolic genius isn't lost—it's latent. The forgotten ways aren't missing—they're dormant. The movement DNA isn't absent—it's inactive. Every Christian, every local church, every Jesus community carries within it the complete genetic code for apostolic movement. We don't need to import movement capacity from somewhere else—we need to activate what's already there.

This principle changes everything. We're not trying to build something new—we're trying to activate what's ancient. We're not importing movement from outside—we're releasing movement from within. We're not creating apostolic genius—we're awakening it.

**Principle 2: Institutional Formation Buries Movement DNA**

The second principle is that institutional formation has buried movement DNA beneath layers of structure, control, and maintenance. The forgotten ways haven't disappeared—they've been suppressed by systems designed for stability rather than multiplication.

This doesn't mean institutions are bad—but they often work against the dynamics that enable movement. Professional clergy can suppress APEST culture that releases all people. Buildings can suppress organic systems that enable multiplication. Programs can suppress disciple-making that happens relationally. Maintenance can suppress mission that sends us out.

Recovering the forgotten ways requires recognizing how institutional formation has suppressed movement DNA—and then intentionally working to reactivate what's been buried.

**Principle 3: Reactivation Requires Paradigm Shifts**

The third principle is that reactivating the forgotten ways requires paradigm shifts—fundamental changes in how we think about church, leadership, structure, and mission. We can't simply add new programs to old structures. We must fundamentally reimagine how church operates when apostolic genius is active.

This requires addressing what I call the "operating system" level, not just the "program" level. Just as you can't run advanced software on an outdated operating system, so you can't activate apostolic genius within institutional structures designed to prevent it. Reactivation requires paradigm shifts that change the foundational assumptions on which our current expressions of church are built.

**Principle 4: Patterns Must Be Adapted, Not Copied**

The fourth principle is that the forgotten ways must be adapted for contemporary contexts, not simply copied from history. We're not trying to recreate the first century—we're trying to recover the principles that made the first century effective.

This requires wisdom and discernment. We need to understand the principles behind the practices, then creatively adapt those principles for our contexts. We're extracting patterns from history, then expressing those patterns in contemporary ways. We're recovering the forgotten ways, then adapting them for our times.

### Movement Rediscovery: What We've Forgotten

What specifically have we forgotten? What are the forgotten ways that need to be rediscovered and reactivated?

**We've Forgotten Jesus is Lord**

We've forgotten that Jesus is Lord isn't just theological—it's practical and costly. In the early church, declaring "Jesus is Lord" meant simultaneously declaring "Caesar is not Lord"—which put you at odds with the entire power structure. Today, we've accommodated Jesus' lordship to cultural authorities—consumerism, individualism, nationalism. We've forgotten that Jesus is Lord means orienting everything around the kingdom of God, not the kingdoms of this world.

**We've Forgotten Disciple-Making is the Core Function**

We've forgotten that disciple-making isn't a program—it's the core function of every Christian and every church. In the early church, discipleship happened through relationships, obedience, and community. Today, we've programmatized disciple-making into classes and courses that transmit information without transformation. We've forgotten that disciple-making is relational, organic, and multipliable.

**We've Forgotten We're Sent, Not Gathered**

We've forgotten that the church is sent, not gathered. In the early church, the missional-incarnational impulse sent the church into diverse cultures. Today, we've become attractional—expecting people to come to us rather than going to them. We've forgotten that mission means incarnating the gospel in contexts rather than expecting contexts to come to us.

**We've Forgotten APEST Releases All People**

We've forgotten that APEST culture releases all of God's people to function according to their design. In the early church, every member functioned—apostles extending, prophets speaking, evangelists proclaiming, shepherds caring, teachers grounding. Today, we've professionalized ministry into clergy roles that leave most people as passive recipients. We've forgotten that fivefold ministry releases the entire body, not just a few.

**We've Forgotten Organic Systems Enable Multiplication**

We've forgotten that organic systems enable multiplication through decentralized, distributed structures. In the early church, house churches and networks allowed movement to spread without centralized control. Today, we've centralized control through buildings, programs, and professional leadership. We've forgotten that multiplication happens through organic systems, not institutional control.

**We've Forgotten Liminality-Communitas Forms Missional Community**

We've forgotten that liminality-communitas forms missional community around shared mission. In the early church, persecution and marginalization created the conditions where genuine community formed. Today, we've settled into comfort zones that prevent the formation of missional community. We've forgotten that liminality-communitas creates the conditions where apostolic genius activates.

These are the forgotten ways—the patterns we've lost through centuries of institutional formation, the principles we need to recover to reactivate missional church movements.

## Practical Application: Reactivating the Forgotten Ways

Understanding the forgotten ways is one thing. Reactivating them in contemporary contexts is another. How do we move from historical recovery to practical reactivation? How do we unlock movement capacity that lies dormant within us?

### Pattern Rediscovery: Learning from History

Reactivating the forgotten ways begins with pattern rediscovery—learning from history's most effective Jesus movements. This isn't about copying—it's about understanding the principles behind the practices, then adapting those principles for our contexts.

We study the early church to understand how apostolic genius expressed itself in those first three centuries. We study historical movements—Methodist, Moravian, Celtic, Chinese underground—to see how apostolic genius activated in different contexts. We extract patterns from history, then adapt those patterns for contemporary expression.

Pattern rediscovery requires careful study. We look at what actually happened, not just what we wish had happened. We see the challenges as well as the successes. We learn from both what worked and what didn't. We extract principles from practices, then adapt those principles for our contexts.

### Reactivation Strategies: Unlocking Movement Capacity

Once we've rediscovered the patterns, how do we reactivate them? What strategies unlock movement capacity that lies dormant within us?

**Strategy 1: Assess Current Expression**

The first strategy is honest assessment—evaluating how well the forgotten ways are currently expressed in our communities. This requires looking at each pattern and asking: Is this present? Is it active? Is it dormant? Is it missing?

We assess Jesus is Lord: Is Jesus truly the orienting authority, or do other authorities compete? We assess disciple-making: Is it our core function, or is it peripheral? We assess mission: Are we sent, or are we attractional? We assess APEST: Are all functions active, or are we functioning with less? We assess organic systems: Do they enable multiplication, or do they require control? We assess liminality-communitas: Are we in liminal spaces, or settled in comfort?

Honest assessment reveals gaps between current practice and the forgotten ways. These gaps become the focus for intentional reactivation.

**Strategy 2: Activate Dormant Patterns**

The second strategy is intentional activation—working to awaken patterns that are dormant within us. This isn't about adding new programs—it's about activating what's already there.

If Jesus is Lord is dormant, we activate it by choosing allegiance to Jesus over cultural authorities. If disciple-making is dormant, we activate it by making it our core function. If mission is dormant, we activate it by going to people rather than asking them to come to us. If APEST is dormant, we activate it by releasing all people to function. If organic systems are dormant, we activate them by decentralizing structures. If liminality-communitas is dormant, we activate it by engaging risky mission.

Intentional activation requires persistence. Dormant patterns don't activate overnight. They require consistent, persistent work until they begin to express themselves naturally.

**Strategy 3: Remove Institutional Barriers**

The third strategy is removing barriers—identifying and addressing how institutional formation has suppressed movement DNA. This requires recognizing how professional clergy suppresses APEST, how buildings suppress organic systems, how programs suppress disciple-making, how maintenance suppresses mission.

Removing barriers isn't about abandoning everything institutional—it's about recognizing what suppresses movement and intentionally working to remove those barriers. It requires paradigm shifts, structural changes, and cultural transformation. It's not easy—but it's necessary if we want to reactivate the forgotten ways.

**Strategy 4: Create Movement Culture**

The fourth strategy is creating culture—developing environments where the forgotten ways can express themselves. This isn't about programs—it's about creating cultures where apostolic genius can activate.

Movement cultures prioritize multiplication over addition, decentralization over centralization, release over control, mission over maintenance, discipleship over programs, Jesus' lordship over cultural accommodation. They create environments where the forgotten ways can express themselves naturally.

Creating movement culture requires intentionality. It's not accidental—it's designed. We create cultures where the forgotten ways can thrive.

### Movement Restoration: Recovering What We've Lost

Reactivating the forgotten ways requires movement restoration—recovering what we've lost through centuries of institutional formation. This isn't about abandoning everything contemporary—it's about recovering what's been lost and integrating it with what's been gained.

Movement restoration begins with recognizing what we've lost. We've lost the centrality of Jesus' lordship. We've lost disciple-making as core function. We've lost mission as sent nature. We've lost APEST that releases all people. We've lost organic systems that enable multiplication. We've lost liminality-communitas that forms missional community.

Movement restoration requires recovery—working to restore what's been lost. We recover Jesus' lordship by choosing allegiance to Jesus over cultural authorities. We recover disciple-making by making it our core function. We recover mission by going to people. We recover APEST by releasing all people. We recover organic systems by decentralizing structures. We recover liminality-communitas by engaging risky mission.

Movement restoration demands integration—combining recovered patterns with contemporary insights. We're not trying to recreate the past—we're trying to recover what worked, then integrate it with what we've learned.

### Forgotten Ways Implementation: Contemporary Expression

How do the forgotten ways express themselves in contemporary contexts? What do they look like in our cities, our cultures, our times?

**Jesus is Lord** in contemporary contexts means choosing allegiance to Jesus over consumerism, individualism, nationalism, or any other competing loyalty. It means orienting our lives, decisions, and structures around the kingdom of God, not the kingdoms of this world.

**Disciple-making** in contemporary contexts happens through relationships where new followers learn from those who led them to faith. It's organic, relational, and multipliable—not dependent on programs or professional leaders.

**Mission** in contemporary contexts means going to people rather than asking them to come to us. It means engaging diverse cultures, adapting to contexts, and incarnating the gospel in neighborhoods, workplaces, and communities.

**APEST culture** in contemporary contexts means releasing all of God's people—not just professional clergy—to function according to their design. Apostles extend, prophets speak, evangelists proclaim, shepherds care, teachers ground.

**Organic systems** in contemporary contexts enable multiplication through decentralized, distributed structures. Simple churches, missional communities, networks, and informal leadership structures allow movement to spread without centralized control.

**Liminality-communitas** in contemporary contexts forms when we engage risky mission that pushes us beyond comfort zones. It happens when we choose to serve the marginalized, engage the broken, or step into contexts that require us to depend on God and one another.

These are the forgotten ways—adapted for contemporary expression, recovered from historical patterns, reactivated in movement contexts.

## Case Studies: The Forgotten Ways in Action

To understand the forgotten ways fully, we need to see how they've expressed themselves throughout history. Historical examples help us grasp what these patterns look like when reactivated.

### Early Church: 25,000 to 20 Million

The early church represents the forgotten ways in their purest form. Starting with perhaps 120 people on Pentecost, the church grew to an estimated 25,000 by the end of the first century. By AD 310, despite persecution, the church had grown to approximately 20 million.

All six elements of mDNA were present and active. Jesus is Lord was the costly reality that oriented everything. Disciple-making happened through relationships. Mission sent the church into diverse cultures. APEST culture released every member. Organic systems enabled multiplication through households and networks. Liminality-communitas formed communities around shared mission in the face of persecution.

The early church didn't have programs, strategies, or professional clergy. They had the forgotten ways—and it was enough.

### Chinese Underground Church: 2 Million to 120 Million

The Chinese underground church demonstrates the forgotten ways reactivated in contemporary context. Starting with perhaps 2 million believers in 1949, the church grew to an estimated 120 million by the turn of the century—all while operating illegally, facing persecution, and having no access to buildings, programs, or professional leadership.

Again, all six elements were present. Jesus is Lord meant risking everything. Disciple-making happened through relationships and obedience. Mission engaged Chinese culture deeply. APEST culture released every believer to function. Organic systems enabled decentralized multiplication. Liminality-communitas formed communities in the face of constant threat.

The Chinese church didn't have what we would consider "church" structures. They had the forgotten ways—and it was more than enough.

### Methodist Movement: Wesley's Reactivation

The Methodist movement under John Wesley shows the forgotten ways reactivating after centuries of institutional formation. Starting with small groups meeting in homes, the movement grew to transform Britain and influence the world.

What made it work? The forgotten ways were reactivated. Jesus is Lord oriented everything. Disciple-making happened through class meetings and bands. Mission engaged the working classes that the established church had abandoned. APEST culture released lay preachers and class leaders. Organic systems enabled multiplication through circuits and societies. Liminality-communitas formed communities among those on the margins.

The Methodist movement didn't work because of Wesley's brilliance alone—it worked because the forgotten ways were reactivated.

### Contemporary Movements: Reactivating Today

Today, we're seeing the forgotten ways reactivate in contemporary contexts. Church Multiplication Associates (CMA) demonstrates all six elements working together. Simple churches multiply across contexts. Disciple-making happens through Life Transformation Groups. Mission engages diverse people groups. APEST culture releases every member. Organic systems enable viral multiplication. Liminality-communitas forms communities around shared mission.

Similar patterns are emerging in movements around the world—not because of programs or strategies, but because the forgotten ways are being reactivated. The movement DNA that lies dormant in every church is being awakened, and movement capacity is being released.

## Common Challenges in Reactivating the Forgotten Ways

While the forgotten ways are latent in every church, reactivating them faces real challenges. Understanding these challenges helps us address them intentionally.

### Institutional Resistance: Systems That Suppress

One challenge is institutional resistance—systems designed for stability often resist the dynamics that enable movement. Professional clergy may resist APEST culture that releases all people. Buildings may resist organic systems that enable multiplication. Programs may resist disciple-making that happens relationally. Maintenance may resist mission that sends us out.

This resistance is real and significant. Overcoming it requires paradigm shifts, structural changes, and cultural transformation. It's not easy—but it's necessary if we want to reactivate the forgotten ways.

### Pattern Recovery: Remembering What We've Forgotten

Another challenge is pattern recovery—remembering what we've forgotten through centuries of institutional formation. The forgotten ways aren't immediately obvious. They've been buried beneath layers of structure, control, and maintenance.

Recovering patterns requires careful study, honest assessment, and intentional activation. We must learn from history, evaluate current practice, and work intentionally to reactivate what's dormant. It's not automatic—it requires persistent effort.

### Reactivation Barriers: Overcoming Inertia

A third challenge is reactivation barriers—overcoming the inertia of institutional patterns that resist change. When systems have functioned one way for decades, they resist fundamental shifts. Professional clergy resist releasing all people. Buildings resist decentralization. Programs resist relational disciple-making. Maintenance resists mission.

These barriers are real, but they can be overcome. It requires courage to challenge inherited patterns, persistence to maintain new patterns, and wisdom to adapt patterns for contexts.

### Contemporary Application: Adapting for Our Times

A fourth challenge is contemporary application—adapting historical patterns for contemporary contexts. We can't simply copy what worked then. We must adapt patterns while maintaining principles.

This requires wisdom and discernment. We need to understand principles behind practices, then creatively adapt those principles for our contexts. We're recovering the forgotten ways, then expressing them in contemporary ways. We're learning from history, then adapting for our times.

## Integration: The Forgotten Ways and Apostolic Genius

The forgotten ways connect directly to apostolic genius—they're the historical expression of apostolic genius when fully active. Understanding this connection helps us see how to reactivate movement capacity.

### Connection to Apostolic Genius

The forgotten ways are the historical expression of apostolic genius. When we study the forgotten ways, we're seeing how the six elements of mDNA expressed themselves in those first three centuries and throughout history.

Jesus is Lord patterns show us how the lordship of Jesus reshaped communities. Disciple-making patterns show us how followers multiplied. Missional-incarnational patterns show us how the church engaged culture. APEST culture patterns show us how all functions were expressed. Organic systems patterns show us how decentralized structures enabled multiplication. Liminality-communitas patterns show us how persecution formed missional community.

Understanding this connection helps us see that reactivating the forgotten ways and activating apostolic genius are the same reality—rediscovering what's always been there, encoded in the DNA of God's people.

### Connection to Early Church Patterns

The forgotten ways are identical to early church patterns—they're the ways of the early church that we've forgotten. When we reactivate the forgotten ways, we're recovering early church patterns for contemporary expression.

This connection helps us see that we're not creating something new—we're recovering what's ancient. We're not inventing movement capacity—we're reactivating what's latent. We're not building from scratch—we're rediscovering what's always been there.

### Connection to mDNA Framework

The forgotten ways provide the historical foundation for understanding the mDNA framework. The framework isn't theoretical—it's historical. The six elements aren't modern inventions—they're ancient realities expressed in the forgotten ways.

When we understand how the forgotten ways correspond to mDNA elements, we gain confidence that activating apostolic genius in our contexts will produce similar results. The framework has historical validation through the forgotten ways.

### Connection to All Portals

The forgotten ways connect to all portal themes because they represent apostolic genius in its purest form. Whether we're exploring discipleship, mission, leadership, systems, or transformation, the forgotten ways show us how these themes express themselves when apostolic genius is fully active.

Understanding these connections helps us see that the forgotten ways aren't one theme among many—they're the historical foundation that validates all themes. They show us that movement isn't theoretical—it's historical and available.

## Conclusion: Rediscovering What We've Forgotten

**The forgotten ways** represent the ancient patterns that reactivate missional church movements—patterns that have been buried beneath centuries of institutional formation but remain latent in every local church. They're not lost—just forgotten. They're not missing—just dormant. They're waiting to be rediscovered and reactivated.

The early church experienced them. Historical movements experienced them. Contemporary movements are experiencing them today. The question isn't whether the forgotten ways exist—they do, and they've been demonstrated throughout history. The question is whether we'll rediscover them and reactivate them in our contexts.

Reactivating the forgotten ways requires pattern rediscovery, reactivation strategies, movement restoration, and forgotten ways implementation. It requires wisdom to adapt principles for contexts, courage to challenge institutional structures, and persistence to maintain new patterns.

But it's worth it. When the forgotten ways are reactivated and apostolic genius activates, we see multiplication instead of addition. We see resilience instead of fragility. We see transformation instead of maintenance. We see movement instead of institution.

The forgotten ways are waiting to be rediscovered. The movement DNA is waiting to be reactivated. The question is: Will we remember what we've forgotten? Will we reactivate what's dormant? Will we unlock the movement capacity that lies within us?

I believe we can. I believe we must. Because the world needs movements that transform contexts and multiply disciples. And the forgotten ways show us the way.
