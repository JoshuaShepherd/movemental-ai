## Introduction

What if deep community isn't formed in comfortable spaces, but in the crucible of shared adventure and mission? What if the strongest bonds aren't created through programs and activities, but through facing challenges together? What if authentic togetherness emerges when people share liminal experiences, not just comfortable gatherings?

Most organizations today focus on community—shared interests, comfortable spaces, and similar backgrounds. They create safe environments, predictable routines, and controlled experiences. These community-focused spaces work for connection and belonging, but they struggle with depth and transformation. They create surface-level relationships, but they don't forge deep bonds. They maintain connection, but they don't multiply movements.

**Communitas** represents a different approach—one that recognizes that deep community forms when people share liminal experiences, face challenges together, and engage in shared mission. Communitas is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share threshold experiences. It's community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Communitas is the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. When communitas is present, deep community forms and movements multiply. When it's absent, surface community remains and movements maintain. When communitas is present, disciples are formed together. When it's absent, consumers are created individually.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore communitas from multiple angles. We'll examine what communitas is and why shared adventure creates deep community, understand how to create communitas in your context, discover principles for maintaining communitas, learn from historical examples of communitas, address common challenges to creating communitas, and see how communitas integrates with other movement frameworks. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of how communitas functions as the foundation for deep community and movement multiplication.

The stakes are high. The Western church has focused on community through programs and activities, creating surface-level relationships that maintain but don't transform. But the early church experienced communitas through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. These shared experiences created deep bonds and multiplication. The solution isn't to work harder with community programs. The solution is to recover communitas that enables deep community.

## Framework Foundation: Understanding Communitas

### The Biblical Foundation

Communitas finds its foundation in the biblical narrative of deep community formed through shared adventure and mission. Throughout Scripture, we see communitas emerging when people face challenges together.

The early church experienced communitas through shared mission (Acts 2:42-47). They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer. They shared everything in common, sold possessions to help those in need, and met together daily. This shared mission created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church experienced communitas through persecution (Acts 4:23-31). When they faced threats together, they prayed together, experienced the Holy Spirit together, and spoke the word of God boldly together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church experienced communitas through shared adventure (Acts 13:1-3). When they sent missionaries, they fasted and prayed together, laid hands on them together, and sent them off together. This shared adventure created deep bonds and multiplication.

Paul and his companions experienced communitas through shared mission (Acts 16:19-40). When they faced imprisonment together, they prayed and sang together, experienced deliverance together, and led their jailer to faith together. This shared challenge created deep bonds and multiplication.

These biblical examples reveal how communitas forms: through shared mission, shared hardship, and shared adventure that create deep bonds and enable multiplication. Communitas isn't comfortable, but it's essential.

### Defining Communitas

**Communitas** is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences. It's community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

Communitas has several key characteristics:

**Shared Experience**: Communitas forms through shared experience—facing challenges together, engaging in mission together, experiencing liminality together. This shared experience creates deep bonds.

**Mutual Dependence**: Communitas requires mutual dependence—relying on one another, supporting one another, depending on one another in challenge and mission. This mutual dependence creates deep bonds.

**Common Purpose**: Communitas centers on common purpose—shared mission, shared challenge, shared adventure beyond individual interests. This common purpose creates deep bonds.

**Deep Bonds**: Communitas creates deep bonds—friendship forged in crisis, belonging that emerges from shared challenge, togetherness that forms through mutual dependence. These deep bonds enable multiplication.

**Transformation**: Communitas enables transformation—deep change that happens when people face challenges together, grow together, and multiply together. This transformation enables movement multiplication.

### The Communitas Principle

The core principle of communitas is: **Deep community forms through shared adventure, not through comfortable programs.** This principle recognizes that communitas is essential for authentic discipleship. The more we share liminal experiences, the more deep community forms. The more we focus on comfort, the more surface community remains.

This principle applies across all dimensions:
- **Community**: Communitas creates deep bonds; community creates surface connections
- **Discipleship**: Communitas discipleship transforms together; community discipleship maintains individually
- **Mission**: Communitas mission multiplies; community mission maintains
- **Growth**: Communitas growth transforms; community growth maintains

The key insight is that communitas enables deep community. When we share liminal experiences, we create bonds that enable transformation and multiplication. When we focus on comfort, we create connections that maintain the status quo.

### The Distinction from Community

The distinction between community and communitas is crucial. Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?" Community is maintained through programs and activities. Communitas is maintained through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself.

This distinction matters because:
- **Community** creates surface connections that maintain but don't transform
- **Communitas** creates deep bonds that transform and multiply
- **Community** focuses on individual needs and interests
- **Communitas** focuses on shared purpose and mission
- **Community** is comfortable and safe
- **Communitas** is challenging and transformative

The key is recognizing that both are needed, but communitas is essential for movement multiplication.

### The Mission Focus

Communitas focuses on mission, not just relationship. It forms around shared purpose beyond individual interests, creating bonds that enable multiplication. This means creating communitas through shared mission, not just shared activities.

Mission focus requires:
- **Shared Purpose**: Common mission that goes beyond individual interests
- **Shared Challenge**: Facing challenges together that require mutual support
- **Shared Adventure**: Engaging in adventure together that creates dependence
- **Shared Transformation**: Growing together through shared experience

This mission focus enables multiplication because it creates bonds around purpose, not just comfort, enabling movement capacity.

## Practical Application: Creating Communitas

### Principles for Communitas

Creating communitas requires several key principles:

**Share Liminal Experiences**: Intentionally create shared threshold experiences that place people in transition, outside normal structures, dependent on God and one another.

**Face Challenges Together**: Engage in challenges that require mutual support, shared responsibility, and common purpose.

**Engage in Shared Mission**: Create shared mission that goes beyond individual interests, creating bonds around purpose.

**Foster Mutual Dependence**: Create situations that require reliance on one another, not just individual resources or institutional support.

**Maintain Purpose Focus**: Keep focus on shared purpose and mission, not just comfort and connection.

### Creating Shared Liminal Experiences

Communitas forms through shared liminal experiences—threshold moments that people face together, creating deep bonds through mutual dependence.

Shared liminal experiences might include:
- **Mission Adventures**: Engaging in mission together that requires risk, uncertainty, and dependence
- **Cross-Cultural Experiences**: Stepping into different cultures together that create disorientation and new understanding
- **Service Projects**: Engaging in service together that challenges comfort and creates dependence
- **Shared Challenges**: Facing challenges together that require mutual support and dependence
- **Retreat Experiences**: Creating spaces together for reflection, challenge, and transformation

These shared liminal experiences create communitas because they place people in transition together, outside normal structures, dependent on God and one another.

### Facing Challenges Together

Communitas forms when people face challenges together—situations that require mutual support, shared responsibility, and common purpose.

Facing challenges together might include:
- **Resource Limitations**: Creating situations with limited resources that require creativity and mutual support
- **Skill Challenges**: Engaging in activities together that require learning and mutual support
- **Uncertain Outcomes**: Facing situations together where outcomes are uncertain and require faith
- **Shared Responsibility**: Creating shared responsibility that requires mutual support
- **Persecution and Opposition**: Facing opposition together that requires mutual support and courage

This facing challenges together creates communitas because it requires mutual support and creates deep bonds through shared experience.

### Engaging in Shared Mission

Communitas forms around shared mission—common purpose that goes beyond individual interests, creating bonds around mission.

Engaging in shared mission might include:
- **Neighborhood Engagement**: Engaging in mission together in local neighborhoods
- **Cross-Cultural Mission**: Engaging in mission together across cultural boundaries
- **Justice Work**: Engaging in justice work together that requires shared commitment
- **Discipleship Mission**: Making disciples together that requires shared responsibility
- **Multiplication Mission**: Multiplying communities together that requires shared vision

This engaging in shared mission creates communitas because it creates bonds around purpose, not just comfort, enabling multiplication.

### Fostering Mutual Dependence

Communitas requires mutual dependence—creating situations that require reliance on one another, not just individual resources or institutional support.

Fostering mutual dependence might include:
- **Resource Sharing**: Sharing resources together that requires mutual support
- **Skill Sharing**: Sharing skills together that requires mutual learning
- **Support Structures**: Creating support structures that require mutual care
- **Accountability**: Creating accountability that requires mutual responsibility
- **Prayer and Intercession**: Praying together that requires mutual dependence on God

This fostering mutual dependence creates communitas because it requires reliance on one another, creating deep bonds through mutual support.

### Maintaining Purpose Focus

Communitas requires maintaining purpose focus—keeping focus on shared purpose and mission, not just comfort and connection.

Maintaining purpose focus might include:
- **Mission Clarity**: Keeping mission clear and central to community life
- **Purpose Reminders**: Regularly reminding one another of shared purpose
- **Mission Practices**: Engaging in mission practices together that maintain focus
- **Purpose Evaluation**: Regularly evaluating whether community serves purpose or just comfort
- **Mission Multiplication**: Focusing on multiplication, not just maintenance

This maintaining purpose focus enables communitas because it keeps bonds around purpose, not just comfort, enabling multiplication.

## Case Studies and Examples: Communitas in Action

### The Early Church

The early church demonstrates communitas through shared experiences that created deep bonds and multiplication. The church experienced communitas through shared mission (Acts 2:42-47), devoting themselves to teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer together. This shared mission created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates communitas through persecution. When they faced threats together (Acts 4:23-31), they prayed together, experienced the Holy Spirit together, and spoke the word of God boldly together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates communitas through shared adventure. When they sent missionaries (Acts 13:1-3), they fasted and prayed together, laid hands on them together, and sent them off together. This shared adventure created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates communitas through mutual dependence. When they shared everything in common (Acts 2:44-45), they created mutual dependence that forged deep bonds and enabled multiplication.

### The Methodist Movement

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates communitas through shared experiences that created deep bonds and multiplication. Wesley created communitas through class meetings, where people faced challenges together, shared struggles together, and supported one another together. This shared experience created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates communitas through shared mission. When Methodists engaged in mission together, they faced challenges together, depended on one another, and multiplied together. This shared mission created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates communitas through shared hardship. When Methodists faced persecution together, they supported one another, encouraged one another, and multiplied together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates communitas through mutual dependence. When Methodists shared resources, skills, and support together, they created mutual dependence that forged deep bonds and enabled multiplication.

### Contemporary Movements

Contemporary movements like **CMA (Church Multiplication Associates)**, **Soma**, and **3DM** have intentionally created communitas. They've discovered that when communitas is present, deep community forms and movements multiply.

CMA, for example, creates communitas through church planting adventures. Leaders face challenges together, depend on one another, and multiply together. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

Soma structures their missional communities around communitas. Communities engage in mission together, face challenges together, and depend on one another. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

3DM structures their discipleship around communitas. Disciples face challenges together, engage in mission together, and depend on one another. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

These contemporary movements demonstrate that communitas is achievable when we intentionally create shared liminal experiences. They show that communitas isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we share liminal experiences, face challenges together, and engage in shared mission, communitas forms and multiplication follows.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Communitas

### Comfort Focus

One of the greatest challenges to communitas is comfort focus—the tendency to prioritize comfort, safety, and stability over challenge, risk, and adventure. This focus creates comfortable community that maintains but doesn't transform.

Comfort focus emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, risk aversion, and comfort culture. The result is environments that keep people comfortable but don't create communitas.

The solution is to shift focus from comfort to communitas—embracing challenge, creating shared liminal experiences, and fostering mutual dependence. This requires cultural change and intentional space creation.

### Individualistic Culture

Another challenge to communitas is individualistic culture—the tendency of Western culture to prioritize individual needs, interests, and preferences over shared purpose and mission. This culture prevents communitas because it focuses on individual comfort rather than shared adventure.

Individualistic culture emerges from several factors: consumeristic values, personal preference focus, and individual rights emphasis. The result is environments that serve individuals but don't create communitas.

The solution is to challenge individualistic culture—creating shared purpose, engaging in shared mission, and fostering mutual dependence. Communitas requires shifting from individual to shared focus.

### Programmatic Thinking

Another challenge to communitas is programmatic thinking—the tendency to create programs that provide comfort, structure, and predictability. This thinking prevents communitas because it eliminates the challenge and adventure that create deep bonds.

Programmatic thinking emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, resource management, and outcome focus. The result is programs that maintain connection but don't create communitas.

The solution is to create experiences, not just programs—designing shared liminal experiences that create communitas, not just comfortable activities that maintain connection.

### Safety Focus

Another challenge to communitas is safety focus—the tendency to prioritize safety, control, and predictability over risk, uncertainty, and adventure. This focus prevents communitas because it eliminates the challenge that creates deep bonds.

Safety focus emerges from several factors: risk aversion, control preferences, and comfort culture. The result is environments that are safe but don't create communitas.

The solution is to embrace risk as essential—recognizing that communitas requires challenge, that deep bonds form through shared adventure, and that multiplication requires communitas.

### Surface Connection

Another challenge to communitas is surface connection—the tendency to create connections that are comfortable but not deep, safe but not transformative. This prevents communitas because it maintains connection but doesn't create deep bonds.

Surface connection emerges from several factors: comfort focus, programmatic thinking, and safety focus. The result is connections that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to create deep bonds—sharing liminal experiences, facing challenges together, and engaging in shared mission. Communitas requires depth, not just connection.

## Integration: Communitas and Movement Frameworks

### Connection to Liminality

Communitas connects directly to liminality—the threshold experiences that create the conditions for communitas to form. Liminality creates communitas because shared threshold experiences forge deep bonds through mutual dependence.

When liminality is present, communitas forms. When it's absent, community remains superficial. The connection is direct: liminality creates communitas, and communitas enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to mDNA

Communitas also connects to the mDNA framework as part of element #6 (Liminality-Communitas)—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. Communitas works in relationship with all other mDNA elements, supporting and enabling their function.

When communitas is present, all mDNA elements can function properly. When it's absent, elements struggle to create transformation. The connection is clear: communitas enables mDNA to function as an integrated system.

### Connection to Organic Systems

Communitas also connects to organic systems—the mDNA element that describes how movements organize themselves. Communitas enables organic systems to function properly by creating the deep bonds that enable reproduction and multiplication.

The connection is natural: communitas creates bonds that enable organic systems to reproduce and multiply. When deep community is present, systems can reproduce. When it's absent, systems become individualistic and limited.

### Connection to Movement Intelligence

Communitas also connects to Movement Intelligence (MQ)—the framework for understanding movement quality and multiplication capacity. Communitas creates high movement intelligence by enabling deep community, transformation, and multiplication.

The connection is essential: communitas creates movement intelligence, and movement intelligence enables multiplication. When deep community is present, movement intelligence increases and multiplication follows.

### Holistic Movement Thinking

Communitas is part of holistic movement thinking—the recognition that all mDNA elements work together as an integrated system. Communitas isn't isolated from other elements. It's connected to liminality, organic systems, movement intelligence, and all mDNA elements.

When we think holistically about movement, we see that communitas is essential for movement multiplication. It's not optional or peripheral. It's central. Without communitas, movements can't form deep bonds. Without communitas, movements can't multiply. Without communitas, movements become individualistic and limited.

## Conclusion

Communitas isn't about creating uncomfortable or dangerous environments. It's about creating shared experiences that enable deep community. When communitas is present, deep bonds form and movements multiply. When it's absent, surface connections remain and movements maintain.

The path forward is clear: share liminal experiences, face challenges together, engage in shared mission, foster mutual dependence, and maintain purpose focus. This isn't easy work, but it's essential work. The Western church has focused on community through programs, and the solution isn't to work harder with community programs. The solution is to recover communitas that enables deep community.

The stakes are high. Communitas enables deep community. Community enables surface connection. Communitas creates disciples together. Community creates consumers individually. The choice is ours: will we create communitas that enables deep community, or will we continue with community that limits our capacity?

The early church, historical movements, and contemporary examples all demonstrate that communitas is achievable when we intentionally create shared liminal experiences. They show that communitas isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we share liminal experiences, face challenges together, and engage in shared mission, communitas forms and multiplication follows.

The question is whether we'll have the courage to create communitas. Will we share liminal experiences? Will we face challenges together? Will we engage in shared mission? Will we foster mutual dependence?

The future of the missional movement depends on communitas. Without it, we maintain. With it, we multiply. The choice is ours.

**Next Steps**: Evaluate your current community for communitas. Is it deep or surface? Does it form through shared adventure or comfortable programs? Create shared liminal experiences, face challenges together, engage in shared mission, and foster mutual dependence. Maintain purpose focus, not just comfort focus.
