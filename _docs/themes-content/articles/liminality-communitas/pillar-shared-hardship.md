## Introduction

What if deep community isn't formed in comfortable spaces, but in the crucible of shared hardship? What if the strongest bonds aren't created through programs and activities, but through facing challenges together? What if authentic togetherness emerges when people suffer together, not just celebrate together?

Most organizations today focus on comfort and celebration—creating safe environments, positive experiences, and enjoyable activities. These comfortable spaces work for connection and belonging, but they struggle with depth and transformation. They create surface-level relationships, but they don't forge deep bonds. They maintain connection, but they don't multiply movements.

**Shared hardship** represents a different approach—one that recognizes that deep community forms when people face challenges together, suffer together, and overcome together. Shared hardship is the experience of facing difficulty, challenge, and suffering together, creating deep bonds through mutual support and dependence. It's community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared struggle, belonging that emerges from facing hardship together.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Shared hardship is essential for communitas—the deep community that enables movements to form and thrive. When shared hardship is present, communitas forms and movements multiply. When it's absent, surface community remains and movements maintain. When shared hardship is present, disciples are formed together. When it's absent, consumers are created individually.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore shared hardship from multiple angles. We'll examine what shared hardship is and why mutual suffering creates deep community, understand how to create shared hardship experiences in your context, discover principles for navigating hardship together, learn from historical examples of shared hardship, address common challenges to embracing hardship, and see how shared hardship integrates with other movement frameworks. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of how shared hardship functions as the foundation for deep community and movement multiplication.

The stakes are high. The Western church has focused on comfort and celebration, creating surface-level relationships that maintain but don't transform. But the early church experienced shared hardship through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. These shared experiences created deep bonds and multiplication. The solution isn't to work harder with comfortable programs. The solution is to recover shared hardship that enables deep community.

## Framework Foundation: Understanding Shared Hardship

### The Biblical Foundation

Shared hardship finds its foundation in the biblical narrative of deep community formed through mutual suffering and challenge. Throughout Scripture, we see shared hardship creating deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church experienced shared hardship through persecution (Acts 4:23-31). When they faced threats together, they prayed together, experienced the Holy Spirit together, and spoke the word of God boldly together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church experienced shared hardship through mission (Acts 13:1-3). When they sent missionaries, they fasted and prayed together, laid hands on them together, and sent them off together. This shared challenge created deep bonds and multiplication.

Paul and his companions experienced shared hardship through imprisonment (Acts 16:19-40). When they faced imprisonment together, they prayed and sang together, experienced deliverance together, and led their jailer to faith together. This shared suffering created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church experienced shared hardship through material need (Acts 2:44-45). When they shared everything in common, they created mutual dependence that forged deep bonds and enabled multiplication.

Jesus experienced shared hardship with his disciples (John 15:18-21). When he warned them about persecution, he prepared them for shared suffering that would create deep bonds and enable multiplication.

These biblical examples reveal how shared hardship creates deep community: through mutual suffering, shared challenge, and common struggle that forge bonds and enable multiplication. Shared hardship isn't comfortable, but it's essential.

### Defining Shared Hardship

**Shared hardship** is the experience of facing difficulty, challenge, and suffering together, creating deep bonds through mutual support and dependence. It's community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared struggle, belonging that emerges from facing hardship together. Shared hardship is not suffering for its own sake but the experience of facing challenges together that creates communitas.

Shared hardship has several key characteristics:

**Mutual Suffering**: Shared hardship involves mutual suffering—facing difficulty together, experiencing challenge together, enduring hardship together. This mutual suffering creates deep bonds.

**Common Struggle**: Shared hardship centers on common struggle—facing the same challenges, enduring the same difficulties, overcoming the same obstacles together. This common struggle creates deep bonds.

**Mutual Support**: Shared hardship requires mutual support—supporting one another, encouraging one another, depending on one another in hardship. This mutual support creates deep bonds.

**Deep Bonds**: Shared hardship creates deep bonds—friendship forged in crisis, belonging that emerges from shared struggle, togetherness that forms through mutual dependence. These deep bonds enable multiplication.

**Transformation**: Shared hardship enables transformation—deep change that happens when people face challenges together, grow together, and multiply together. This transformation enables movement multiplication.

### The Shared Hardship Principle

The core principle of shared hardship is: **Deep community forms through shared suffering, not through shared comfort.** This principle recognizes that shared hardship is essential for communitas. The more we share hardship, the more deep community forms. The more we focus on comfort, the more surface community remains.

This principle applies across all dimensions:
- **Community**: Shared hardship creates deep bonds; shared comfort creates surface connections
- **Discipleship**: Shared hardship discipleship transforms together; shared comfort discipleship maintains individually
- **Mission**: Shared hardship mission multiplies; shared comfort mission maintains
- **Growth**: Shared hardship growth transforms; shared comfort growth maintains

The key insight is that shared hardship enables deep community. When we face challenges together, we create bonds that enable transformation and multiplication. When we focus on comfort, we create connections that maintain the status quo.

### The Distinction from Individual Suffering

The distinction between shared hardship and individual suffering is crucial. Individual suffering isolates and creates loneliness. Shared hardship unites and creates communitas. Individual suffering asks, "Why me?" Shared hardship asks, "How can we overcome together?"

This distinction matters because:
- **Individual Suffering** creates isolation and loneliness
- **Shared Hardship** creates unity and communitas
- **Individual Suffering** focuses on personal pain
- **Shared Hardship** focuses on mutual support and common purpose
- **Individual Suffering** is endured alone
- **Shared Hardship** is faced together

The key is recognizing that hardship is inevitable, but sharing it creates communitas.

### The Mission Focus

Shared hardship focuses on mission, not just relationship. It forms around shared purpose beyond individual interests, creating bonds that enable multiplication. This means creating shared hardship through mission, not just comfort.

Mission focus requires:
- **Shared Purpose**: Common mission that goes beyond individual interests
- **Shared Challenge**: Facing challenges together that require mutual support
- **Shared Adventure**: Engaging in adventure together that creates dependence
- **Shared Transformation**: Growing together through shared experience

This mission focus enables multiplication because it creates bonds around purpose, not just comfort, enabling movement capacity.

## Practical Application: Creating Shared Hardship Experiences

### Principles for Shared Hardship

Creating shared hardship experiences requires several key principles:

**Face Challenges Together**: Intentionally create situations where people face challenges together, requiring mutual support and common purpose.

**Share Suffering**: Create spaces where people can share their struggles, challenges, and difficulties together, not just individually.

**Support One Another**: Foster mutual support, encouragement, and dependence in hardship.

**Maintain Mission Focus**: Keep focus on shared purpose and mission, not just comfort and connection.

**Enable Transformation**: Provide conditions for transformation to occur through shared hardship.

### Creating Shared Challenges

Shared hardship is created through shared challenges—situations that people face together, requiring mutual support and common purpose.

Shared challenges might include:
- **Mission Challenges**: Engaging in mission together that requires risk, uncertainty, and mutual support
- **Resource Limitations**: Creating situations with limited resources that require creativity and mutual support
- **Skill Challenges**: Engaging in activities together that require learning and mutual support
- **Uncertain Outcomes**: Facing situations together where outcomes are uncertain and require faith
- **Persecution and Opposition**: Facing opposition together that requires mutual support and courage

These shared challenges create shared hardship because they require mutual support and create deep bonds through common struggle.

### Sharing Suffering Together

Shared hardship requires sharing suffering together—creating spaces where people can share their struggles, challenges, and difficulties together, not just individually.

Sharing suffering together might include:
- **Struggle Sharing**: Creating spaces where people can share their struggles together
- **Challenge Processing**: Processing challenges together, not just individually
- **Mutual Encouragement**: Encouraging one another in hardship, not just celebrating success
- **Common Grief**: Grieving together over shared losses and difficulties
- **Prayer and Intercession**: Praying together for one another in hardship

This sharing suffering together creates shared hardship because it creates bonds through mutual vulnerability and support.

### Supporting One Another

Shared hardship requires supporting one another—fostering mutual support, encouragement, and dependence in hardship.

Supporting one another might include:
- **Mutual Support**: Supporting one another in hardship, not just in success
- **Resource Sharing**: Sharing resources together that requires mutual support
- **Skill Sharing**: Sharing skills together that requires mutual learning
- **Emotional Support**: Providing emotional support in hardship, not just celebration
- **Practical Support**: Providing practical support in hardship, not just programs

This supporting one another creates shared hardship because it requires mutual support and creates deep bonds through mutual dependence.

### Maintaining Mission Focus

Shared hardship requires maintaining mission focus—keeping focus on shared purpose and mission, not just comfort and connection.

Maintaining mission focus might include:
- **Mission Clarity**: Keeping mission clear and central to community life
- **Purpose Reminders**: Regularly reminding one another of shared purpose
- **Mission Practices**: Engaging in mission practices together that maintain focus
- **Purpose Evaluation**: Regularly evaluating whether community serves purpose or just comfort
- **Mission Multiplication**: Focusing on multiplication, not just maintenance

This maintaining mission focus enables shared hardship because it keeps bonds around purpose, not just comfort, enabling multiplication.

### Enabling Transformation

Shared hardship enables transformation—providing conditions for deep change to occur through shared experience.

Enabling transformation might include:
- **Processing Together**: Processing hardship together, not just individually
- **Learning Together**: Learning from hardship together, not just individually
- **Growing Together**: Growing through hardship together, not just individually
- **Multiplying Together**: Multiplying through hardship together, not just individually
- **Integration Practices**: Creating practices that help integrate transformation from shared hardship

This enabled transformation creates movement multiplication because it provides the conditions for deep change to occur and be integrated.

## Case Studies and Examples: Shared Hardship in Action

### The Early Church

The early church demonstrates shared hardship through experiences that created deep bonds and multiplication. The church experienced shared hardship through persecution (Acts 4:23-31). When they faced threats together, they prayed together, experienced the Holy Spirit together, and spoke the word of God boldly together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates shared hardship through mission. When they sent missionaries (Acts 13:1-3), they fasted and prayed together, laid hands on them together, and sent them off together. This shared challenge created deep bonds and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates shared hardship through material need. When they shared everything in common (Acts 2:44-45), they created mutual dependence that forged deep bonds and enabled multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates shared hardship through imprisonment. When Paul and his companions faced imprisonment together (Acts 16:19-40), they prayed and sang together, experienced deliverance together, and led their jailer to faith together. This shared suffering created deep bonds and multiplication.

### The Methodist Movement

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates shared hardship through experiences that created deep bonds and multiplication. Wesley created shared hardship through class meetings, where people faced challenges together, shared struggles together, and supported one another together. This shared experience created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates shared hardship through mission. When Methodists engaged in mission together, they faced challenges together, depended on one another, and multiplied together. This shared mission created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates shared hardship through persecution. When Methodists faced persecution together, they supported one another, encouraged one another, and multiplied together. This shared hardship created deep bonds and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates shared hardship through material need. When Methodists shared resources together, they created mutual dependence that forged deep bonds and enabled multiplication.

### Contemporary Movements

Contemporary movements like **CMA (Church Multiplication Associates)**, **Soma**, and **3DM** have intentionally created shared hardship. They've discovered that when shared hardship is present, deep community forms and movements multiply.

CMA, for example, creates shared hardship through church planting adventures. Leaders face challenges together, depend on one another, and multiply together. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

Soma structures their missional communities around shared hardship. Communities engage in mission together, face challenges together, and depend on one another. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

3DM structures their discipleship around shared hardship. Disciples face challenges together, engage in mission together, and depend on one another. This shared experience creates deep bonds and multiplication.

These contemporary movements demonstrate that shared hardship is achievable when we intentionally create shared challenges. They show that shared hardship isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we face challenges together, share suffering together, and support one another, shared hardship forms and multiplication follows.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Shared Hardship

### Comfort Focus

One of the greatest challenges to shared hardship is comfort focus—the tendency to prioritize comfort, safety, and stability over challenge, risk, and hardship. This focus creates comfortable community that maintains but doesn't transform.

Comfort focus emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, risk aversion, and comfort culture. The result is environments that keep people comfortable but don't create shared hardship.

The solution is to shift focus from comfort to shared hardship—embracing challenge, creating shared challenges, and fostering mutual support. This requires cultural change and intentional space creation.

### Individualistic Culture

Another challenge to shared hardship is individualistic culture—the tendency of Western culture to prioritize individual needs, interests, and preferences over shared purpose and mission. This culture prevents shared hardship because it focuses on individual comfort rather than shared challenge.

Individualistic culture emerges from several factors: consumeristic values, personal preference focus, and individual rights emphasis. The result is environments that serve individuals but don't create shared hardship.

The solution is to challenge individualistic culture—creating shared purpose, engaging in shared mission, and fostering mutual support. Shared hardship requires shifting from individual to shared focus.

### Avoidance of Suffering

Another challenge to shared hardship is avoidance of suffering—the tendency to avoid hardship, challenge, and difficulty rather than face them together. This avoidance prevents shared hardship because it eliminates the challenge that creates deep bonds.

Avoidance of suffering emerges from several factors: comfort focus, individualistic culture, and risk aversion. The result is environments that avoid hardship but don't create shared hardship.

The solution is to embrace hardship as essential—recognizing that shared hardship creates communitas, that deep bonds form through shared struggle, and that multiplication requires shared hardship.

### Surface Connection

Another challenge to shared hardship is surface connection—the tendency to create connections that are comfortable but not deep, safe but not transformative. This prevents shared hardship because it maintains connection but doesn't create deep bonds.

Surface connection emerges from several factors: comfort focus, programmatic thinking, and safety focus. The result is connections that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to create deep bonds—facing challenges together, sharing suffering together, and supporting one another. Shared hardship requires depth, not just connection.

### Programmatic Thinking

Another challenge to shared hardship is programmatic thinking—the tendency to create programs that provide comfort, structure, and predictability. This thinking prevents shared hardship because it eliminates the challenge that creates deep bonds.

Programmatic thinking emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, resource management, and outcome focus. The result is programs that maintain connection but don't create shared hardship.

The solution is to create experiences, not just programs—designing shared challenges that create shared hardship, not just comfortable activities that maintain connection.

## Integration: Shared Hardship and Movement Frameworks

### Connection to Communitas

Shared hardship connects directly to communitas—the deep community that forms when people share liminal experiences. Shared hardship creates communitas because mutual suffering forges deep bonds through mutual support and dependence.

When shared hardship is present, communitas forms. When it's absent, community remains superficial. The connection is direct: shared hardship creates communitas, and communitas enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to Liminality

Shared hardship also connects to liminality—the threshold experiences that create the conditions for communitas to form. Shared hardship creates liminality because facing challenges together places people in transition, outside normal structures, dependent on God and one another.

When shared hardship is present, liminality happens. When it's absent, comfort prevails. The connection is clear: shared hardship creates liminality, and liminality enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to mDNA

Shared hardship also connects to the mDNA framework as part of element #6 (Liminality-Communitas)—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. Shared hardship works in relationship with all other mDNA elements, supporting and enabling their function.

When shared hardship is present, all mDNA elements can function properly. When it's absent, elements struggle to create transformation. The connection is clear: shared hardship enables mDNA to function as an integrated system.

### Connection to Movement Intelligence

Shared hardship also connects to Movement Intelligence (MQ)—the framework for understanding movement quality and multiplication capacity. Shared hardship creates high movement intelligence by enabling deep community, transformation, and multiplication.

The connection is essential: shared hardship creates movement intelligence, and movement intelligence enables multiplication. When shared hardship is present, movement intelligence increases and multiplication follows.

### Holistic Movement Thinking

Shared hardship is part of holistic movement thinking—the recognition that all mDNA elements work together as an integrated system. Shared hardship isn't isolated from other elements. It's connected to communitas, liminality, movement intelligence, and all mDNA elements.

When we think holistically about movement, we see that shared hardship is essential for movement multiplication. It's not optional or peripheral. It's central. Without shared hardship, movements can't form deep bonds. Without shared hardship, movements can't multiply. Without shared hardship, movements become individualistic and limited.

## Conclusion

Shared hardship isn't about creating suffering for its own sake. It's about facing challenges together that enable deep community. When shared hardship is present, deep bonds form and movements multiply. When it's absent, surface connections remain and movements maintain.

The path forward is clear: face challenges together, share suffering together, support one another, maintain mission focus, and enable transformation. This isn't easy work, but it's essential work. The Western church has focused on comfort and celebration, and the solution isn't to work harder with comfortable programs. The solution is to recover shared hardship that enables deep community.

The stakes are high. Shared hardship enables deep community. Shared comfort enables surface connection. Shared hardship creates disciples together. Shared comfort creates consumers individually. The choice is ours: will we create shared hardship that enables deep community, or will we continue with shared comfort that limits our capacity?

The early church, historical movements, and contemporary examples all demonstrate that shared hardship is achievable when we intentionally create shared challenges. They show that shared hardship isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we face challenges together, share suffering together, and support one another, shared hardship forms and multiplication follows.

The question is whether we'll have the courage to create shared hardship. Will we face challenges together? Will we share suffering together? Will we support one another? Will we maintain mission focus?

The future of the missional movement depends on shared hardship. Without it, we maintain. With it, we multiply. The choice is ours.
