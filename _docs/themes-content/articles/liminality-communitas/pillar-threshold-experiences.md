## Introduction

What if transformation happens at thresholds—the in-between spaces where we step from one reality into another, leaving behind the familiar and stepping into the unknown? What if the key to authentic discipleship isn't staying in comfortable spaces, but intentionally crossing thresholds that create transformation? What if threshold experiences are the gateway to multiplication?

Most organizations today keep people in familiar spaces—comfortable routines, predictable patterns, and safe environments. These familiar spaces work for maintenance and stability, but they struggle with transformation and multiplication. They keep people comfortable, but they don't create disciples. They maintain the status quo, but they don't multiply movements.

**Threshold experiences** represent a different approach—one that recognizes that transformation happens when we intentionally cross thresholds, step into the unknown, and embrace the in-between spaces. Threshold experiences are those moments when we step from one reality into another, leaving behind the familiar and stepping into the unknown. They create the conditions for transformation because they strip away false securities and force reliance on God and one another.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Threshold experiences are essential for liminality—the mDNA element that enables movements to form and thrive. When threshold experiences are present, liminality happens and movements multiply. When they're absent, comfort prevails and movements maintain. When threshold experiences are present, disciples are formed. When they're absent, consumers are created.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore threshold experiences from multiple angles. We'll examine what threshold experiences are and why they enable transformation, understand how to create threshold experiences in your context, discover principles for navigating thresholds, learn from historical examples of threshold experiences, address common challenges to creating thresholds, and see how threshold experiences integrate with other movement frameworks. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of how threshold experiences function as the foundation for transformation and movement multiplication.

The stakes are high. The Western church has kept people in familiar spaces, creating environments that maintain but don't transform. But the early church experienced threshold moments through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication. The solution isn't to work harder with familiar programs. The solution is to create threshold experiences that enable transformation.

## Framework Foundation: Understanding Threshold Experiences

### The Biblical Foundation

Threshold experiences find their foundation in the biblical narrative of transformation through crossing thresholds. Throughout Scripture, we see threshold moments that create transformation.

Abraham crossed a threshold when God called him to leave his country (Genesis 12:1). He stepped from the familiar into the unknown, leaving behind security for a promise. This threshold experience created transformation and multiplication.

Moses crossed a threshold at the burning bush (Exodus 3). He stepped from hiding into calling, leaving behind safety for mission. This threshold experience created transformation and multiplication.

The Israelites crossed a threshold at the Red Sea (Exodus 14). They stepped from slavery into freedom, leaving behind the familiar for the unknown. This threshold experience created transformation and multiplication.

Jesus crossed thresholds throughout his ministry—from wilderness to ministry, from teaching to healing, from life to death to resurrection. Each threshold created transformation and multiplication.

The early church crossed thresholds through persecution (Acts 8:1-4), scattering from Jerusalem, stepping into new contexts, leaving behind security for mission. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

These biblical examples reveal how threshold experiences create transformation: through stepping from the familiar into the unknown, leaving behind security for mission, creating space for breakthrough. Threshold experiences aren't comfortable, but they're essential.

### Defining Threshold Experiences

**Threshold experiences** are those moments when we step from one reality into another, leaving behind the familiar and stepping into the unknown. They're the in-between spaces where the old hasn't fully passed away and the new hasn't fully arrived. They create the conditions for transformation because they strip away false securities and force reliance on God and one another.

Threshold experiences have several key characteristics:

**Transition**: Threshold experiences occur in transition—stepping from one reality into another, crossing from the familiar to the unknown, moving from what was to what will be.

**Disorientation**: Threshold experiences create disorientation—the familiar is gone, the new isn't yet clear. Normal structures and routines don't apply. This disorientation creates space for new understanding.

**Risk**: Threshold experiences involve risk—stepping into uncertainty, facing the unknown, embracing vulnerability. This risk creates dependence on God and one another.

**Uncertainty**: Threshold experiences bring uncertainty—not knowing what comes next, not having clear answers, not being in control. This uncertainty creates space for faith and trust.

**Potential**: Threshold experiences hold potential—for both failure and breakthrough, for both loss and gain, for both death and new life. This potential creates space for transformation.

### The Threshold Principle

The core principle of threshold experiences is: **Transformation happens when we cross thresholds, not when we stay in familiar spaces.** This principle recognizes that threshold experiences are essential for authentic discipleship. The more we cross thresholds, the more transformation happens. The more we stay in familiar spaces, the more we maintain the status quo.

This principle applies across all dimensions:
- **Discipleship**: Threshold discipleship transforms; familiar discipleship maintains
- **Community**: Threshold community forms deeply; familiar community forms superficially
- **Mission**: Threshold mission multiplies; familiar mission maintains
- **Growth**: Threshold growth transforms; familiar growth maintains

The key insight is that threshold experiences enable transformation. When we cross thresholds, we create space for God to work, for growth to happen, for multiplication to occur. When we stay in familiar spaces, we maintain the status quo.

### The In-Between Space

Threshold experiences occur in the in-between space—where the old hasn't fully passed away and the new hasn't fully arrived. This in-between space creates the conditions for transformation because it strips away false securities and forces reliance on God.

The in-between space requires:
- **Letting Go**: Releasing the familiar, the comfortable, the known
- **Stepping Into**: Embracing the unknown, the uncertain, the new
- **Holding Tension**: Maintaining tension between old and new, familiar and unknown
- **Trusting God**: Depending on God in the uncertainty, not just personal resources

This in-between space enables transformation because it creates the conditions for breakthrough while maintaining enough safety for growth.

### The Transformation Focus

Threshold experiences focus on transformation, not just information or inspiration. They create the conditions for deep change, not just surface-level learning. This means creating threshold experiences that strip away false securities and force reliance on God.

Transformation requires:
- **Stripping Away**: Removing false securities, comfortable routines, and safe assumptions
- **Forcing Dependence**: Creating situations that require reliance on God and one another
- **Creating Space**: Making room for new understanding, new practices, new identity
- **Enabling Breakthrough**: Providing conditions for transformation to occur

This transformation focus enables authentic discipleship because it creates the conditions for deep change, not just surface-level learning.

## Practical Application: Creating Threshold Experiences

### Principles for Threshold Experiences

Creating threshold experiences requires several key principles:

**Intentionally Cross Thresholds**: Design experiences that place people in transition, stepping from the familiar into the unknown.

**Create In-Between Spaces**: Make space for the in-between—where the old hasn't fully passed away and the new hasn't fully arrived.

**Strip Away False Securities**: Remove comfortable routines, safe assumptions, and predictable patterns that prevent transformation.

**Force Dependence**: Create situations that require reliance on God and one another, not just personal resources or institutional support.

**Enable Breakthrough**: Provide conditions for transformation to occur—space, time, support, and challenge.

### Creating Intentional Thresholds

Threshold experiences are created through intentional design—placing people in transition, stepping from the familiar into the unknown.

Intentional thresholds might include:
- **Mission Adventures**: Engaging in mission that requires stepping into new contexts, facing uncertainty, and depending on God
- **Cross-Cultural Experiences**: Stepping into different cultures that create disorientation and new understanding
- **Service Projects**: Engaging in service that challenges comfort and creates dependence
- **Retreat Experiences**: Creating spaces for reflection, challenge, and transformation
- **Shared Challenges**: Facing challenges together that require mutual support and dependence

These intentional thresholds create transformation because they place people in transition, outside normal structures, dependent on God and one another.

### Creating In-Between Spaces

Threshold experiences require in-between spaces—where the old hasn't fully passed away and the new hasn't fully arrived.

Creating in-between spaces might include:
- **Transition Times**: Creating intentional times of transition between seasons, contexts, or phases
- **Reflection Spaces**: Making space for reflection on what was and what will be
- **Processing Time**: Allowing time to process the transition, not rushing to the new
- **Holding Tension**: Maintaining tension between old and new, familiar and unknown
- **Support Structures**: Providing support during the in-between, not just before or after

These in-between spaces enable transformation because they create the conditions for breakthrough while maintaining enough safety for growth.

### Stripping Away False Securities

Threshold experiences require stripping away false securities—comfortable routines, safe assumptions, and predictable patterns that prevent transformation.

Stripping away false securities might include:
- **Challenging Comfort**: Intentionally disrupting comfortable routines and safe patterns
- **Questioning Assumptions**: Challenging assumptions that prevent growth and transformation
- **Creating Uncertainty**: Introducing uncertainty that requires faith and trust
- **Breaking Patterns**: Disrupting patterns that maintain the status quo
- **Forcing Dependence**: Creating situations that require reliance on God and one another

This stripping away of false securities creates transformation because it removes what prevents change and creates space for breakthrough.

### Forcing Dependence

Threshold experiences force dependence—creating situations that require reliance on God and one another, not just personal resources or institutional support.

Forcing dependence might include:
- **Resource Limitations**: Creating situations with limited resources that require creativity and dependence
- **Skill Challenges**: Engaging in activities that require learning and mutual support
- **Uncertain Outcomes**: Facing situations where outcomes are uncertain and require faith
- **Shared Responsibility**: Creating shared responsibility that requires mutual support
- **Spiritual Practices**: Engaging in practices that require dependence on God

This forced dependence creates transformation because it requires reliance on God and one another, creating the conditions for breakthrough.

### Enabling Breakthrough

Threshold experiences enable breakthrough—providing conditions for transformation to occur.

Enabling breakthrough might include:
- **Space for Reflection**: Creating time and space for reflection, processing, and understanding
- **Support Structures**: Providing support, guidance, and care during threshold experiences
- **Challenge and Encouragement**: Balancing challenge that stretches with encouragement that supports
- **Integration Practices**: Creating practices that help integrate transformation into daily life
- **Follow-Up Support**: Providing ongoing support after threshold experiences

This enabled breakthrough creates transformation because it provides the conditions for deep change to occur and be integrated.

## Case Studies and Examples: Threshold Experiences in Action

### The Early Church

The early church demonstrates threshold experiences through moments that created transformation and multiplication. The church crossed thresholds through persecution (Acts 8:1-4), scattering from Jerusalem, stepping into new contexts, leaving behind security for mission. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates threshold experiences through mission. When the church sent missionaries (Acts 13:1-3), they stepped into uncertainty, leaving behind security for mission. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates threshold experiences through cross-cultural engagement. When Peter engaged with Cornelius (Acts 10), he stepped into disorientation, challenging assumptions, depending on the Holy Spirit. This threshold experience created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates threshold experiences through shared challenges. When the church faced persecution together (Acts 4:23-31), they experienced threshold together, depending on God and one another. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

### The Methodist Movement

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates threshold experiences through moments that created transformation and multiplication. Wesley created threshold experiences through field preaching, stepping outside normal structures, engaging with people on the margins. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates threshold experiences through class meetings. These small groups created threshold moments through accountability, challenge, and mutual support. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates threshold experiences through mission engagement. When Methodists engaged in mission, they stepped into uncertainty, facing challenges, depending on God and one another. These threshold experiences created transformation and multiplication.

The Methodist movement also demonstrates threshold experiences through shared hardship. When Methodists faced persecution and challenge together, they experienced threshold together, creating deep community and transformation.

### Contemporary Movements

Contemporary movements like **CMA (Church Multiplication Associates)**, **Soma**, and **3DM** have intentionally created threshold experiences. They've discovered that when threshold experiences are present, transformation happens and movements multiply.

CMA, for example, creates threshold experiences through church planting adventures. Leaders step into uncertainty, face challenges, and depend on God and one another. These threshold experiences create transformation and multiplication.

Soma structures their missional communities around threshold engagement. Communities engage at the edges of society, face challenges together, and depend on God and one another. These threshold experiences create transformation and multiplication.

3DM structures their discipleship around threshold experiences. Disciples step into threshold through mission, challenge, and adventure. These threshold experiences create transformation and multiplication.

These contemporary movements demonstrate that threshold experiences are achievable when we intentionally create in-between spaces. They show that threshold experiences aren't theoretical—they're practical and achievable. When we cross thresholds, create in-between spaces, and force dependence, transformation follows.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Threshold Experiences

### Safety Focus

One of the greatest challenges to threshold experiences is safety focus—the tendency to prioritize safety, comfort, and stability over risk, challenge, and adventure. This focus keeps people in familiar spaces that maintain but don't transform.

Safety focus emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, risk aversion, and comfort culture. The result is environments that keep people comfortable but don't create threshold experiences.

The solution is to shift focus from safety to transformation—embracing risk, creating threshold experiences, and forcing dependence. This requires cultural change and intentional space creation.

### Comfort Culture

Another challenge to threshold experiences is comfort culture—the tendency of middle-class culture to prioritize security, consumption, and risk-aversion. This culture prevents threshold experiences because it keeps people in familiar spaces.

Comfort culture emerges from several factors: material security, consumeristic values, and risk-aversion. The result is environments that prioritize comfort over transformation.

The solution is to challenge comfort culture—intentionally creating threshold experiences, engaging at the edges of society, and embracing risk as essential for transformation.

### Control Tendency

Another challenge to threshold experiences is control tendency—the tendency to try to control outcomes, eliminate uncertainty, and manage risk. This tendency prevents threshold experiences because it eliminates the uncertainty that creates transformation.

Control tendency emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, risk management, and outcome focus. The result is environments that control but don't transform.

The solution is to embrace uncertainty—creating threshold experiences that require faith and trust, not control and management. Threshold experiences require letting go of control.

### Programmatic Thinking

Another challenge to threshold experiences is programmatic thinking—the tendency to create programs that provide safety, structure, and predictability. This thinking prevents threshold experiences because it eliminates the uncertainty that creates transformation.

Programmatic thinking emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, resource management, and outcome focus. The result is programs that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to create experiences, not just programs—designing threshold experiences that create transformation, not just safe activities that maintain comfort.

### Familiar Space Preference

Another challenge to threshold experiences is familiar space preference—the tendency to prefer familiar spaces over threshold experiences. This preference prevents transformation because it keeps people in comfortable routines.

Familiar space preference emerges from several factors: safety focus, comfort culture, and control tendency. The result is environments that maintain familiarity but don't create transformation.

The solution is to embrace threshold experiences as essential—recognizing that transformation requires crossing thresholds, that discipleship requires stepping into the unknown, and that multiplication requires threshold experiences.

## Integration: Threshold Experiences and Movement Frameworks

### Connection to Liminality

Threshold experiences connect directly to liminality—the mDNA element that describes threshold experiences as essential for transformation. Threshold experiences create liminality because they place people in transition, outside normal structures, dependent on God and one another.

When threshold experiences are present, liminality happens. When they're absent, comfort prevails. The connection is direct: threshold experiences create liminality, and liminality enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to Communitas

Threshold experiences also connect to communitas—the deep community that forms when people share liminal experiences. Threshold experiences create communitas because shared threshold moments forge deep bonds through mutual dependence.

When threshold experiences are shared, communitas forms. When they're individual, community remains superficial. The connection is clear: shared threshold experiences create communitas, and communitas enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to mDNA

Threshold experiences also connect to the mDNA framework as part of element #6 (Liminality-Communitas)—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. Threshold experiences work in relationship with all other mDNA elements, supporting and enabling their function.

When threshold experiences are present, all mDNA elements can function properly. When they're absent, elements struggle to create transformation. The connection is clear: threshold experiences enable mDNA to function as an integrated system.

### Connection to Movement Intelligence

Threshold experiences also connect to Movement Intelligence (MQ)—the framework for understanding movement quality and multiplication capacity. Threshold experiences create high movement intelligence by enabling transformation, adaptation, and multiplication.

The connection is essential: threshold experiences create movement intelligence, and movement intelligence enables multiplication. When threshold experiences are present, movement intelligence increases and multiplication follows.

### Holistic Movement Thinking

Threshold experiences are part of holistic movement thinking—the recognition that all mDNA elements work together as an integrated system. Threshold experiences aren't isolated from other elements. They're connected to liminality, communitas, movement intelligence, and all mDNA elements.

When we think holistically about movement, we see that threshold experiences are essential for movement multiplication. They're not optional or peripheral. They're central. Without threshold experiences, movements can't transform. Without threshold experiences, movements can't multiply. Without threshold experiences, movements become comfortable and sterile.

## Conclusion

Threshold experiences aren't about creating unsafe or dangerous environments. They're about creating in-between spaces that enable transformation. When threshold experiences are present, transformation happens and movements multiply. When they're absent, comfort prevails and movements maintain.

The path forward is clear: intentionally cross thresholds, create in-between spaces, strip away false securities, force dependence, and enable breakthrough. This isn't easy work, but it's essential work. The Western church has kept people in familiar spaces, and the solution isn't to work harder with familiar programs. The solution is to create threshold experiences that enable transformation.

The stakes are high. Threshold experiences enable transformation. Familiar spaces enable maintenance. Threshold experiences create disciples. Familiar spaces create consumers. The choice is ours: will we create threshold experiences that enable transformation, or will we continue with familiar spaces that limit our capacity?

The early church, historical movements, and contemporary examples all demonstrate that threshold experiences are achievable when we intentionally create in-between spaces. They show that threshold experiences aren't theoretical—they're practical and achievable. When we cross thresholds, create in-between spaces, and force dependence, transformation follows.

The question is whether we'll have the courage to create threshold experiences. Will we intentionally cross thresholds? Will we create in-between spaces? Will we strip away false securities? Will we force dependence on God and one another?

The future of the missional movement depends on threshold experiences. Without them, we maintain. With them, we transform. The choice is ours.
