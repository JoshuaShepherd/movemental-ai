What if mission isn't about going, but about being—incarnational presence? What if the most profound way God engaged the world was through incarnation, and we, his people, are called to follow in his footsteps? What if incarnational mission is not a strategy to implement but a way of life to embody?

**Incarnational mission** represents Jesus's pattern of embodied presence and contextual engagement. It is the way God chose to reach the world—not through programs or strategies, but through presence. The fact that the almighty God, Creator of all things, was present in the world for thirty years without anyone noticing is simply staggering. Most didn't quite get who they were dealing with until after the resurrection. How can the omnipotent God be so hidden that no one noticed he was in the neighborhood?

The incarnation provided believers with a wonderful and completely definitive understanding of God. N. T. Wright suggests that we must again and again look "into the human face of Jesus of Nazareth, until the awesome knowledge comes over us, wave upon terrifying wave, that we are looking into the human face of the living God." This gazing into the human face of the God-Man Jesus is absolutely critical for us to get a true understanding of what it means to be an incarnational disciple in the way of Jesus.

We are really excited about the fact that so many Christians are now engaged in aspects of the missional conversation; the church in our day is increasingly adopting a missiological understanding of itself, and individual Christians are also beginning to realize that every one of us is sent by Jesus into the world—in other words, that we are all missionaries. Mission is no longer merely relegated to a minority subcommittee with a view to overseas mission alone. All this is good, but in our opinion there is one more step required if we are going to become a truly untamed movement—we must embrace the full missional implications of the incarnation. If incarnation is the most profound way that God engaged the world, then we, his people, must follow in his footsteps—we must become incarnational. If missional defines our being sent out into the world, then incarnational must define the way in which we engage the world.

This framework connects directly to the core of missional impulse. Incarnational mission is the mDNA element that defines how we engage the world—not through attractional strategies or programmatic approaches, but through embodied presence and contextual engagement. It is the way Jesus engaged the world, and it is the way we are called to engage the world.

## The Framework Foundation: Incarnational Mission as Embodied Presence

Incarnational mission begins with a fundamental understanding of the incarnation itself. The incarnation of God in Jesus causes us to see the world in a different light—it changes our perspectives on God, discipleship, culture, and mission. Call it a missional mode, if you will. But unless we incarnate the gospel among the people we are seeking to reach, our message will fall on deaf ears. A church can display a sign out front, but unless its people incarnate the gospel in the community around them, their message will fall on deaf ears. We cannot demonstrate Christ in our values, beliefs, and practices as expressed in the church and spend the time and energy that was given to us to serve. We need to get close enough to people that our lives communicate everything.

Jesus's incarnation pattern provides the template for incarnational mission. Jesus was not merely some representative of God, a prophet, or an angel. He was God, 100 percent, fully present, in human flesh. If God is one of us, he knows our situation, our struggles, our yearnings, our temptations, our bodily functions and limitations, and so on from direct experience. It's hard to comprehend the meaning of this profound act of identification with us. At the very least it means he knows us, loves us, and has our very best interests at heart. We can trust him.

This embodied presence creates the foundation for incarnational mission. As God identified with us, so ought we identify with others. This will mean taking a given culture or people group seriously and deeply investing in them. We will need to take significant time to understand their history, their stories, their heroes, their books, and so on, in order to get their take on things. It is about immersing ourselves into their lives.

The contextual engagement dimension emerges from this embodied presence. Jesus didn't expect people to come to where he was, as we so often do, but rather went to them. He hung out in their social spaces, markets, and synagogues, and visited their homes. In other words, he came into direct proximity; he was near to them. Likewise, we need to reflect this in our own lives. Too many Christians "hang out" only with other Christians and in environments frequented by other Christians. If we are to follow Jesus, we need to make intentional choices to move out of our religious zones and be where the people are.

The missional-incarnational impulse finds its theological foundation in the incarnation itself—God entering our world, our culture, our neighborhood. This is not a strategy to implement but a reality to embody. It is the way God chose to reach the world, and it is the way we are called to reach the world. When we understand this, everything changes. Our approach to mission shifts from attractional to incarnational, from programmatic to presence-based, from event-driven to relationship-centered.

## Practical Application: The Six Practices of Incarnational Mission

How do we practice incarnational mission in our everyday lives? The practices of incarnational mission are not complicated, but they are costly. They require us to be present, get close, embrace powerlessness, recognize God's prevenient work, share in suffering, and proclaim the good news. These six practices—presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation—form the practical framework for incarnational mission.

### The Practice of Presence

This missional stance draws inspiration from the fact that God was fully present in the incarnation of Jesus. Jesus was not merely some representative of God, a prophet, or an angel. He was God, 100 percent, fully present, in human flesh. If God is one of us, he knows our situation, our struggles, our yearnings, our temptations, our bodily functions and limitations, and so on from direct experience. It's hard to comprehend the meaning of this profound act of identification with us. At the very least it means he knows us, loves us, and has our very best interests at heart. We can trust him.

We believe that an incarnational stance is an extremely important aspect of missional lifestyle. As God identified with us, so ought we identify with others. This will mean taking a given culture or people group seriously and deeply investing in them. We will need to take significant time to understand their history, their stories, their heroes, their books, and so on, in order to get their take on things. It is about immersing ourselves into their lives.

Lawrence and Louise Hirsch and family give us a great example of what it means to identify with a given culture. Following Paul's exhortation to reach the Jew first and then the Gentiles, they started a ministry in Melbourne, Australia, called Celebrate Messiah. It is an outreach to Jewish people and has had an incredible impact on the Jewish community in Melbourne. They have planted two churches so far and have seen hundreds of Jewish people come to know their Messiah. Beyond this, there is now evidence that Messianic Judaism is actually being considered to be a living part of the local Jewish life.

These Jewish believers see themselves as fulfilled Jews and continue on with many of their traditions. Of course, there are Gentiles present, but in order to identify with the Jewish people they have adopted many of the outward forms of the Jewish culture. This means that most congregants have Shabbat meals every Friday evening and celebrate Passover and all of the other feasts. Following Jewish customs, forms, and rituals, they meet for worship on Saturdays rather than Sunday. In spite of the fact that the wider Jewish community struggles to integrate them because of the historical anti-Semitism of the church, the members of Celebrate Messiah see themselves as part of the broader Jewish community in the city, and their impact is felt throughout.

This incarnational approach to mission is evident among many missionaries to Muslim contexts. For instance, we know of a group called Frontier Servants who, in order to identify with Muslim people, have for all intents and purposes actually become Muslims. Following Jesus (Isa in Arabic), they moved into the community, adopted the culture, customs, dress codes, and aspects of the religion where these did not conflict with explicit teaching of the Bible. One of them is now the official prison chaplain for Muslims in Melbourne prisons. This type of identification was particularly costly for the women, as they had to give up some of the basic freedoms Western women take for granted.

Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23 that he sought to become all things to all people in order to save some. Now, this might beg the question of how far we go in our attempt to identify and present the gospel in terms that people can understand. No doubt there are some limits. But if we are serious about identifying with a given people group, there is going to be a cost, whether that be in adopting a culture not our own or giving up personal freedoms. So be it.

But incarnational living need not necessarily be with another racial group. It can and must include the myriad subcultures in any Western city. It should also include various suburban settings, such as businesses, sports clubs, and so on.

### The Practice of Proximity

This practice is largely focused around issues of what we do about geographic setting and relational closeness. Once again it draws its inspiration from God's action in Jesus. God became a man not only in order to identify with us, but also to live with and among us! He was no recluse, keeping a safe distance; he literally immersed himself in people. Much of his time was spent just hanging out and getting to know the people around him. Jesus didn't expect people to come to where he was, as we so often do, but rather went to them. He hung out in their social spaces, markets, and synagogues, and visited their homes. In other words, he came into direct proximity; he was near to them.

Likewise, we need to reflect this in our own lives. Too many Christians "hang out" only with other Christians and in environments frequented by other Christians. If we are to follow Jesus, we need to make intentional choices to move out of our religious zones and be where the people are. It will require that we come into direct social contact with others and become a regular part of the natural rhythms of their community.

So, if we take the Incarnation seriously, we must take seriously the call to live incarnationally—right up close, near to those whom God desires to redeem. We cannot demonstrate Christ in our values, beliefs, and practices as expressed in the church and spend the time and energy that was given to us to serve. We need to get close enough to people that our lives communicate everything.

Where you stand determines what you see and do. A great example of this is set amidst the luxurious California beach city of Santa Barbara and involves the ministry of a friend of ours, Jeff, known as "the Jesus Man" because of the way he goes about his ministry. A few years ago, through much prayer, reading, and reflection, Jeff came to realize that he needed to leave the church and spend the time and energy that was given to him to serve the community around him.

Having seen what Jeff does firsthand, we are truly amazed what a shift in proximity can accomplish. In a few short years, Jeff has built relationships with people who would never have darkened the doorsteps of a church. He leads several groups of not-yet-Christians in cool bohemian pubs and housing developments, and the homeless in parks. One group has recently identified itself as a church and adopted the name Holy Chaos, which is appropriate given the wild lives of some of the people.

For our primary calling to more marginal groups, a commitment to proximity meant that we relocated to the local red-light and gay area of our city. On the one side of our house is a heroin rehab facility, and on the other the "working stroll" of some of the local street prostitutes. Across the road are boarding houses for semi-homeless people, many struggling with mental health issues, and a famous "drag queen" bar on the corner. Being located in this environment meant that we could not but see the world differently. Every time we went out our front door, we were reminded of a broken and lost humanity and the issues that confront the mission of the church.

Obviously this view is utterly different from that of a middle-class suburb. There are real needs in a middle-class suburb, but for many cultural reasons those needs are much more hidden and enclosed in privacy. People are very busy, so they don't tend to socialize much outside of a very narrow group of friends. The practice of proximity in the suburbs will mean that the disciple will need to be far more creative in getting beneath the surface, in actively building meaningful relationships and developing a context of trust in order to touch base with the needs of the people. We know of missional disciples who variously host regular street parties, train people in the art of recycling, run mother's groups outside of Christian circles, organize backyard blitzes, adopt and maintain local parks, provide chaplaincy wherever needed, and use myriad other ways to engage people in the burbs.

Whatever the context, followers of Jesus will need to make very intentional choices about where we position ourselves so that we can see and respond to the need around us. Being incarnational is about how we live out what it means to be little Jesuses in the community we are in. For each of us this will look and feel very different, as there are many aspects to being the hands, heart, and feet of Christ in a given context.

### The Practice of Powerlessness

While we can probably find many images in our culture of powerlessness, perhaps none is more obvious than that of a baby whose survival is totally dependent on others. Therefore, to think of Jesus as a dependent, vulnerable, and even needy baby is perhaps one of the most difficult things to grasp in God becoming man. Dan Russ rightly notes that when we reflect on the humanity of Jesus, our minds most easily leap to Jesus as a mature man. But Jesus didn't come to us as a grown man. In order to fully identify with us, he literally came into the world as we do, born as a dependent, vulnerable child.

The great challenge for us is to recognize that to be weak, needy, and even powerless is part of the human condition, not something to be abhorred. When we give up our sense of power and control, we can truly become human in a way that conforms to the image of Christ.

One of the most amazing things we can say about Jesus is that he is actually humble! The creator of all things is humble! We know this through what theologians call "his humiliation," powerfully described in Philippians 2. In Jesus, God does not come as an invading tyrant, but in the humblest of forms: the servant. This was not very "cool" in the Roman empire, as the slave was the lowest in the pecking order. This says a lot about God. But it ought to say a lot about us as well. "Every true follower of Christ must, through his own existence, try to express the same fact, that humility and self-denial are inseparable from the Christian life." So many of the sins of the historical church could have been avoided if we had simply understood this fact. There have been times when the last thing people would have called Christians is humble. We have been highly coercive, often unkind, and repeatedly judgmental.

When one applies this to our missionary calling in the world, it means that we come very humbly among a group of people. Like Jesus, we don't come into town wielding a sword or riding in like the cavalry. Nor do we come legislating people's morals or flouting celebrity, money, and ego. Rather, we come to subvert evil and brokenness through Christlike service. Following our humble Lord, we can never approach incarnational mission from an arrogant perspective. Missional disciples must not expect to conquer by power or by force; they must use the same means as Jesus: steadfastness in the truth, acceptance of being misunderstood and rejected, and a willingness to achieve victory through redemptive suffering. This is a dreadfully difficult lesson for us to learn.

### The Practice of Prevenience

The truth is that God doesn't limit his presence to baptized Christians—he is an unrelenting evangelist. He is always at work in his world—right in the thick of things—in sinful people's lives, including our own. Not all respond appropriately, but that doesn't seem to put our God off very much—he's persistent, he's insistent, and he's got a lot of mercy.

John Wesley called this reality "prevenient grace" (preparatory grace), and he built his entire ministry squarely on it! He really believed that God was always preparing the way for the preaching of the gospel, that he was at work in every person, wooing them into relationship in and through Jesus.

It is sound biblical doctrine. We don't "bring God" with us into any situation—he's there long before you or I arrive on the scene. We simply need to discern God's prevenient work in people's lives and join with him. All of us are living testaments to this truth.

We have since come to understand that many people have God-moments, or what are sometimes called "theophanies," in their lives. A theophany is some form of religious experience, a manifestation of God, that could be prompted, for instance, by watching a sunset: suddenly the wonder of it all dawns on a person—time seems to stand still and eternity fills the moment.

On other occasions, it could be in conversations—in a moment of in-breaking revelation, a significant truth dawns upon a person. This is what poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called an "inscape," and many people experience these at some time or another. As agents of Jesus, we can draw upon these experiences and give them their true meaning by directing people to the One who is the fulfillment of all human longing.

All disciples, regardless of our stories, are called in some way to practice prevenience—to somehow discern the traces and activity of God in people's lives and so join in the missio Dei, God's grand redemptive activity in his world. God is already doing this, and we can join him in the strange places of our cities. If we are not willing to follow our missionary God into such places, people on the edges of the church will likely never get to hear the gospel.

The kingdom of God is not limited just to the church, but extends over the entire cosmos; we, being commissioned agents of the King, can join with God in the redemption of the world, anywhere, anytime.

### The Practice of Passion

The fact is that humans suffer, and Christians who take seriously the lost and broken in our world will also suffer. This is the cost of discipleship; we are called to pick up our cross and follow Jesus. Implicit in the cross is suffering. In fact, Jesus clearly states that anyone who fails to pick up and carry the cross cannot be his disciple.

This has significant implications for discipleship and mission. As disciples we need to ensure we have incorporated a theology of redemptive suffering into our understanding of God, for this helps make sense of what we ourselves, or others, may experience. We also need to cultivate a sense of empathy or compassion for the other. This, in our minds, squares with how Jesus responded to others. He not only identified by experiencing the limitation that humanity brought, but he extended himself to feel what the other was feeling.

Identification on the level of the heart implies a certain intimacy with the people you are trying to reach. Identification, as we've said before, is understanding their stories, their heroes, their books, their take on things. To incarnate on the level of the heart means we begin to feel their stories, their lives, their pains. Our hearts and compassion are thereby activated.

If we are called to a particular people group or subculture, we need to understand the angst and pain the group may carry. A good example here is the Jewish community. It would be very hard indeed to launch a ministry to Jewish people without a basic knowledge of the Holocaust and a fairly solid appreciation of the pain that informs and motivates. The GLBT community is another case in point; it will be hard to understand where they are coming from both socially and politically without knowing something of their personal and collective stories and the pain and marginalization they have experienced from the broader society—particularly the church.

Incarnation of the heart can be costly, so we often avoid it. However, it is too easy for us to just engage our minds or even bodies for the cause and sake of the gospel. Engaging the heart completes the picture. Jesus didn't fulfill his mission on earth through mere forced obedience to the Father's wishes; his heart was engaged, and he was moved with compassion to act on behalf of a lost humanity.

Maybe we are a tad weird, but whenever we visit a city we try to walk the red-light district. We recently did this in Amsterdam, and we took some people with us. Many of them were missionaries to that city but had never visited this important, if not very dark, aspect of that city's culture.

Surely, loving a city requires that we feel its pain. The pain of the city can be a thermometer that connects us with the heart of God. To walk around and sense the lostness, despair, and longing can be difficult, but it is necessary if we are to make connections between God and the community.

Jesus puts himself in our situations because he loves us. "The people who sit in some black hole need no longer look upward to where a crack admits light and fresh air. They need only look down to the bottom of their abyss. There is Christ; there where the border runs between despair and disintegration. Therefore we can trust Him. And therefore it is no empty phrase that He is there for us and that He is our brother."

### The Practice of Proclamation

Jesus came to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, and there is no question that we are called to the same task. Aside from how we have individualized the proclamation—making it about personal salvation and narrowing the meaning of the gospel in the process—we have generally been quite good at this aspect of incarnational ministry. There is no doubt that the follower of Jesus must be both willing and able to share in the ministry of evangelism.

We are, in the end, messengers: it is an essential part of our purpose in the world to deliver the message. But we must do it in ways that are entirely consistent with the message; otherwise our lives will discredit the very message we seek to deliver. This is where personal witness and evangelism must be yoked together. Jesus is the Word. His life and teaching are one and the same. He is his own message—he is the good news.

Following the logic of the incarnation itself, our message is heard properly only when we have gone through the process of identifying with people, hearing them, understanding the issues they face, humbly living with them, and knowing how they experience and express their search for meaning. If we do this, we will have earned the right to address the hearts of the people and bring salvation to them. If we don't do this, we will simply impose a cultural Christianity on them, and they could well end up in a worse situation than before. This is what the Pharisees were guilty of in doing, and what we should be very wary of in our own lives as we seek to evangelize the lives of others. We therefore think that proclamation follows best after practicing the preceding "P's" of an incarnational lifestyle.

This is why discipleship plays such a crucial part in evangelism. Because discipleship is the process of increasingly becoming like Jesus, our lives will serve to legitimize what we say. Because we are appealing to people's deepest concerns, their existential issues known only to themselves and God, we stand on sacred ground; we must come into the relationship with personal integrity. When someone is not striving to be like his or her Lord and yet is calling others to give their lives over to God, it gives a very mixed message. It can even miscommunicate what God wants to do with people.

Now, we are not saying that we should be perfect before we can share the gospel, but surely we should be on the journey of being transformed ourselves before we call others to this arduous task. We do well to remember that evangelism is witness. Daniel T. Niles sums this up beautifully when he says the disciple "does not offer out of his own bounty. He has no bounty. He is simply a guest at his master's table, and, as evangelist, he calls others too." We believe that engaging our world incarnationally is not an option. If we genuinely seek to be like Jesus, then incarnational discipleship and mission should be the norm. It is the way God has chosen to reach the world in Jesus. It will require that we patiently love a person, a community, even a whole culture, to the point that we spend ourselves on being little Jesuses to that community. Not only is the credibility of the people of God linked to incarnational expression, but the credibility of the gospel is at stake in it as well.

The centrality of the community to the gospel means that the message is never disembodied. The word must always become flesh, embodied in the life of the called community. The gospel cannot be captured adequately in propositions, or creeds, or theological systems, as crucial as all of these exercises are. The gospel dwells in and shapes the people who are called to be its witness. The message is inextricably linked with its messengers.

Whatever our circumstance or context, understanding the implications of the incarnation and seeking to live them out will only make our lives more authentic, our love more tangible, and our light amidst the darkness shine more brightly.

## Case Studies: Incarnational Mission in Action

When we look at history, we see incarnational mission in action. Jesus's own incarnation provides the foundational example. The fact that the almighty God, Creator of all things, was present in the world for thirty years without anyone noticing is simply staggering. Most didn't quite get who they were dealing with until after the resurrection. How can the omnipotent God be so hidden that no one noticed he was in the neighborhood?

The early church demonstrates this incarnational pattern. They didn't build impressive buildings or create elaborate programs. They lived among the people, shared life with them, and embodied the gospel in their daily existence. They were present, close, humble, and they recognized God's prevenient work. They shared in suffering and proclaimed the good news. The pattern of incarnational mission is clear: presence leads to proximity, proximity leads to powerlessness, powerlessness leads to prevenience, prevenience leads to passion, and passion leads to proclamation.

The Celtic missionary movement provides a powerful historical example. Celtic missionaries didn't come as conquerors but as learners. They adopted the language, customs, and culture of the people they were seeking to reach. They lived among them, shared life with them, and embodied the gospel in their daily existence. They were present, close, humble, and they recognized God's prevenient work. This incarnational approach created one of the most transformative missionary movements in history.

Contemporary examples abound. We know of communities that have adopted incarnational mission as their core practice. Celebrate Messiah in Melbourne demonstrates incarnational presence among Jewish people. Frontier Servants demonstrate incarnational presence among Muslim people. These communities have chosen to identify with the people they are seeking to reach, adopting their culture, customs, and ways of life where these do not conflict with explicit biblical teaching.

The "Jesus Man" in Santa Barbara demonstrates what a shift in proximity can accomplish. By leaving the church and spending time and energy serving the community, he has built relationships with people who would never have darkened the doorsteps of a church. He leads several groups of not-yet-Christians in cool bohemian pubs and housing developments, and the homeless in parks. This is incarnational mission—choosing proximity to the broken, the marginalized, the lost, because that's where Jesus would be.

## Common Challenges to Incarnational Mission

The path of incarnational mission is not without obstacles. Contextual barriers represent perhaps the greatest challenge. We have tended to separate ourselves from the world, creating Christian ghettos where we only interact with other Christians. This separation makes incarnational mission impossible. We need to shift from separation to identification, from distance to proximity, from safety to presence.

The incarnational resistance comes from within ourselves. We are naturally drawn to safety, comfort, and predictability. The call to incarnational mission challenges these instincts. It requires us to be present, get close, embrace powerlessness, recognize God's prevenient work, share in suffering, and proclaim the good news. This resistance is not just external—it's internal. We resist incarnational mission because it costs us something. It requires sacrifice, identification, and presence.

The embodied transformation challenges our assumptions about what mission looks like. We have domesticated mission into programs, events, and activities. But incarnational mission is not a program—it's a way of life. It's not something we do—it's something we are. It's not about strategies—it's about presence. This transformation requires us to rethink everything we thought we knew about mission.

The mission practice challenges our assumptions about what success looks like. We have measured success by numbers, programs, and events. But incarnational mission measures success by presence, relationships, and transformation. This shift requires us to rethink our metrics and our methods.

## Integration: Incarnational Mission and the Movement Ecosystem

Incarnational mission does not exist in isolation. It connects to the broader ecosystem of missional movement. It is the way we engage the world, the pattern we follow, the practice we embody.

The connection to missional impulse is direct and essential. Incarnational mission is missional impulse in its embodied form. It refuses to be separated from presence, to be domesticated into programs, to be tamed by institutional safety. Missional impulse that is not incarnational is not truly missional—it's just another form of religious activity.

The connection to sentness reveals how incarnational mission flows from our identity as sent ones. We are sent by Jesus into the world, and incarnational mission defines how we engage the world. We don't just go—we are. We don't just do—we embody. We don't just proclaim—we presence.

The connection to contextual mission shows how incarnational mission adapts to different contexts. What incarnational mission looks like in a red-light district is different from what it looks like in a suburban neighborhood, but the pattern remains the same: presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

The connection to the broader mDNA framework is crucial. Incarnational mission is not just one element among many—it is the way we engage the world that activates all the other elements. When mission is incarnational, it multiplies. When it multiplies, it creates movement. When it creates movement, it transforms the world.

## Conclusion: Embodying the Incarnational Way

Incarnational mission is not a strategy to implement but a way of life to embody. It is Jesus's pattern of embodied presence and contextual engagement. It is the way God chose to reach the world, and it is the way we are called to reach the world.

The six practices of incarnational mission—presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation—provide the framework for this embodiment. They are not steps to complete but postures to embody. They create the incarnational dynamic that transforms individuals, communities, and movements.

The challenge before us is clear: will we embrace incarnational mission, or will we continue to settle for programmatic approaches? Will we be present, get close, embrace powerlessness, recognize God's prevenient work, share in suffering, and proclaim the good news? Will we follow the incarnational way of Jesus?

The question is whether we'll have the courage to step into the incarnational future that is coming. The question is whether we'll embody the presence of Jesus in our contexts. The question is whether we'll remember what it really means to follow the incarnational way of Jesus.

Together, we can embody incarnational mission. Together, we can be present, get close, and engage the world as Jesus did. Together, we can follow the incarnational way of Jesus. The incarnational way awaits us. Will we have the courage to follow?
