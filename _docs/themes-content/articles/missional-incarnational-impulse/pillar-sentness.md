What if we're all sent—apostles, not just pastors and teachers? What if being sent is not a special calling for a few but the normal calling for all? What if sentness is not something we do but something we are—the very nature of the church as a sent people?

**Sentness** represents the foundational understanding that we are sent by Jesus into every context. It is the recognition that every Christian is a sent one—a missionary in their context. This is not a special calling for a few but the normal calling for all. When Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you," he was speaking to all his disciples, not just a select few. We are all sent, and we are all missionaries in our contexts.

The challenge before us is clear: we have often reduced sentness to a special calling for missionaries, pastors, or church planters. We have created a false distinction between those who are "sent" and those who are not. We have domesticated sentness into a program, an event, or an activity. But sentness is not something we do—it's something we are. It's not a special calling—it's the normal calling for all followers of Jesus.

This framework connects directly to the core of missional impulse. Sentness is the foundation of missional impulse—the understanding that drives the church outward, the force that multiplies communities, the energy that transforms the world. It is not a program to implement but a reality to embody—the very nature of the church as a sent people.

## The Framework Foundation: Sentness as Apostolic Identity

Sentness begins with a fundamental understanding of the missio Dei—the mission of God. Mission is not something the church does; it is something God does, and the church participates in it. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people. This is not a secondary aspect of the church's identity—it is the church's identity.

When Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you," he was not only telling us where we are being sent, but also how we are to be sent. We are being sent here, but we are also being told how we are to be sent—incarnationally. Once again, as Christ-ian people, we are bound to follow in the way and pattern of Jesus. We are sent as Jesus was sent—into the world, into culture, into context, into relationship.

The apostolic understanding emerges from this foundational sentness. The word "apostle" comes from the Greek word "apostolos," which means "one who is sent." In the New Testament, apostles are not just the twelve—they are all who are sent by Jesus. Every Christian is an apostle in the sense that every Christian is sent. We are all sent ones, all apostles, all missionaries in our contexts.

This apostolic identity transforms how we see ourselves and our communities. We are not consumers of religious services but sent ones on mission. We are not attendees of church events but missionaries in our neighborhoods. We are not members of an institution but agents of the King in our contexts. We are sent, and this sentness defines who we are.

The missional foundation reveals how sentness flows from our identity in Christ. We are sent because Jesus was sent. We are missionaries because God is a missionary God. We are apostolic because the church is apostolic by nature. This is not something we choose—it's something we are. It's not something we do—it's something we embody.

The early church demonstrates this sentness in action. When Jesus commissioned his disciples, he didn't create a special class of missionaries—he sent all of them. When the early church spread throughout the Roman Empire, it wasn't because a few professional missionaries went out—it was because every Christian understood themselves as sent. Every believer was a missionary, every community was a sending community, every context was a mission field.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When persecution forced them underground, when all external structures were removed, they discovered the essence of sentness. Every believer was expected to be on mission. Every community was expected to multiply. Sentness was not optional—it was the core dynamic that multiplied the movement. They grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years, not through professional missionaries, but through every believer understanding themselves as sent.

## Practical Application: The Practices of Sentness

How do we practice sentness in our everyday lives? The practices of sentness are not complicated, but they are costly. They require us to understand that we are sent, to go out rather than expect them to come in, to multiply rather than maintain, and to activate apostolic intelligence throughout the community.

### The Practice of Understanding That We Are Sent

The first practice is understanding that we are sent. Every Christian is a sent one—a missionary in their context. This is not a special calling for a few but the normal calling for all. When Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you," he was speaking to all his disciples, not just a select few. We are all sent, and we are all missionaries in our contexts.

Understanding that we are sent requires identity transformation. We need to shift from seeing ourselves as consumers to seeing ourselves as sent ones. We need to shift from seeing ourselves as attendees to seeing ourselves as missionaries. We need to shift from seeing ourselves as members to seeing ourselves as agents of the King. This identity transformation is foundational to sentness.

Understanding that we are sent requires context awareness. We need to recognize that our context is our mission field. We need to see our neighborhoods, workplaces, and social spaces as places where we are sent. We need to understand that we are missionaries in our contexts, not just when we go somewhere else. This context awareness enables sentness.

Understanding that we are sent requires apostolic thinking. We need to think like sent ones, like missionaries, like apostles. We need to see opportunities for mission in our everyday contexts. We need to recognize that we are sent into relationships, into conversations, into moments. This apostolic thinking activates sentness.

Understanding that we are sent requires community support. We need communities that understand sentness, that support sentness, that activate sentness. We need communities that see every member as sent, that equip every member for mission, that release every member into their context. This community support sustains sentness.

### The Practice of Going Out Rather Than Expecting Them to Come In

The second practice is going out rather than expecting them to come in. Sentness is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. This shift requires us to move out of our religious zones and be where the people are. It requires us to engage culture where it is, not where we wish it was.

Going out means geographic movement. We need to be where the people are, not where we wish they were. We need to move out of our religious zones and be in the neighborhoods, workplaces, and social spaces of the people we're seeking to reach. We need to be present, be available, be accessible. This geographic movement enables sentness.

Going out means relational movement. We need to build relationships with people, create friendships, earn trust. We need to be part of their social networks, their communities, their lives. We need to share life with them, not just share information with them. This relational movement activates sentness.

Going out means cultural movement. We need to engage culture where it is, not where we wish it was. We need to understand the culture, adapt to the culture, become native to the culture. We need to speak the language, use the metaphors, connect to the stories. This cultural movement enables sentness.

Going out means missional movement. We need to scatter seeds, multiply disciples, plant communities. We need to go out into the world and multiply, not just maintain what we have. We need to create movement, not just sustain institutions. This missional movement activates sentness.

### The Practice of Multiplying Rather Than Maintaining

The third practice is multiplying rather than maintaining. Sentness creates multiplication, not just addition. We measure success not by how many people come to our events but by how many disciples are making disciples, how many communities are multiplying communities, how many movements are creating movements.

Multiplying means disciple multiplication. We need to make disciples who make disciples. We need to create cultures where disciple-making becomes the default mode of operation. We need to equip every disciple to make disciples, not just a few professionals. This disciple multiplication enables sentness.

Multiplying means community multiplication. We need to plant communities that plant communities. We need to create systems that enable multiplication, not just addition. We need to release people to multiply, not just maintain what we have. This community multiplication activates sentness.

Multiplying means movement multiplication. We need to create movements that create movements. We need to think in terms of exponential growth, not just linear growth. We need to trust the DNA to reproduce, not try to engineer the multiplication. This movement multiplication enables sentness.

Multiplying means apostolic multiplication. We need to activate apostolic intelligence throughout the community. We need to develop leaders who can extend, multiply, and architect. We need to create environments where apostolic intelligence can flourish. This apostolic multiplication activates sentness.

### The Practice of Activating Apostolic Intelligence

The fourth practice is activating apostolic intelligence throughout the community. Apostolic intelligence (AQ) is the form of organizational intelligence that enables the church to extend, multiply, and architect. It is the intelligence that drives sentness outward, creating the multiplication that characterizes genuine movements.

Activating apostolic intelligence means recognizing that all believers have apostolic capacity. We need to see that every Christian carries apostolic intelligence, that every believer can extend, multiply, and architect. We need to activate this intelligence throughout the community, not just in a few leaders. This recognition enables sentness.

Activating apostolic intelligence means developing apostolic leaders. We need to develop leaders who can extend the church into new contexts, multiply communities, and architect systems for movement. We need to create pathways for apostolic leadership development, not just pastoral leadership development. This development activates sentness.

Activating apostolic intelligence means creating apostolic environments. We need to create environments where apostolic intelligence can flourish, where sentness can be expressed, where multiplication can happen. We need to create structures that enable apostolic intelligence, not structures that suppress it. This environment enables sentness.

Activating apostolic intelligence means embedding apostolic culture. We need to embed sentness into the culture of our communities, the structures of our organizations, the systems of our movements. We need to create cultures where sentness is normal, where multiplication is expected, where apostolic intelligence is valued. This culture enables sentness.

## Case Studies: Sentness in Action

When we look at history, we see sentness in action. Jesus's own sending provides the foundational example. When Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you," he was not creating a special class of missionaries—he was sending all his disciples. Every disciple was sent, every disciple was a missionary, every disciple was an apostle in their context.

The early church demonstrates this sentness at scale. They didn't wait for people to come to them—they went out into the world. They scattered seeds, multiplied disciples, and planted communities. They grew from as few as 25,000 to up to 20,000,000 in just two centuries, not through professional missionaries, but through every believer understanding themselves as sent.

The Celtic missionary movement provides a powerful historical example. Celtic missionaries didn't wait for people to come to them—they went out into the world. They scattered seeds across Europe, planting communities that multiplied communities. They trusted the DNA to reproduce, and it did. This sentness created one of the most transformative missionary movements in history.

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates sentness at scale. Wesley didn't create a program—he started a movement. He didn't build an institution—he multiplied disciples. He scattered seeds, went out into the world, and multiplied. By the end of Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement had spread to America. What was the key? Sentness—every believer understanding themselves as sent.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When persecution forced them underground, they discovered the essence of sentness. Every believer was expected to be on mission. Every community was expected to multiply. Sentness was not optional—it was the core dynamic that multiplied the movement. They grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years, not through professional missionaries, but through every believer understanding themselves as sent.

Contemporary examples abound. We know of communities that have adopted sentness as their core dynamic. Every member is expected to be on mission. Every community is expected to multiply. Sentness is not optional—it is the core dynamic that multiplies the movement. These communities have seen exponential growth through sentness, not through attractional strategies.

## Common Challenges to Sentness

The path of sentness is not without obstacles. Sentness barriers represent perhaps the greatest challenge. We have tended to reduce sentness to a special calling for missionaries, pastors, or church planters. We have created a false distinction between those who are "sent" and those who are not. This reduction makes sentness impossible for most believers.

The institutional resistance comes from our tendency to create professional classes of missionaries. We have created systems where only some are sent, where only some are missionaries, where only some are apostolic. This institutionalization blocks sentness for most believers. We need to shift from professional missionaries to sent communities, from special calling to normal calling, from few sent to all sent.

The sentness transformation challenges our assumptions about what mission looks like. We have domesticated sentness into programs, events, and activities. But sentness is not a program—it's an identity. It's not something we do—it's something we are. It's not a special calling—it's the normal calling for all. This transformation requires us to rethink everything we thought we knew about mission.

The apostolic activation challenges our assumptions about what leadership looks like. We have often equated leadership with pastoral care, with teaching, with administration. But sentness requires apostolic leadership—leadership that extends, multiplies, and architects. This activation requires us to develop apostolic leaders, not just pastoral leaders.

The multiplication focus challenges our assumptions about what success looks like. We have measured success by addition—how many people come to our events. But sentness measures success by multiplication—how many disciples are making disciples, how many communities are multiplying communities, how many movements are creating movements. This focus requires us to rethink our metrics and our methods.

## Integration: Sentness and the Movement Ecosystem

Sentness does not exist in isolation. It connects to the broader ecosystem of missional movement. It is the foundation of missional impulse, the identity that drives the church outward, the force that multiplies communities.

The connection to missional impulse is direct and essential. Sentness is the foundation of missional impulse—the understanding that drives the church outward. We are sent, and this sentness creates the missional impulse that multiplies movements. Missional impulse that is not grounded in sentness is not truly missional—it's just another form of religious activity.

The connection to incarnational mission reveals how sentness defines how we engage the world. We are sent by Jesus into the world, and incarnational mission defines how we engage the world. We don't just go—we are. We don't just do—we embody. We don't just proclaim—we presence. Sentness and incarnational mission work together to create authentic engagement.

The connection to contextual mission shows how sentness adapts to different contexts. We are sent into every context, and contextual mission is the way we engage each context authentically. We don't just go anywhere—we go somewhere specific, and we engage that context deeply. Sentness and contextual mission work together to create authentic engagement.

The connection to the broader mDNA framework is crucial. Sentness is not just one element among many—it is the foundation that activates all the other elements. When sentness is activated, it multiplies. When it multiplies, it creates movement. When it creates movement, it transforms the world.

The connection to APEST reveals how sentness activates apostolic intelligence. Apostolic intelligence (AQ) is the form of organizational intelligence that enables the church to extend, multiply, and architect. It is the intelligence that drives sentness outward, creating the multiplication that characterizes genuine movements. Sentness and apostolic intelligence work together to create movement multiplication.

## Conclusion: Embracing Our Sentness

Sentness is not a program to implement but a reality to embody. It is the foundational understanding that we are sent by Jesus into every context. It is not a special calling for a few but the normal calling for all. We are all sent, and we are all missionaries in our contexts.

The four practices of sentness—understanding that we are sent, going out rather than expecting them to come in, multiplying rather than maintaining, and activating apostolic intelligence—provide the framework for this embodiment. They are not steps to complete but postures to embody. They create the sentness dynamic that transforms individuals, communities, and movements.

The challenge before us is clear: will we embrace sentness, or will we continue to reduce it to a special calling for a few? Will we understand that we are all sent, go out into the world, multiply rather than maintain, and activate apostolic intelligence? Will we follow the sentness way of Jesus?

The question is whether we'll have the courage to step into the sentness future that is coming. The question is whether we'll embrace our identity as sent ones. The question is whether we'll remember what it really means to be sent by Jesus into every context.

Together, we can embrace sentness. Together, we can understand that we are all sent, go out into the world, multiply rather than maintain, and activate apostolic intelligence. Together, we can follow the sentness way of Jesus. The sentness awaits us. Will we have the courage to embrace it?

### The Practice of Embedding Sentness into Organizational Culture

The sixth practice is embedding sentness into organizational culture. Sentness is not just an individual practice; it's an organizational reality. It needs to be embedded into the culture of our communities, the structures of our organizations, the systems of our movements.

This embedding requires intentional organizational change. It means assessing where sentness is strong and where it is blocked. It means creating pathways for sentness to be expressed. It means developing leaders who can activate and release sentness throughout the organization. It means creating structures that enable distributed mission rather than centralized control.

This practice requires us to rethink our organizational structures. We don't need structures that maintain the status quo; we need structures that release sentness. We don't need systems that control mission; we need systems that multiply mission. We don't need organizations that attract people; we need organizations that send people.

## Case Studies: Sentness in Action

When we look at history, we see sentness in action. Jesus's own ministry provides the foundational example. He was sent by the Father, and he sent his disciples. In John 20:21, he declares, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." This sentness created the multiplication that characterized the early church movement.

The early church demonstrates sentness at scale. They understood that they were sent ones, apostles in their contexts. They didn't wait for people to come to them; they went out into the world. They scattered seeds, went out into the world, and multiplied. They grew from as few as 25,000 to up to 20,000,000 in just two centuries, not through attractional strategies but through sentness.

The Celtic missionary movement provides a powerful historical example. Celtic missionaries didn't wait for people to come to them; they went out into the world. They understood that they were sent ones, and they lived as sent ones. They scattered seeds across Europe, planting communities that multiplied communities. They trusted the DNA to reproduce, and it did. This sentness created one of the most transformative missionary movements in history.

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates sentness at scale. Wesley didn't create a program—he started a movement. He didn't build an institution—he multiplied sent ones. He understood that every Methodist was a sent one, and he activated that sentness throughout the movement. By the end of Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement had spread to America. What was the key? Sentness—understanding that we are all sent ones.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When persecution forced them underground, they discovered the essence of sentness. Every believer was expected to be on mission. Every Christian was a sent one. Every disciple was an apostle. This sentness created the multiplication that grew the church from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years.

Contemporary examples abound. We know of communities that have adopted sentness as their core identity. They understand that every member is a sent one, that every disciple is an apostle, that every Christian is a missionary. They scatter seeds, go out into the world, and multiply. They trust the DNA to reproduce, and it does. They measure multiplication rather than addition, and they see exponential growth.

One community we know has embedded sentness into their organizational culture. Every member is expected to be on mission. Every disciple is expected to multiply. Sentness is not optional—it is the core identity that multiplies the movement. This community has seen exponential growth through sentness, not through attractional strategies.

## Common Challenges to Sentness

The path of sentness is not without obstacles. Identity barriers represent perhaps the greatest challenge. We have tended to see sentness as a special calling for a few rather than the normal identity for all. We have created a clergy-laity divide that separates "sent ones" from "regular Christians." This separation makes sentness impossible for most believers.

The sentness resistance comes from within ourselves. We are naturally drawn to safety, comfort, and predictability. The call to sentness challenges these instincts. It requires us to go out rather than expect them to come in, to scatter seeds rather than build fortresses, to multiply rather than maintain. This resistance is not just external—it's internal. We resist sentness because it costs us something. It requires sacrifice, risk, and multiplication.

The organizational transformation challenges our assumptions about what church looks like. We have domesticated sentness into programs, events, and activities. But sentness is not a program—it's an identity. It's not something we do—it's something we are. It's not about strategies—it's about being. This transformation requires us to rethink everything we thought we knew about church.

The mission practice challenges our assumptions about what success looks like. We have measured success by addition—how many people come to our events. But sentness measures success by multiplication—how many sent ones are multiplying sent ones, how many communities are multiplying communities, how many movements are creating movements. This shift requires us to rethink our metrics and our methods.

The identity shift challenges our ability to see ourselves as sent ones. We have been trained to see ourselves as consumers, attendees, and members. But sentness requires us to see ourselves as sent ones, apostles, and missionaries. This identity shift is not easy, but it is essential. When we understand that we are sent, everything changes.

## Integration: Sentness and the Movement Ecosystem

Sentness does not exist in isolation. It connects to the broader ecosystem of missional movement. It is the identity that activates apostolic intelligence, the reality that drives missional impulse, the truth that transforms our understanding of what it means to be the church.

The connection to apostolic intelligence is direct and essential. Sentness is the identity that activates apostolic intelligence. Apostolic intelligence (AQ) is the form of organizational intelligence that enables the church to extend, multiply, and architect. It is the intelligence that drives the missional impulse outward, creating the multiplication that characterizes genuine movements. When we understand that we are sent, we activate our apostolic intelligence.

The connection to missional impulse reveals how sentness drives the outward movement. Missional impulse is the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Sentness is the identity that creates this impulse. When we understand that we are sent, we are compelled to go out, to scatter seeds, to multiply. This sentness creates the missional impulse that multiplies movements.

The connection to incarnational mission shows how sentness defines how we engage the world. We are sent, and we are sent incarnationally. We don't just go—we are. We don't just do—we embody. We don't just proclaim—we presence. This sentness creates the incarnational mission that multiplies movements.

The connection to the broader mDNA framework is crucial. Sentness is not just one element among many—it is the identity that activates all the other elements. When we understand that we are sent, we activate our apostolic intelligence, we drive our missional impulse, we engage incarnationally, we multiply organically, we form communitas, and we reframe reality. This sentness creates the movement multiplication that transforms the world.

The connection to APEST reveals how sentness activates all five forms of intelligence. When we understand that we are sent, we activate our apostolic intelligence (extending, multiplying, architecting), our prophetic intelligence (challenging, calling, exposing), our evangelistic intelligence (gathering, proclaiming, connecting), our shepherding intelligence (caring, protecting, creating belonging), and our teaching intelligence (explaining, equipping, systematizing). This sentness creates the fivefold activation that multiplies movements.

## Conclusion: Living as Sent Ones

Sentness is not a strategy to implement but an identity to receive. It is the foundational understanding that we are sent by Jesus into every context. It is not something we do but something we are—the very nature of the church as a sent people.

The practices of sentness—understanding that we are sent, going out rather than expecting them to come in, scattering seeds rather than building fortresses, living as sent ones in every context, multiplying sent ones, and embedding sentness into organizational culture—provide the framework for this identity. They are not steps to complete but postures to embody. They create the sentness dynamic that transforms individuals, communities, and movements.

The challenge before us is clear: will we receive our identity as sent ones, or will we continue to see sentness as a special calling for a few? Will we go out rather than expect them to come in? Will we scatter seeds rather than build fortresses? Will we multiply sent ones who multiply sent ones?

The question is whether we'll have the courage to step into the sentness future that is coming. The question is whether we'll receive our identity as sent ones. The question is whether we'll remember what it really means to be sent by Jesus.

Together, we can live as sent ones. Together, we can go out, scatter seeds, and multiply. Together, we can follow the sentness way of Jesus. The sentness way awaits us. Will we have the courage to receive it?
