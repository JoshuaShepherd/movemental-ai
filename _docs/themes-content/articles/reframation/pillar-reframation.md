## Introduction

What if transformation starts with reframing—seeing God, people, and mission through re-enchanted frames? What if the key to movement multiplication isn't new programs or strategies, but new ways of seeing? What if the crisis we face isn't a lack of resources or passion, but a crisis of interpretation—the way we see and understand reality?

Most organizations today operate with reduced frames—narrow ways of seeing God, people, and mission that limit understanding and constrain engagement. These reduced frames work for maintenance and control, but they struggle with transformation and multiplication. They keep people in familiar ways of seeing, but they don't create disciples. They maintain the status quo, but they don't multiply movements.

**Reframation** represents a different approach—one that recognizes that transformation begins with reframing how we see God, people, and mission. Reframation is the urgent need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The term plays on "Reformation," suggesting that what we need is not merely reform but reframing—a fundamental shift in how we see and understand reality.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Reframation is element #6 of mDNA—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. When reframation is present, worldview transformation happens and movements multiply. When it's absent, reduced frames remain and movements maintain. When reframation is present, disciples see with new eyes. When it's absent, consumers see with old frames.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore reframation from multiple angles. We'll examine what reframation is and why worldview transformation enables multiplication, understand how to create reframation in your context, discover principles for maintaining reframed vision, learn from historical examples of reframation, address common challenges to reframing, and see how reframation integrates with other movement frameworks. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of how reframation functions as the foundation for worldview transformation and movement multiplication.

The stakes are high. The Western church has reduced the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God into narrow, propositional, rationalistic formulas. We have demythologized the biblical narrative, demystified our faith, and depoeticized our language. The result is a gospel that has lost its transformative power. The solution isn't to work harder with reduced frames. The solution is to recover reframation that enables worldview transformation.

## Framework Foundation: Understanding Reframation

### The Biblical Foundation

Reframation finds its foundation in the biblical narrative of worldview transformation through reframed vision. Throughout Scripture, we see reframing moments that create transformation.

Abraham experienced reframation when God called him to see beyond his current reality (Genesis 12:1). He reframed his understanding of land, people, and promise, seeing through God's eyes rather than his own limited vision. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

Moses experienced reframation at the burning bush (Exodus 3). He reframed his understanding of God, mission, and calling, seeing the holy in the ordinary, the divine in the mundane. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The prophets experienced reframation through visions that revealed God's perspective (Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1, Revelation 1). They reframed their understanding of reality, seeing through God's eyes rather than human limitations. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

Jesus experienced reframation throughout his ministry, reframing understanding of the kingdom, discipleship, and mission. He reframed the law, the temple, and the people of God, seeing through God's eyes rather than religious frames. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The early church experienced reframation through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), reframing understanding of God's people, mission, and the world. They reframed their vision of who God includes, how mission happens, and what the church is. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

These biblical examples reveal how reframation creates transformation: through seeing God, people, and mission through new frames, reframed vision that enables breakthrough, and worldview transformation that enables multiplication. Reframation isn't comfortable, but it's essential.

### Defining Reframation

**Reframation** is the urgent need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The term plays on "Reformation," suggesting that what we need is not merely reform but reframing—a fundamental shift in how we see and understand reality. Reframation addresses the "crisis of interpretation" where Christians struggle to recognize and respond to the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence.

Reframation has several key characteristics:

**Worldview Transformation**: Reframation involves worldview transformation—fundamental shifts in how we see and understand reality. It's not just adding new information but changing how we perceive.

**Re-enchantment**: Reframation involves re-enchantment—recovering wonder, mystery, and the sacred in the ordinary. It's seeing the world as enchanted, not disenchanted.

**Frame Shifting**: Reframation involves frame shifting—putting new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. It's changing the lens through which we see.

**Perspective Transformation**: Reframation involves perspective transformation—seeing from God's perspective rather than human limitations. It's seeing through God's eyes.

**Interpretive Renewal**: Reframation involves interpretive renewal—recovering the ability to interpret culture, people, and mission through re-enchanted frames. It's learning to see what God is already doing.

### The Reductionism Problem

The problem reframation addresses is reductionism—the way we have reduced the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God into narrow, propositional, rationalistic formulas. We have:

**Demythologized**: Removed the mythic power of the biblical narrative, reducing it to historical facts and propositional truths.

**Demystified**: Eliminated wonder and mystery from our faith, reducing God to manageable concepts and controllable ideas.

**Depoeticized**: Reduced poetic language to rational code, losing the power of metaphor, imagery, and story.

The result is a gospel that has lost its transformative power. It's like "tofu" rather than the jarring, transformative "Warhead" experience it should be. It maintains but doesn't transform. It informs but doesn't inspire. It explains but doesn't enchant.

### The Three Movements

Reframation involves three key movements:

**Remystifying**: Recovering wonder and radical amazement, recognizing that we are dealing with something far greater than ourselves. It means allowing ourselves to be astonished, amazed, and overwhelmed by the mystery of God. When we remystify, we recover the sense that God is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be encountered.

**Repoeticizing**: Using language that captures imagination and speaks to the heart, not just the mind. It means recovering the power of metaphor, imagery, and story. When we repoeticize, we recover language that can "steal past the watchful dragons" that guard human hearts, allowing truth to penetrate defenses that rational arguments cannot breach.

**Remythologizing**: Telling the full story of God with all its power and beauty, recovering the mythic elements that give the narrative its transformative power. When we remythologize, we recover the story that transforms, not just informs.

These three movements work together to reframe our vision, enabling us to see God, people, and mission through re-enchanted frames.

### The mDNA Connection

Reframation is element #6 of mDNA—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. Reframation works in relationship with all other mDNA elements, supporting and enabling their function.

When reframation is present, all mDNA elements can function properly. When it's absent, elements struggle to create transformation. The connection is clear: reframation enables mDNA to function as an integrated system.

### The Soft Eyes Approach

Reframation requires "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms, to see the whole picture rather than just analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see what is really there, to recognize the "shards of heaven's kaleidoscope" (the image of God) in every human soul, and to find what God is already doing in culture.

Soft eyes require:
- **Humility**: Recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is"
- **Childlikeness**: Approaching with wonder rather than cynicism
- **Openness**: Willingness to have our minds blown by the ever-greater God
- **Attention**: The art of paying attention, listening, and seeing

This soft eyes approach enables reframation because it creates the conditions for seeing anew, not just seeing more.

## Practical Application: Creating Reframation

### Principles for Reframation

Creating reframation requires several key principles:

**Recognize Reductions**: Identify how we've reduced God, story, and life to manageable, controllable dimensions. Awareness is the first step toward reframation.

**Explore Human Longings**: Understand the universal search for God, meaning, and transcendence. Recognize that people are "looking for the right things in the wrong places."

**Learn to See Anew**: Develop the art of seeing God, gospel, and culture with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary.

**Recover Wonder**: Remystify our faith, recovering wonder, mystery, and radical amazement.

**Recover Language**: Repoeticize our communication, recovering the power of metaphor, imagery, and story.

**Recover Story**: Remythologize our narrative, recovering the full story of God with all its power and beauty.

### Recognizing Reductions

The first step in reframation is recognizing reductions—identifying how we've reduced God, story, and life to manageable, controllable dimensions.

Recognizing reductions might include:
- **God Reduction**: How have we reduced God to manageable concepts? What have we lost in our understanding of God's mystery and wonder?

- **Story Reduction**: How have we reduced the biblical narrative to propositional truths? What have we lost in demythologizing, demystifying, and depoeticizing?

- **Life Reduction**: How have we reduced life to manageable dimensions? What have we lost in our disenchanted worldview?

- **Mission Reduction**: How have we reduced mission to programs and strategies? What have we lost in our reduced understanding of God's work in the world?

This recognition of reductions creates awareness that enables reframation.

### Exploring Human Longings

The second step in reframation is exploring human longings—understanding the universal search for God, meaning, and transcendence.

Exploring human longings might include:
- **Longing for Justice**: Recognizing the universal desire for justice and righteousness
- **Thirst for Spirituality**: Understanding the search for transcendence and spiritual experience
- **Hunger for Relationship**: Recognizing the need for authentic connection and belonging
- **Delight in Beauty**: Understanding the appreciation for beauty, art, and creativity
- **Need for Significance**: Recognizing the desire for meaning, purpose, and impact

This exploration of human longings enables reframation because it helps us see what people are really searching for, connecting their longings to the gospel.

### Learning to See Anew

The third step in reframation is learning to see anew—developing the art of seeing God, gospel, and culture with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary.

Learning to see anew might include:
- **Soft Eyes Practice**: Developing the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms
- **Detectives of Divinity**: Learning to read culture and people to discover their ultimate longings
- **Romancing the City**: Developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach
- **Interpathy**: Practicing deep cross-cultural empathy and understanding
- **Paying Attention**: The art of paying attention, listening, and seeing what God is already doing

This learning to see anew enables reframation because it creates the conditions for reframed vision.

### Remystifying Faith

Reframation requires remystifying faith—recovering wonder, mystery, and radical amazement.

Remystifying faith might include:
- **Recovering Wonder**: Allowing ourselves to be astonished, amazed, and overwhelmed by the mystery of God
- **Embracing Mystery**: Recognizing that God is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be encountered
- **Radical Amazement**: Recovering the sense that we are dealing with something far greater than ourselves
- **Sacred Recognition**: Seeing the sacred in the ordinary, the divine in the mundane
- **Childlike Wonder**: Approaching with wonder rather than cynicism

This remystifying faith enables reframation because it recovers the sense of wonder that enables transformation.

### Repoeticizing Language

Reframation requires repoeticizing language—using language that captures imagination and speaks to the heart.

Repoeticizing language might include:
- **Metaphor Recovery**: Recovering the power of metaphor, imagery, and story
- **Imaginative Language**: Using language that captures imagination, not just informs the mind
- **Heart Language**: Speaking to the heart, not just the head
- **Poetic Expression**: Recovering poetic speech that can "steal past the watchful dragons"
- **Story Language**: Using narrative and story rather than just propositional statements

This repoeticizing language enables reframation because it recovers the power of language that transforms, not just informs.

### Remythologizing Story

Reframation requires remythologizing story—telling the full story of God with all its power and beauty.

Remythologizing story might include:
- **Full Narrative**: Telling the complete story of God, not just selected parts
- **Mythic Power**: Recovering the mythic elements that give the narrative transformative power
- **Beauty Recovery**: Recovering the beauty and wonder of the biblical story
- **Transformative Story**: Telling the story that transforms, not just informs
- **Archetypal Patterns**: Recognizing the archetypal patterns that resonate with human experience

This remythologizing story enables reframation because it recovers the story that transforms, not just the facts that inform.

## Case Studies and Examples: Reframation in Action

### The Early Church

The early church demonstrates reframation through worldview transformation that created multiplication. The church experienced reframation through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), reframing understanding of God's people, mission, and the world. They reframed their vision of who God includes, how mission happens, and what the church is. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates reframation through cross-cultural engagement. When Peter engaged with Cornelius (Acts 10), he reframed his understanding of who God includes, breaking through religious frames to see God's heart. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates reframation through mission expansion. When the church scattered (Acts 8:1-4), they reframed their understanding of how mission happens, seeing mission as going rather than just coming. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates reframation through the gospel message. When Paul engaged with different cultures (Acts 17:16-34), he reframed how the gospel is communicated, adapting to different worldviews while maintaining core truth. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

### The Reformation

The Reformation demonstrates reframation through worldview transformation that created multiplication. The Reformers reframed understanding of authority, salvation, and the church, seeing through new frames that enabled transformation and multiplication.

The Reformation also demonstrates reframation through language recovery. When the Reformers translated Scripture into common language, they repoeticized the gospel, making it accessible and transformative. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

The Reformation also demonstrates reframation through story recovery. When the Reformers recovered the full biblical narrative, they remythologized the story, recovering its transformative power. This reframation created transformation and multiplication.

### Contemporary Movements

Contemporary movements like **Soma**, **3DM**, and others have intentionally created reframation. They've discovered that when reframation is present, worldview transformation happens and movements multiply.

Soma, for example, creates reframation through missional community engagement. Communities learn to see their neighborhoods with "soft eyes," recognizing what God is already doing. This reframation creates transformation and multiplication.

3DM structures their discipleship around reframation. Disciples learn to see God, people, and mission through re-enchanted frames, recovering wonder and mystery. This reframation creates transformation and multiplication.

These contemporary movements demonstrate that reframation is achievable when we intentionally create reframed vision. They show that reframation isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we recognize reductions, explore human longings, and learn to see anew, reframation happens and multiplication follows.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Reframation

### Reductionism

One of the greatest challenges to reframation is reductionism—the tendency to reduce the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God into narrow, propositional, rationalistic formulas. This reductionism prevents reframation because it keeps people in reduced frames.

Reductionism emerges from several factors: rationalistic culture, propositional theology, and disenchanted worldview. The result is frames that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to recognize reductions and intentionally remystify, repoeticize, and remythologize. Reframation requires recovering what has been reduced.

### Disenchanted Worldview

Another challenge to reframation is disenchanted worldview—the tendency to see the world as disenchanted, without mystery, wonder, or the sacred. This worldview prevents reframation because it eliminates the conditions for re-enchantment.

Disenchanted worldview emerges from several factors: scientific materialism, rationalistic thinking, and secular culture. The result is frames that are disenchanted and limited.

The solution is to recover enchantment—remystifying faith, recovering wonder, and seeing the sacred in the ordinary. Reframation requires re-enchantment.

### Propositional Thinking

Another challenge to reframation is propositional thinking—the tendency to reduce truth to propositions rather than stories, metaphors, and images. This thinking prevents reframation because it eliminates the power of poetic language.

Propositional thinking emerges from several factors: rationalistic theology, analytical culture, and propositional communication. The result is frames that inform but don't transform.

The solution is to repoeticize language—recovering metaphor, imagery, and story. Reframation requires poetic language that transforms.

### Cultural Disconnection

Another challenge to reframation is cultural disconnection—the inability to read culture, understand human longings, and connect the gospel meaningfully. This disconnection prevents reframation because it prevents seeing what God is already doing.

Cultural disconnection emerges from several factors: isolation from culture, lack of cultural understanding, and reduced mission understanding. The result is frames that don't connect with culture.

The solution is to learn to see culture with "soft eyes"—becoming detectives of divinity, romancing the city, and practicing interpathy. Reframation requires cultural connection.

### Comfort with Reduced Frames

Another challenge to reframation is comfort with reduced frames—the tendency to prefer familiar, reduced ways of seeing over reframed vision. This comfort prevents reframation because it resists change.

Comfort with reduced frames emerges from several factors: familiarity, control, and safety. The result is frames that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to embrace reframation as essential—recognizing that transformation requires reframing, that multiplication requires reframed vision, and that discipleship requires seeing anew.

## Integration: Reframation and Movement Frameworks

### Connection to mDNA

Reframation connects directly to the mDNA framework as element #6—the essential dynamic that enables movements to form and thrive. Reframation works in relationship with all other mDNA elements, supporting and enabling their function.

When reframation is present, all mDNA elements can function properly. When it's absent, elements struggle to create transformation. The connection is clear: reframation enables mDNA to function as an integrated system.

### Connection to Metanoia

Reframation also connects to metanoia—the paradigm shift that enables transformation. Reframation creates metanoia because reframed vision enables paradigm shifts that transform how we see and understand everything.

The connection is natural: reframation creates metanoia, and metanoia enables transformation. When we reframe our vision, we create the conditions for paradigm shifts that transform.

### Connection to Movement Intelligence

Reframation also connects to Movement Intelligence (MQ)—the framework for understanding movement quality and multiplication capacity. Reframation creates high movement intelligence by enabling worldview transformation, cultural connection, and multiplication.

The connection is essential: reframation creates movement intelligence, and movement intelligence enables multiplication. When reframation is present, movement intelligence increases and multiplication follows.

### Connection to Missional-Incarnational Impulse

Reframation also connects to Missional-Incarnational Impulse—the mDNA element that describes how movements engage missionally. Reframation enables missional engagement because reframed vision helps us see what God is already doing in culture.

The connection is natural: reframation enables missional engagement, and missional engagement enables multiplication. When we see with reframed vision, we can engage missionally and multiply.

### Holistic Movement Thinking

Reframation is part of holistic movement thinking—the recognition that all mDNA elements work together as an integrated system. Reframation isn't isolated from other elements. It's connected to metanoia, movement intelligence, missional-incarnational impulse, and all mDNA elements.

When we think holistically about movement, we see that reframation is essential for movement multiplication. It's not optional or peripheral. It's central. Without reframation, movements can't see clearly. Without reframation, movements can't engage missionally. Without reframation, movements become disenchanted and limited.

## Conclusion

Reframation isn't about changing the gospel. It's about changing how we see and communicate it. When reframation is present, worldview transformation happens and movements multiply. When it's absent, reduced frames remain and movements maintain.

The path forward is clear: recognize reductions, explore human longings, learn to see anew, remystify faith, repoeticize language, and remythologize story. This isn't easy work, but it's essential work. The Western church has reduced the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God, and the solution isn't to work harder with reduced frames. The solution is to recover reframation that enables worldview transformation.

The stakes are high. Reframation enables worldview transformation. Reduced frames enable maintenance. Reframation creates disciples who see with new eyes. Reduced frames create consumers who see with old frames. The choice is ours: will we create reframation that enables worldview transformation, or will we continue with reduced frames that limit our capacity?

The early church, historical movements, and contemporary examples all demonstrate that reframation is achievable when we intentionally create reframed vision. They show that reframation isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we recognize reductions, explore human longings, and learn to see anew, reframation happens and multiplication follows.

The question is whether we'll have the courage to reframe. Will we recognize reductions? Will we explore human longings? Will we learn to see anew? Will we remystify, repoeticize, and remythologize?

The future of the missional movement depends on reframation. Without it, we maintain. With it, we transform. The choice is ours.

**Next Steps**: Evaluate your current frames for reductionism. Are they reduced or reframed? Do they enable worldview transformation or maintain familiar ways of seeing? Recognize reductions, explore human longings, learn to see anew, and recover wonder, language, and story. Create reframation that enables transformation.
