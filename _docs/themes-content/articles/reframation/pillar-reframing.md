## Introduction

What if transformation happens through reframing—putting new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission? What if the key to movement multiplication isn't new information, but new frames that enable us to see differently? What if reframing is the practical process that makes worldview transformation possible?

Most organizations today operate with fixed frames—established ways of framing God, people, and mission that resist change and limit engagement. These fixed frames work for maintenance and stability, but they struggle with transformation and multiplication. They keep people in familiar ways of framing, but they don't create disciples. They maintain the status quo, but they don't multiply movements.

**Reframing** represents a different approach—one that recognizes that transformation happens when we put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. Reframing is the practical process of changing the lens through which we see, putting new frames around our understanding that enable transformation and multiplication.

This framework connects directly to the core of movement multiplication. Reframing is the practical expression of reframation—the mDNA element that enables movements to form and thrive. When reframing is present, reframation happens and movements multiply. When it's absent, fixed frames remain and movements maintain. When reframing is present, disciples see with new frames. When it's absent, consumers see with old frames.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore reframing from multiple angles. We'll examine what reframing is and why new frames enable transformation, understand how to create reframing in your context, discover principles for maintaining reframed vision, learn from historical examples of reframing, address common challenges to reframing, and see how reframing integrates with other movement frameworks. By the end, you'll have a complete picture of how reframing functions as the practical foundation for reframation and movement multiplication.

The stakes are high. The Western church has operated with fixed frames, creating ways of framing that maintain but don't transform. But the early church experienced reframing through the Holy Spirit, putting new frames around their understanding of God, people, and mission. This reframing created multiplication. The solution isn't to work harder with fixed frames. The solution is to create reframing that enables transformation.

## Framework Foundation: Understanding Reframing

### The Biblical Foundation

Reframing finds its foundation in the biblical narrative of putting new frames around understanding. Throughout Scripture, we see reframing moments that create transformation.

Abraham experienced reframing when God called him to see beyond his current frames (Genesis 12:1). God reframed his understanding of land, people, and promise, putting new frames around his vision. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

Moses experienced reframing at the burning bush (Exodus 3). God reframed his understanding of calling, mission, and God's presence, putting new frames around his vision. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

The prophets experienced reframing through visions that revealed new frames (Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1). God reframed their understanding of God, mission, and the world, putting new frames around their vision. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

Jesus' ministry created reframing—putting new frames around understanding of the kingdom, discipleship, and mission. He reframed the law, the temple, and the people of God, creating new frames that enabled multiplication.

The early church experienced reframing through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), putting new frames around their understanding of God's people, mission, and the world. They reframed their vision of who God includes, how mission happens, and what the church is. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

These biblical examples reveal how reframing creates transformation: through putting new frames around understanding, reframed vision that enables breakthrough, and new frames that enable movement. Reframing isn't comfortable, but it's essential.

### Defining Reframing

**Reframing** is the practical process of putting new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. It's changing the lens through which we see, putting new frames around our understanding that enable transformation and multiplication. Reframing is the practical expression of reframation.

Reframing has several key characteristics:

**Frame Changing**: Reframing involves frame changing—putting new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. It's changing the lens through which we see.

**Perspective Shift**: Reframing involves perspective shift—seeing from new perspectives that enable new understanding.

**Lens Changing**: Reframing involves lens changing—changing the lens through which we view reality, enabling new ways of seeing.

**Understanding Expansion**: Reframing involves understanding expansion—expanding our understanding beyond fixed frames to reframed vision.

**Practical Application**: Reframing involves practical application—bringing reframed vision into practice, not just theory.

### The Frame Principle

The core principle of reframing is: **The way we frame reality determines how we engage reality.** This principle recognizes that reframing is essential for authentic discipleship. The more we reframe, the more transformation happens. The more we maintain fixed frames, the more we maintain the status quo.

This principle applies across all dimensions:
- **God Frames**: Reframed God frames transform; fixed God frames maintain
- **People Frames**: Reframed people frames transform; fixed people frames maintain
- **Mission Frames**: Reframed mission frames multiply; fixed mission frames maintain
- **Church Frames**: Reframed church frames transform; fixed church frames maintain

The key insight is that reframing enables transformation. When we put new frames around our understanding, we create space for God to work, for growth to happen, for multiplication to occur. When we maintain fixed frames, we maintain the status quo.

### The Three Frame Areas

Reframing involves three key frame areas:

**God Frames**: Putting new frames around our pictures of God—recovering the full, unreduced, unleashed story of God. This involves remystifying, recovering wonder, and recognizing mystery.

**People Frames**: Putting new frames around our pictures of people—recognizing the image of God in every person, understanding human longings, and seeing what God is already doing. This involves soft eyes, detectives of divinity, and romancing the city.

**Mission Frames**: Putting new frames around our pictures of mission—seeing mission as going rather than coming, recognizing what God is already doing, and joining with God's work. This involves missional-incarnational impulse, contextual engagement, and sentness.

These three frame areas work together to reframe our vision, enabling us to see God, people, and mission through new frames.

### The Practical Process

Reframing follows a practical process:

**Recognition**: Recognizing current frames and their limitations. Awareness is the first step.

**Exploration**: Exploring new frames and possibilities. Don't limit yourself to familiar frames.

**Adoption**: Adopting new frames that enable transformation. Choose frames that expand understanding.

**Integration**: Integrating new frames into understanding and practice. Make the frames real.

**Maintenance**: Maintaining reframed frames against reversion. Protect the new frames.

This practical process enables reframing because it creates the conditions for frame changing that transforms.

## Practical Application: Creating Reframing

### Principles for Reframing

Creating reframing requires several key principles:

**Recognize Current Frames**: Identify current frames around God, people, and mission. Awareness enables reframing.

**Explore New Frames**: Explore new ways of framing God, people, and mission. Don't limit yourself to familiar frames.

**Adopt Reframed Frames**: Adopt new frames that enable transformation. Choose frames that expand understanding.

**Integrate Reframed Vision**: Integrate reframed frames into understanding and practice. Make the frames real.

**Maintain Reframed Frames**: Protect reframed frames against reversion to old frames. Maintain the new frames.

### Reframing God

Reframing God involves putting new frames around our pictures of God—recovering the full, unreduced, unleashed story of God.

Reframing God might include:
- **Remystifying**: Recovering wonder and mystery in our understanding of God
- **Recovering Story**: Recovering the full biblical story of God with all its power
- **Expanding Understanding**: Expanding understanding beyond reduced, limited frames
- **Recognizing Mystery**: Recognizing that God is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be encountered
- **Recovering Wonder**: Recovering radical amazement in our encounter with God

This reframing God enables transformation because it recovers the full story that transforms, not just the facts that inform.

### Reframing People

Reframing people involves putting new frames around our pictures of people—recognizing the image of God in every person, understanding human longings, and seeing what God is already doing.

Reframing people might include:
- **Soft Eyes**: Developing the ability to see the image of God in every person
- **Detectives of Divinity**: Learning to read people to discover their ultimate longings
- **Understanding Longings**: Understanding universal human desires and connecting them to the gospel
- **Romancing the City**: Developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach
- **Interpathy**: Practicing deep cross-cultural empathy and understanding

This reframing people enables transformation because it helps us see what people are really searching for, connecting their longings to the gospel.

### Reframing Mission

Reframing mission involves putting new frames around our pictures of mission—seeing mission as going rather than coming, recognizing what God is already doing, and joining with God's work.

Reframing mission might include:
- **Sentness Frame**: Seeing mission as going, not just coming
- **Incarnational Frame**: Seeing mission as entering, not just inviting
- **Contextual Frame**: Seeing mission as adapting, not just applying
- **Missional Frame**: Seeing mission as joining what God is already doing
- **Multiplication Frame**: Seeing mission as multiplying, not just maintaining

This reframing mission enables transformation because it creates frames that enable multiplication, not just maintenance.

### Integrating Reframed Frames

Reframing requires integrating reframed frames—bringing new frames into understanding and practice.

Integrating reframed frames might include:
- **Practice Alignment**: Aligning practices with reframed frames
- **Language Shift**: Shifting language to reflect reframed understanding
- **Structure Change**: Changing structures to support reframed frames
- **Culture Creation**: Creating culture that embodies reframed frames
- **Mission Engagement**: Engaging in mission that expresses reframed frames

This integrating reframed frames enables transformation because it makes the frames real and lasting.

### Maintaining Reframed Frames

Reframing requires maintaining reframed frames—protecting new frames against reversion to old frames.

Maintaining reframed frames might include:
- **Regular Renewal**: Regular renewal of reframed frames through practices and community
- **Frame Protection**: Protecting reframed frames against reversion
- **Community Support**: Being part of community that supports reframed frames
- **Reminders**: Creating reminders that help maintain reframed frames
- **Accountability**: Accountability that helps maintain the new frames

This maintaining reframed frames enables transformation because it keeps the new frames, not just creates them.

## Case Studies and Examples: Reframing in Action

### The Early Church

The early church demonstrates reframing through putting new frames around understanding that created multiplication. The church reframed their understanding of God's people through the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), putting new frames around who God includes. They reframed their understanding of mission through scattering (Acts 8:1-4), putting new frames around how mission happens. They reframed their understanding of the church through expansion (Acts 13:1-3), putting new frames around what the church is. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

The early church also demonstrates reframing through cross-cultural engagement. When Peter engaged with Cornelius (Acts 10), he reframed his understanding of who God includes, putting new frames around people and mission. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

### The Reformation

The Reformation demonstrates reframing through putting new frames around understanding that created multiplication. The Reformers reframed understanding of authority, putting new frames around Scripture and tradition. They reframed understanding of salvation, putting new frames around grace and faith. They reframed understanding of the church, putting new frames around the people of God. This reframing created transformation and multiplication.

### Contemporary Movements

Contemporary movements have intentionally created reframing. They've discovered that when reframing is present, reframation happens and movements multiply.

Some movements create reframing through missional engagement, putting new frames around mission and culture. Others create reframing through theological renewal, putting new frames around God and the gospel. Still others create reframing through community formation, putting new frames around church and discipleship.

These contemporary movements demonstrate that reframing is achievable when we intentionally put new frames around understanding. They show that reframing isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we recognize current frames, explore new frames, and adopt reframed frames, reframing happens and multiplication follows.

## Common Challenges: Obstacles to Reframing

### Fixed Frame Preference

One of the greatest challenges to reframing is fixed frame preference—the tendency to prefer familiar, fixed frames over reframed vision. This preference prevents reframing because it resists change.

Fixed frame preference emerges from several factors: familiarity, control, and safety. The result is frames that maintain but don't transform.

The solution is to embrace reframing as essential—recognizing that transformation requires new frames, that multiplication requires reframed vision, and that discipleship requires frame changing.

### Reductionism

Another challenge to reframing is reductionism—the tendency to reduce God, story, and life to manageable, controllable dimensions. This reductionism prevents reframing because it keeps frames reduced and limited.

Reductionism emerges from several factors: control preferences, safety focus, and disenchantment culture. The result is frames that are reduced and limited.

The solution is to recognize reductions and intentionally expand frames—exploring new frames, adopting reframed frames, and integrating transformation.

### Cultural Resistance

Another challenge to reframing is cultural resistance—the tendency of culture to resist frame changes and maintain familiar frames. This resistance prevents reframing because it creates pressure to maintain the status quo.

Cultural resistance emerges from several factors: institutional preferences, social pressure, and cultural assumptions. The result is frames that resist change.

The solution is to create counter-cultural communities that support reframing—communities that encourage frame changing, support reframed vision, and maintain new frames.

## Integration: Reframing and Movement Frameworks

### Connection to Reframation

Reframing connects directly to reframation—the mDNA element that enables worldview transformation. Reframing creates reframation because putting new frames around understanding enables worldview transformation that transforms how we see and understand reality.

When reframing is present, reframation happens. When it's absent, fixed frames remain. The connection is direct: reframing creates reframation, and reframation enables movement multiplication.

### Connection to Movement Intelligence

Reframing also connects to Movement Intelligence (MQ)—the framework for understanding movement quality and multiplication capacity. Reframing creates high movement intelligence by enabling reframed vision, cultural connection, and multiplication.

The connection is essential: reframing creates movement intelligence, and movement intelligence enables multiplication. When reframing is present, movement intelligence increases and multiplication follows.

### Holistic Movement Thinking

Reframing is part of holistic movement thinking—the recognition that all mDNA elements work together as an integrated system. Reframing isn't isolated from other elements. It's connected to reframation, movement intelligence, and all mDNA elements.

When we think holistically about movement, we see that reframing is essential for movement multiplication. It's not optional or peripheral. It's central. Without reframing, movements can't see clearly. Without reframing, movements can't engage missionally. Without reframing, movements become fixed and limited.

## Conclusion

Reframing isn't about changing the gospel. It's about putting new frames around how we see and communicate it. When reframing is present, reframation happens and movements multiply. When it's absent, fixed frames remain and movements maintain.

The path forward is clear: recognize current frames, explore new frames, adopt reframed frames, integrate reframed vision, and maintain reframed frames. This isn't easy work, but it's essential work. The Western church has operated with fixed frames, and the solution isn't to work harder with fixed frames. The solution is to create reframing that enables transformation.

The stakes are high. Reframing enables reframation. Fixed frames enable maintenance. Reframing creates disciples who see with new frames. Fixed frames create consumers who see with old frames. The choice is ours: will we create reframing that enables transformation, or will we continue with fixed frames that limit our capacity?

The early church, historical movements, and contemporary examples all demonstrate that reframing is achievable when we intentionally put new frames around understanding. They show that reframing isn't theoretical—it's practical and achievable. When we recognize current frames, explore new frames, and adopt reframed frames, reframing happens and multiplication follows.

The question is whether we'll have the courage to reframe. Will we recognize current frames? Will we explore new frames? Will we adopt reframed frames? Will we integrate reframed vision?

The future of the missional movement depends on reframing. Without it, we maintain. With it, we transform. The choice is ours.

**Next Steps**: Evaluate your current frames for fixed patterns. Are they reframed or fixed? Do they enable transformation or maintain familiar ways of framing? Recognize current frames, explore new frames, adopt reframed frames, and integrate reframed vision. Maintain reframed frames through regular renewal and community support.
