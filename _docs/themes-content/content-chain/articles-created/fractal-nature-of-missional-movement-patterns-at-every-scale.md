# The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement: Patterns at Every Scale

**Meta Description**: The same missional DNA that shapes a single disciple also shapes global movements. Discover how fractal patterns enable you to start where you are.

**Excerpt**: The word "fractal" comes from mathematics, describing geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. A coastline viewed from space shows the same jagged patterns you see when examining a single rock on the beach.

The fractal nature of missional movement reveals that the same missional DNA (mDNA) that shapes a single follower of Jesus also shapes entire movements that span continents and centuries. The six elements of mDNA—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas—each repeat at every scale.

In this article, we'll explore what the fractal nature means, why it matters for movement health, and how it enables us to start where we are. We'll discover how understanding fractals helps diagnose movement health and identify missing elements at any scale.

## Introduction

The word "fractal" comes from mathematics, describing geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. A coastline viewed from space shows the same jagged patterns you see when examining a single rock on the beach. The pattern repeats, whether you're looking from far away or up close.

The fractal nature of missional movement reveals something profound: the same missional DNA (mDNA) that shapes a single follower of Jesus also shapes entire movements that span continents and centuries. The six elements of mDNA—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas—each repeat at every scale.

This article explores what the fractal nature means, why it matters for movement health, and how it enables us to start where we are. We'll discover how understanding fractals helps diagnose movement health and identify missing elements at any scale. We'll also explore how the fractal nature means we can participate in the same movement dynamic that has shaped history, starting right where we are.

## What is the Fractal Nature?

The fractal nature of missional movement is the recognition that the same missional DNA (mDNA) patterns repeat at every scale, from the individual disciple to the global movement. Just as fractal patterns in mathematics repeat at different scales—the same pattern visible whether viewing from far away or up close—so the six elements of mDNA repeat at every level of missional movement.

> —*The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement*

The six elements—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas—must be present at every scale for movement to thrive. The same pattern that works at the individual level also works at the community level, the movement level, and the global level. This is not coincidence but design.

Understanding the fractal nature means we can start where we are. We don't need to wait for the perfect structure or the right opportunity. We can begin living the missional DNA at our current scale, and the same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally. When we align with the pattern, we participate in the same movement dynamic that has shaped history.

The fractal nature also provides diagnostic power. When a movement struggles, we can look for which mDNA elements are missing or weak at various scales. The pattern tells us what's needed. Health at one level requires health at all levels. The DNA must be present everywhere for the movement to thrive.

## Why the Fractal Nature Matters

The fractal nature matters because it means we can start where we are. We don't need to wait for the perfect structure or the right opportunity. We can begin living the missional DNA at our current scale, and the same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally.

> "Here is the promise of the fractal nature of missional movement: the same patterns that create movement at the global level also create movement at the local level."  
> —*The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement*

The fractal nature matters because it provides diagnostic power. When a movement struggles, we can look for which mDNA elements are missing or weak at various scales. The pattern tells us what's needed. Health at one level requires health at all levels. The DNA must be present everywhere for the movement to thrive.

The fractal nature matters because it reveals that the pattern is already present. We don't need to create the pattern—we align with it. The movement is already present in us. The DNA is already there. The pattern is already operating. Understanding this means we can participate in the movement dynamic that has shaped history, starting right where we are.

The fractal nature matters because it means our small acts of faithfulness become part of a larger pattern. When we understand this, everything changes. Our local experiments connect to global movement. Our individual faithfulness contributes to the whole. We participate in something larger than ourselves, not by waiting for the perfect opportunity, but by aligning with the pattern right where we are.

## How Fractals Work in Movement

Fractals work in movement by ensuring that the same mDNA elements operate at every scale. The six elements must be present at individual, community, movement, and global levels for the movement to thrive.

### The Six Elements at Every Scale

Each of the six mDNA elements repeats at every scale:

1. **Jesus is Lord**: At the individual level, Jesus is Lord of my life. At the community level, Jesus is Lord of our community. At the movement level, Jesus is Lord of the movement. At the global level, Jesus is Lord of all.

2. **Disciple Making**: At the individual level, I am being formed as a disciple. At the community level, we are making disciples together. At the movement level, the movement is a disciple-making system. At the global level, the global church is a disciple-making system.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: At the individual level, I am sent into my context. At the community level, we are sent into our neighborhood. At the movement level, the movement is sent into the culture. At the global level, the global church is sent into the world.

4. **Apostolic Environment (APEST)**: At the individual level, I express APEST gifting. At the community level, our community expresses all five functions. At the movement level, the movement operates with full APEST expression. At the global level, the global church operates with full APEST expression.

5. **Organic Systems**: At the individual level, I operate organically. At the community level, our community operates organically. At the movement level, the movement operates organically. At the global level, the global church operates organically.

6. **Liminality-Communitas**: At the individual level, I experience liminal spaces. At the community level, we experience communitas. At the movement level, the movement experiences liminality and communitas. At the global level, the global church experiences liminality and communitas.

### Pattern Alignment

The fractal nature means that when we align with the pattern at our current scale, we participate in the same movement dynamic that operates at larger scales. This is not about scaling up—it's about aligning with the pattern that already exists at every scale.

When we understand this, we can start where we are. We don't need to wait for the perfect structure or the right opportunity. We can begin living the missional DNA at our current scale, and the same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally.

## Common Misunderstandings

Several misunderstandings about the fractal nature prevent us from experiencing its transformative power.

**Misunderstanding 1: Fractals are just theory**

The fractal nature is not just theory—it's a practical reality. The same patterns that create movement at the global level also create movement at the local level. When we align with the pattern at our current scale, we participate in the same movement dynamic that operates at larger scales.

**Misunderstanding 2: Fractals only apply to large movements**

The fractal nature applies at every scale, from the individual disciple to the global movement. The pattern works at any scale. We don't need to be part of a large movement to experience the fractal nature—we can start where we are, with what we have, aligned with the pattern.

**Misunderstanding 3: Fractals are coincidental**

The fractal nature is not coincidental—it's by design. The same design principles operate at every level. This is not accident but intention. The pattern is already present, and we align with it, not create it.

**Misunderstanding 4: We need to create the pattern**

We don't need to create the pattern—it's already there. The movement is already present in us. The DNA is already there. The pattern is already operating. Our job is to align with it, not invent it.

## Living the Fractal Pattern

Living the fractal pattern involves starting where we are, aligning with the pattern, and participating in the movement dynamic. Here are key practices for living the fractal pattern:

### 1. Start Where You Are

Don't wait for the perfect structure or the right opportunity. Begin living the missional DNA at your current scale. The same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally. Start with what you have, where you are, aligned with the pattern.

### 2. Align with the Pattern

The pattern is already present—align with it. Assess your current expression against the six mDNA elements. Identify which elements are present, which are missing, and which are weak. Then work to align with the full pattern at your current scale.

### 3. Participate in the Movement

When we align with the pattern, we participate in the same movement dynamic that has shaped history. Our small acts of faithfulness become part of a larger pattern. Our local experiments connect to global movement. Our individual faithfulness contributes to the whole.

### 4. Diagnose Movement Health

Use the fractal nature to diagnose movement health. When a movement struggles, look for which mDNA elements are missing or weak at various scales. The pattern tells us what's needed. Health at one level requires health at all levels.

### 5. Recognize the Pattern Everywhere

The fractal nature means the pattern is visible everywhere. Look for it in your own life, in your community, in movements you're part of, and in the global church. The same pattern operates at every scale. Recognizing it helps us understand how to participate in the movement dynamic.
