## Introduction

The apostolic environment is the foundational field created by the apostolic function that gives birth to all other ministries in the Body of Christ. This concept is central to understanding how the church is designed to function according to its constitutional framework in Ephesians 4:1-16. Yet it is often misunderstood, reduced to hierarchical leadership, or dismissed as irrelevant for contemporary churches.

This FAQ addresses the most common questions about the apostolic environment, APEST ministries, and how they work together to create missional movement. These questions arise naturally from the master document and address both theological foundations and practical implications. Each answer is drawn from Alan's corpus and written in his voice to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

Whether you are exploring this concept for the first time or seeking to deepen your understanding, these questions and answers will help you grasp the comprehensive nature of the apostolic environment and its essential role in the church's God-intended design.

## Questions

### Q1: What is the apostolic environment, and why does it matter?

**Answer**: The apostolic environment is the foundational field created by the apostolic function that gives birth to all other ministries in the Body of Christ. It is not simply a leadership style or organizational structure, but the theo-genetic foundation that hosts the DNA of Jesus' church. This environment is the space where the full expression of APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) ministries can emerge, flourish, and produce the fruit they are intended to produce.

The apostolic environment matters because it is the constitutional design of the church as revealed in Ephesians 4:1-16. When churches operate without the apostolic environment, they cannot achieve the maturity and fullness in Christ that is their God-intended destiny. Without it, churches typically operate with reduced ministry paradigms (just shepherd and teacher), creating systemic deficiencies that prevent the church from reaching its full potential.

The apostolic environment enables translocal, networked movements rather than isolated institutions. It creates the conditions for multiplication, theological integrity, and missional effectiveness. Every significant Jesus movement in history has been catalyzed by apostolic ministry, and conversely, the omission of apostolic function from the ministry mix has been detrimental to the health and mission of the church.

**Key Points**:
- The apostolic environment is the foundational field that enables all APEST ministries to flourish
- It is the constitutional design of the church, not optional
- Without it, churches operate with reduced paradigms and cannot reach maturity
- It enables networked movements rather than isolated institutions

**Examples**:
- The early church operated with a full APEST expression, creating a translocal movement
- The organic church movement starts 2-4 new churches daily because of the apostolic environment
- Many Wesleyan denominations declined after suppressing parts of APEST

### Q2: Why is the apostolic listed first in ministry lists? Does this create a hierarchy?

**Answer**: The apostolic is listed first in all New Testament ministry lists (1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11) not because of hierarchy but because of foundational function. The apostolic creates the environment that enables other ministries to emerge, but it does not control or dominate them. The leadership dynamic is that of a servant-inspirer model, not one who "lords it over others."

The primacy of the apostolic is about foundational function, not positional authority. Just as a foundation is essential for a building but doesn't control what happens in the rooms above, the apostolic creates the environment but doesn't dictate how other ministries function. The apostolic function operates through inspirational authority based on vision, meaning, and purpose—not transactional authority based on position or power.

This is why Paul says the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets" (Ephesians 2:20). The foundation is essential, but it serves the whole structure. The apostolic environment enables the prophetic, which enables the evangelistic, which enables the shepherding, which enables the teaching. Each function creates the environment for the next, creating a cascading effect of ministry activation.

**Key Points**:
- The apostolic is foundational, not hierarchical
- It creates the environment but doesn't control other ministries
- Leadership operates through inspirational authority, not positional power
- Each function enables the next in a cascading effect

**Examples**:
- The early church's apostolic leadership created space for prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers to flourish
- John Wesley's apostolic function enabled all five ministries to operate in the Methodist movement

### Q3: Do we need an apostle to have an apostolic environment?

**Answer**: While apostolic people are helpful, the apostolic environment can be created through practices, structures, and culture that activate apostolic function throughout the community. It's about creating the conditions, not waiting for the perfect leader. The environment is created by the activation of apostolic function, which can happen through various means: practices that extend mission, structures that guard DNA, networks that create translocal connections, and cultures that enable all ministries to flourish.

The apostolic environment is not dependent on having one person who embodies the full apostolic function. Instead, it can be created through:
- Practices that extend mission and plant the gospel in new contexts
- Structures that guard theological integrity and maintain the DNA
- Networks that create translocal connections and shared purpose
- Cultures that welcome and activate all five APEST functions

Even in churches without a recognized apostle, the apostolic environment can be created by intentionally activating apostolic function through the community. This might mean creating space for pioneering mission, establishing practices that guard the gospel, building networks with other missional communities, and developing cultures that enable all ministries to emerge.

**Key Points**:
- The apostolic environment can be created without a single apostolic person
- It's about creating conditions through practices, structures, and culture
- Apostolic function can be activated throughout the community
- The goal is creating the environment, not finding the perfect leader

**Examples**:
- Small churches can create apostolic environments through practices and culture
- Networks can create apostolic environments through shared mission and purpose
- Communities can activate apostolic function collectively

### Q4: What are the four critical functions of apostolic ministry?

**Answer**: The apostolic function operates through four critical functions that create the apostolic environment:

1. **Pioneering/Seeding**: This is the external drive that extends the mission of the church by planting the gospel in new territories and cultures. The apostolic function embeds the DNA of Jesus' church in fresh contexts, creating new expressions of ecclesia that are faithful to the gospel while adapted to local culture.

2. **Guarding/Custodianship**: This is the internal impulse that maintains the theological integrity of the movement by guarding against mutations in the primary codes. The apostolic function ensures the gospel, ecclesiology, Christology, and eschatology remain pure, addressing any theological issues that threaten the integrity of the movement.

3. **Networked Movement**: This function cultivates translocal, fully networked movements through vision, purpose, and the management of meaning. The apostolic creates a web of relationships held together by shared identity and destiny, enabling movements to maintain unity while spreading across diverse contexts.

4. **Creating Environment for Other Ministries**: This is perhaps the most distinctive function—the apostolic creates the field in which the prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries can emerge and function effectively. The apostolic environment enables all five functions to work together synergistically.

These four functions work together to create the apostolic environment. The pioneering function extends mission, the guarding function maintains integrity, the networking function creates movement, and the environmental function enables all ministries to flourish.

**Key Points**:
- Four functions: pioneering/seeding, guarding/custodianship, networked movement, creating environment
- Each function serves a distinct purpose in creating the apostolic environment
- They work together synergistically
- The environmental function is distinctive and essential

**Examples**:
- Paul's ministry demonstrates all four functions: pioneering (planting churches), guarding (addressing heresy), networking (connecting churches), creating environment (enabling other ministries)
- Contemporary movements like NCMI demonstrate all four functions operating together

### Q5: What is the difference between Pauline and Petrine apostolic ministry?

**Answer**: The distinction between Pauline and Petrine apostolic ministry helps us understand different expressions of the apostolic environment:

**Pauline Model (Cross-Cultural Pioneer Founder)**: Called to extend and establish Christianity onto new ground. More translocal, itinerant, entrepreneurial. Thrives in wide-open frontiers. Examples include Hudson Taylor, Roland Allen, Neil Cole, and Dave Ferguson. Pauline apostles are natural entrepreneurs, constantly scanning their context for new opportunities. They likely resist tighter, more bureaucratic constraints and thrive in environments that allow for risk and adventure.

**Petrine Model (Intracultural Visionary Architect)**: Called to reframe the identity and mission of existing churches. More internally focused, less cross-cultural, intrapreneurial. Works within existing contexts to mobilize for mission. Examples include Alan Hirsch, Mike Breen, Reggie McNeal, and Tim Keller. Petrine apostles tend to have a greater tolerance for more traditional contexts and flourish in reframing and reinterpreting existing institutions.

Both models share core functions (custodian, guardian, networker, translocal activity) but differ in focus and approach. The Pauline extends mission; the Petrine remissionalizes the church. The Pauline is more like an entrepreneur; the Petrine is more like an intrapreneur—someone within an organization who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a viable outcome through assertive risk-taking and innovation.

**Key Points**:
- Pauline: extends mission to new ground, cross-cultural, entrepreneurial
- Petrine: remissionalizes existing churches, intracultural, intrapreneurial
- Both share core functions but differ in focus and approach
- Both are needed in the church

**Examples**:
- Patrick of Ireland: classic Pauline apostle
- John Wesley: mixture of both, with Petrine leanings in later ministry
- Contemporary examples demonstrate both models

### Q6: What is "Sense" and how does it relate to the apostolic environment?

**Answer**: "Sense" is Alan's term for the ever-present, primordial template of APEST that seeks expression in every church throughout history. Even when suppressed or unrecognized, Sense exerts pressure on the church to conform to Jesus' original design. This explains why churches often struggle with identity when operating with reduced ministry paradigms, why revival movements typically rediscover apostolic and prophetic functions, and why healthy churches naturally develop all five APEST functions even without using that language.

Sense is not human invention but divine design—the ongoing fruit of Christ's ascension gifts to his church. It is the constitutional template that Ephesians 4:1-16 establishes, and it seeks expression in every church regardless of whether that church recognizes it or not. The apostolic environment is the space where Sense finds expression—where the ever-present template becomes reality.

When churches operate with reduced paradigms (typically just shepherd and teacher), Sense exerts pressure to restore the missing functions. This is why movements that suppress APEST eventually decline, and why movements that recover APEST experience renewal. Sense is always present, secretly exerting its pressure to conform our expressions of church to the one that Jesus intended in the first place.

**Key Points**:
- Sense is the ever-present APEST template seeking expression
- It exerts pressure even when suppressed
- It explains why movements recover APEST functions
- The apostolic environment is where Sense finds expression

**Examples**:
- Revival movements typically rediscover apostolic and prophetic functions
- Healthy churches naturally develop all five functions even without APEST language
- Movements that suppress APEST eventually decline

### Q7: How does the apostolic environment relate to Ephesians 4:1-16?

**Answer**: Ephesians 4:1-16 is the constitutional document of the church, and the apostolic environment is the space where this constitutional framework finds expression. Like a national constitution, this passage establishes foundational principles (unity in diversity), defines organizational structure (APEST ministries), outlines ultimate purposes (maturity and fullness in Christ), and provides ongoing guidance for all subsequent church life and ministry.

The passage reveals three natural sections: (1) Foundations for unity (vv. 1-6), (2) The ascension gifting of APEST (vv. 7-11), and (3) Attaining maturity and fullness (vv. 12-16). The Greek verb for "given" (edothe) signals a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects. All five APEST ministries are bound together under the ruling verb—none may be omitted without violating the grammar and logic of the text.

The apostolic environment is the space where this constitutional framework becomes reality. It is where the ascension gifts are activated, where unity is maintained through diversity, and where the church moves toward maturity. When churches ignore or reduce this constitutional framework, they operate outside their God-given design. The apostolic environment restores the church to its constitutional design.

**Key Points**:
- Ephesians 4:1-16 is the constitutional document of the church
- The apostolic environment is where this framework finds expression
- All five APEST ministries are necessary and bound together
- The goal is maturity and fullness in Christ

**Examples**:
- Churches that operate with reduced paradigms cannot achieve maturity
- Movements that recover APEST experience renewal and multiplication

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

### Q8: Can a church have an apostolic environment if it's not planting churches?

**Answer**: Yes, absolutely. While church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, the apostolic environment is much broader. It includes the pioneering impulse that extends mission, but it also includes the custodial function that guards theological integrity, the networking function that creates translocal movements, and the environmental function that enables all ministries to flourish.

The apostolic environment is about creating the conditions for missional movement, not just starting new churches. A church can create an apostolic environment by:
- Extending mission into new contexts (neighborhoods, workplaces, communities)
- Guarding theological integrity and maintaining the gospel DNA
- Building networks with other missional communities
- Creating cultures that enable all five APEST functions to flourish

Even a church that never plants a new church can create an apostolic environment by activating apostolic function in these ways. The key is not whether you're planting churches, but whether you're creating the conditions for missional movement and enabling all five ministries to flourish.

**Key Points**:
- Church planting is one expression, but not the only one
- The apostolic environment is about creating conditions for missional movement
- Apostolic function can be activated in various ways
- The goal is enabling all five ministries to flourish

**Examples**:
- Churches can extend mission into neighborhoods and workplaces
- Churches can guard DNA and build networks without planting churches
- The apostolic environment enables movement, not just multiplication

### Q9: How do we know if we're operating in an apostolic environment?

**Answer**: There are several indicators that a church is operating in an apostolic environment:

1. **Multiplication happening**: New expressions of church, new missional initiatives, new disciples making disciples
2. **Translocal connections**: Networks with other missional communities, shared mission and purpose beyond local boundaries
3. **Theological integrity maintained**: The gospel and ecclesial DNA are guarded and protected
4. **All five functions contributing**: Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, and Teacher are all active and valued
5. **Movemental momentum**: The church feels like a movement rather than an institution
6. **Maturity developing**: People are growing toward "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ"
7. **Missional effectiveness**: The church is extending mission and making disciples effectively

Conversely, churches operating without the apostolic environment typically show:
- Reduced ministry paradigms (just shepherd and teacher)
- Institutional maintenance rather than missional movement
- Lack of multiplication or extension
- Theological drift or confusion
- Immaturity and dependency
- Isolation from other missional communities

The apostolic environment creates a different "feel"—there's a sense of movement, multiplication, theological clarity, and missional effectiveness. People are being equipped for works of service, and the church is moving toward maturity.

**Key Points**:
- Indicators include multiplication, translocal connections, theological integrity, full APEST expression
- Movemental momentum and maturity are key signs
- Without it, churches show reduced paradigms and institutional maintenance
- The "feel" is different—movement rather than institution

**Examples**:
- The early church demonstrated all indicators
- Contemporary movements like organic church and NCMI show these indicators
- Churches that recover APEST experience these changes

### Q10: Does APEST replace our current ministry structures?

**Answer**: No. APEST does not replace existing structures but expands and enriches them. The goal is restoration—bringing the full spectrum of Christ's ascension gifts back into the life of the church. Churches can maintain their current structures while activating dormant APEST functions.

The problem is not that existing structures are bad, but that operating with only shepherd and teacher functions creates an imbalanced system. APEST expands the ministry ecosystem to include all five functions, creating a richer, more complete expression of Christ's ministry through his people.

This is about addition, not subtraction. Churches can keep their current programs, staff structures, and organizational models while also activating apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions. The goal is fullness, not replacement. The apostolic environment enables all five functions to work together, enriching rather than replacing what already exists.

**Key Points**:
- APEST expands and enriches, doesn't replace
- The goal is restoration, not replacement
- Churches can maintain current structures while activating APEST
- This is about addition, not subtraction

**Examples**:
- Churches can keep existing programs while adding APEST functions
- The goal is fullness, not replacement of what works
- APEST enriches rather than replaces

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 2; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

### Q11: How do we activate APEST if we don't have all five functions present?

**Answer**: Start by identifying what is present and what is missing. Create space for missing functions to emerge. Sometimes functions are present but suppressed. Sometimes they need to be developed. The goal is to move toward full expression, not achieve it immediately.

Practical steps include:
1. **Assess current expression**: What APEST functions are active? Which are missing or suppressed?
2. **Create space for missing functions**: Intentionally make room for apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions to emerge
3. **Develop existing functions**: Strengthen what's already present while developing what's missing
4. **Build APEST teams**: Create leadership teams that represent the full APEST spectrum
5. **Train and equip**: Provide resources and training for people to discover and develop their APEST callings
6. **Celebrate diversity**: Value all five functions equally, not just shepherd and teacher

The apostolic environment can be created even when not all functions are fully developed. Start where you are, identify what's missing, and intentionally create space for those functions to emerge. The goal is movement toward fullness, not immediate perfection.

**Key Points**:
- Start by assessing what's present and what's missing
- Create space for missing functions to emerge
- Develop existing functions while building missing ones
- The goal is movement toward fullness, not immediate perfection

**Examples**:
- Small churches can activate APEST through practices and culture
- Networks can create APEST teams across multiple churches
- The goal is progress, not perfection

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Organic Systems

### Q12: What happens when churches operate without the apostolic environment?

**Answer**: When churches operate without the apostolic environment, they experience several negative consequences:

1. **Reduced ministry paradigms**: Churches typically operate with only shepherd and teacher functions, creating a care-and-instruction model that lacks missional dynamism.

2. **Institutional dysfunction**: Without apostolic multiplication, churches stop at evangelistic addition. Without apostolic action, churches fail to experience the promised presence of Christ. Without apostolic clarity, identity and purpose become murky.

3. **Spiritual immaturity**: The church cannot reach "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13) when operating with reduced ministry paradigms. The missing apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions create systemic deficiencies.

4. **Mission ineffectiveness**: Without the apostolic environment, churches struggle to extend mission, adapt to new contexts, and create translocal movements. They become isolated institutions rather than networked movements.

5. **Loss of movemental capacity**: Every significant Jesus movement in history has been catalyzed by apostolic ministry. Conversely, the omission of apostolic function from the ministry mix has been detrimental to the health and mission of the church.

The result is churches that maintain rather than multiply, that care for insiders rather than reach outsiders, that teach rather than transform, that manage rather than mobilize. They become institutions rather than movements.

**Key Points**:
- Reduced paradigms, institutional dysfunction, spiritual immaturity
- Mission ineffectiveness and loss of movemental capacity
- Churches become institutions rather than movements
- The omission of apostolic function is detrimental

**Examples**:
- Many denominations declined after suppressing APEST functions
- Churches that recover APEST experience renewal
- The early church's decline coincided with the loss of apostolic function

### Q13: How does the apostolic environment relate to recapitulation theology?

**Answer**: The doctrine of recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) explains how Christ takes up all dimensions of humanity—including the fivefold APEST archetypes—and redeems them through his perfect life and sacrificial death. In his ascension, he bequeaths these reconstituted archetypes to the church. The apostolic environment is the space where this recapitulation is lived out.

Christ, as the new representative man (the Second Adam), succeeds where the first Adam failed. He takes up the fallen APEST archetypes and redeems them, giving them their definitive expression. In his ascension, he distributes these reconstituted archetypes to the church as expressions of his ongoing ministry.

The apostolic environment is where this recapitulation becomes reality. It is the space where the redeemed APEST archetypes find expression in the life of the church. When the apostolic environment is present, the church lives out the recapitulation that Christ accomplished. When it is absent, the church fails to express the fullness of what Christ has given.

This gives the apostolic environment deep theological significance. It is not merely a practical framework but the space where Christ's recapitulation of all things finds expression in his people.

**Key Points**:
- Recapitulation explains how Christ redeems APEST archetypes
- The apostolic environment is where recapitulation is lived out
- This gives the environment deep theological significance
- It's the space where Christ's work finds expression

**Examples**:
- The early church lived out recapitulation through full APEST expression
- Movements that recover APEST experience the reality of recapitulation

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapters 5, 6

### Q14: What is the relationship between the apostolic environment and the Body of Christ?

**Answer**: The apostolic environment is the space where the Body of Christ functions according to its God-given design. The church is not merely an effect of Christ but his fullness and Body. The apostolic environment creates the conditions for Christ's ministry to continue through his people.

As the Head, Christ expresses his character and nature through his Body. The apostolic environment is the space where this expression happens. It enables the Body to function as Christ intended—with all five APEST functions contributing to the whole, moving toward maturity and fullness.

The Body metaphor requires us to understand that the church is the real presence of Christ in the world. The apostolic environment is where this presence is activated. It is the space where Christ's ongoing ministry through his people finds expression. Without it, the Body cannot function as intended.

The apostolic environment enables the Body to extend Christ's purposes, guard his truth, network his people, and create the conditions for all ministries to flourish. It is essential for the Body to function as Christ designed.

**Key Points**:
- The apostolic environment enables the Body to function as designed
- It's the space where Christ's ministry continues through his people
- The Body metaphor shows the church as Christ's real presence
- The environment is essential for Body function

**Examples**:
- The early church functioned as Body through the apostolic environment
- Movements that recover APEST experience Body function

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

### Q15: How does the apostolic environment enable networked movements?

**Answer**: The apostolic environment enables networked movements by creating a web of meaning that holds networks together through shared identity and destiny. Unlike hierarchical institutions, networked movements are held together by relationships, shared mission, and common purpose rather than organizational structure.

The apostolic function creates this web through:
1. **Vision and purpose**: Establishing a compelling vision that unites diverse communities
2. **Meaning management**: Creating shared understanding of identity and calling
3. **Translocal connections**: Building relationships across geographic and cultural boundaries
4. **Inspirational authority**: Leading through vision and purpose rather than positional power

This creates movements that can spread rapidly while maintaining unity. Each community relates to the network because it is meaningful for them to do so (by virtue of the gospel itself) and not because they have to. The apostolic environment enables this kind of networked movement.

**Key Points**:
- Networks are held together by meaning, not structure
- The apostolic creates the web of meaning
- Leadership operates through inspirational authority
- Networks enable rapid spread while maintaining unity

**Examples**:
- The early church was a networked movement
- Contemporary movements like NCMI demonstrate networked structure
- Organic church networks show this pattern

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sources**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

### Q16: What role does the apostolic environment play in guarding theological integrity?

**Answer**: The apostolic function includes a custodial role that guards the theological integrity of the movement by protecting against mutations in the primary codes. The apostolic is responsible for ensuring the gospel, ecclesiology, Christology, and eschatology remain pure and faithful to their original intent.

This guarding function is essential because mutations in the DNA can destroy or damage the ecclesia. The apostolic environment creates the conditions where this guarding can happen effectively. It establishes practices, structures, and cultures that maintain theological integrity while allowing for contextual adaptation.

The apostolic doesn't guard through control but through clarity—establishing clear boundaries, providing theological resources, and addressing issues that threaten integrity. The apostolic environment enables this guarding function to operate throughout the movement, not just from a central authority.

**Key Points**:
- The apostolic guards theological integrity
- It protects against mutations in the DNA
- Guarding happens through clarity, not control
- The environment enables guarding throughout the movement

**Examples**:
- Paul's letters address theological issues in various churches
- Movements that lose theological integrity decline
- The apostolic environment maintains DNA while allowing adaptation

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

---

### Q17: How does the apostolic environment relate to the ascension gifting?

**Answer**: The apostolic environment is the space where the ascension gifting of APEST finds expression. Ephesians 4:7-11 describes how Christ, having ascended, distributes APEST ministries as victory gifts to his church. The imagery is drawn from Roman triumphal processions—when a ruler returned victorious, he distributed bounty among the people.

The Greek verb "given" (edothe) signals a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects. This is not a human invention but a divine gift given at a decisive moment in salvation history. The apostolic environment is where these ascension gifts are activated and expressed.

The apostolic environment enables the church to receive and express what Christ has given. Without it, the ascension gifts remain dormant or suppressed. With it, they find full expression, enabling the church to move toward maturity and fullness in Christ.

**Key Points**:
- APEST is given at Christ's ascension
- The apostolic environment is where these gifts find expression
- This is a divine gift, not human invention
- The environment enables the gifts to be activated

**Examples**:
- The early church received and expressed the ascension gifts
- Movements that recover APEST experience the reality of ascension gifting

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapters 2, 5

### Q18: Can small churches create an apostolic environment?

**Answer**: Yes, absolutely. The apostolic environment is not about size but about function. Small churches can create apostolic environments by:
- Activating apostolic function through practices and culture
- Building networks with other small churches
- Guarding theological integrity through clear DNA
- Creating space for all five APEST functions to contribute

In small churches, one person might operate in multiple functions, or functions might be expressed through the community as a whole. The goal is not to have five separate people but to have all five functions contributing to the life of the church. The apostolic environment can be created through intentional practices, even in the smallest of communities.

**Key Points**:
- Size doesn't determine the environment
- Small churches can activate APEST through practices
- Functions can be expressed through the community
- The goal is function, not structure

**Examples**:
- House churches create apostolic environments
- Small missional communities demonstrate this
- Networks of small churches show this pattern

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 5

### Q19: How does the apostolic environment relate to the routinization of charisma?

**Answer**: Max Weber's theory of "routinization of charisma" explains how movements survive beyond their founders. The founder's charisms must be distributed and embedded throughout the organization. By bequeathing APEST, Jesus routinizes his ministry into the ecclesia's foundation.

The apostolic environment is the space where this routinization occurs. It ensures that Jesus' ministry is not dependent on a single charismatic leader but is embedded throughout the community. The apostolic function creates the conditions where Jesus' charisms are distributed and activated throughout the Body.

This is why the apostolic environment is essential—it ensures the movement's DNA is preserved and multiplied beyond any single leader. The apostolic environment routinizes Jesus' ministry into the church's foundation, ensuring it can survive and thrive across generations.

**Key Points**:
- Routinization distributes charisms throughout the organization
- The apostolic environment is where this happens
- It ensures the movement survives beyond founders
- Jesus' ministry is embedded in the community

**Examples**:
- Movements that routinize charisms survive and multiply
- Movements that don't decline after the founder
- The early church routinized Jesus' ministry through APEST

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

### Q20: What practical steps can we take to create an apostolic environment?

**Answer**: Practical steps for creating an apostolic environment include:

1. **Assess current expression**: Evaluate what APEST functions are active and which are missing
2. **Form common values**: Develop shared understanding of identity, purpose, and mission
3. **Build networks**: Connect with other missional communities for collaboration and support
4. **Guard DNA**: Establish practices that maintain theological integrity
5. **Create space**: Intentionally make room for all five functions to emerge
6. **Develop teams**: Build leadership teams that represent the full APEST spectrum
7. **Train and equip**: Provide resources for people to discover and develop their callings
8. **Celebrate diversity**: Value all five functions equally
9. **Extend mission**: Create opportunities for pioneering and seeding
10. **Foster communitas**: Build deep relational bonds through shared mission and risk

The key is starting where you are and moving toward fullness. Create the conditions through practices, structures, and culture. The apostolic environment emerges as these conditions are established.

**Key Points**:
- Start by assessing current expression
- Create conditions through practices, structures, and culture
- Build networks and guard DNA
- The goal is movement toward fullness

**Examples**:
- The Forgotten Ways Handbook provides detailed practices
- Movements that follow these steps experience renewal
- The key is intentionality and persistence

**Related Concepts**: All mDNA elements, especially Organic Systems and Liminality-Communitas
