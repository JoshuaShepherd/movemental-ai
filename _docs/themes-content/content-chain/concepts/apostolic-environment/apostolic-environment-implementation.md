# Apostolic Environment (APEST): Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Apostolic Environment (APEST)  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for implementing the apostolic environment and activating APEST functions  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers  
**Last Updated**: December 9, 2025

## Overview

This guide provides a practical, step-by-step approach to creating an apostolic environment and activating the full expression of APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) ministries in your church or community. The apostolic environment is not about finding the perfect leader or implementing a program—it's about creating the conditions through practices, structures, and culture that enable all five functions to flourish.

This guide is designed for church leaders, ministry teams, and communities who want to move from reduced ministry paradigms (typically just shepherd and teacher) toward the full expression of Christ's ascension gifts. Whether you're starting from scratch or seeking to restore what's been lost, this guide will help you create the conditions for the apostolic environment to emerge.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:
1. What APEST functions are currently active in your church? Which are missing or suppressed?
2. How would you describe your current ministry paradigm? Is it primarily shepherd/teacher focused?
3. Are you experiencing multiplication, or primarily maintenance?
4. Do you have translocal connections with other missional communities?
5. How would you rate your church's theological clarity and integrity?
6. Is your church functioning as a movement or an institution?
7. Are people being equipped for works of service, or primarily consuming services?
8. How would you describe your leadership culture? Is it hierarchical or networked?
9. Are all five APEST functions valued equally, or are some elevated above others?
10. What indicators suggest you're moving toward maturity and fullness in Christ?

### Assessment Tools

#### APEST Function Assessment

**Purpose**: Identify which APEST functions are present, missing, or suppressed

**How to Use**:
1. Gather a diverse group of leaders and members
2. Discuss each APEST function: Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher
3. For each function, ask:
   - Is this function present in our community?
   - Is it valued and given space to operate?
   - Is it suppressed or marginalized?
   - Who embodies this function (if anyone)?
4. Document findings and identify gaps

**Scoring**: 
- **Strong**: Function is present, valued, and actively contributing
- **Moderate**: Function is present but not fully activated
- **Weak**: Function is present but suppressed or marginalized
- **Missing**: Function is not present or recognized

#### Ministry Paradigm Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether you're operating with reduced or full APEST expression

**How to Use**:
1. Review your current ministry structures, programs, and leadership
2. Identify which APEST functions are represented
3. Assess whether you're operating with reduced paradigms (just 1-2 functions) or full expression (all 5 functions)
4. Note any imbalances or suppressions

**Scoring**:
- **Full Expression**: All five functions are active and valued
- **Partial Expression**: 3-4 functions are active
- **Reduced Paradigm**: Only 1-2 functions are active (typically shepherd and teacher)

#### Movement Indicators Assessment

**Purpose**: Determine if you're functioning as a movement or institution

**How to Use**:
1. Evaluate indicators of movement:
   - Multiplication (new expressions, new disciples)
   - Translocal connections
   - Missional effectiveness
   - Theological clarity
   - Maturity development
2. Compare with institutional indicators:
   - Maintenance focus
   - Isolation
   - Inward focus
   - Dependency
   - Immaturity

**Scoring**: Rate each indicator on a scale of 1-10, then calculate average

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Creating Hierarchy Instead of Environment

**Description**: Treating the apostolic as a position of authority rather than a foundational function that creates environment

**Why It Happens**: 
- Confusion about foundational vs. hierarchical leadership
- Desire for clear authority structures
- Misunderstanding of apostolic function

**How to Avoid**:
- Emphasize foundational function, not positional authority
- Use servant-inspirer model, not top-down control
- Create environment through practices, not positions
- Value all five functions equally

**If You're Already There**: 
- Reassess leadership structures
- Shift from positional to functional leadership
- Create space for all functions to contribute
- Emphasize collaborative rather than hierarchical models

### Pitfall 2: Waiting for the Perfect Apostle

**Description**: Believing you need a single apostolic person before you can create an apostolic environment

**Why It Happens**:
- Misunderstanding that environment requires a person
- Desire for clear leadership
- Waiting for God to send the right person

**How to Avoid**:
- Understand that environment can be created through practices
- Activate apostolic function throughout community
- Start where you are, not where you wish you were
- Create conditions, don't wait for perfect leader

**If You're Already There**:
- Begin creating environment through practices
- Activate apostolic function in community
- Build networks and guard DNA
- Don't wait—start creating conditions

### Pitfall 3: Replacing Rather Than Expanding

**Description**: Throwing out existing structures instead of expanding them to include all APEST functions

**Why It Happens**:
- Desire for clean slate
- Frustration with current structures
- Misunderstanding that APEST replaces rather than enriches

**How to Avoid**:
- Understand that APEST expands and enriches
- Keep what works, add what's missing
- Build on existing strengths
- Add rather than subtract

**If You're Already There**:
- Reassess what you've removed
- Restore what was working
- Add missing functions to existing structures
- Build on strengths rather than starting over

### Pitfall 4: Overemphasizing One Function

**Description**: Elevating one APEST function above others, creating imbalance

**Why It Happens**:
- Natural tendency to value what we understand
- Leadership bias toward certain functions
- Cultural preferences for certain ministries

**How to Avoid**:
- Value all five functions equally
- Create space for all functions
- Address biases and preferences
- Develop all functions, not just favorites

**If You're Already There**:
- Identify which functions are overemphasized
- Create space for underemphasized functions
- Address leadership biases
- Work toward balance

### Pitfall 5: Programmatic Approach

**Description**: Treating APEST as a program to implement rather than a framework to live into

**Why It Happens**:
- Desire for clear steps and outcomes
- Programmatic thinking
- Misunderstanding of organic nature

**How to Avoid**:
- Understand APEST as constitutional framework
- Focus on creating conditions, not programs
- Embrace organic development
- Allow for emergence

**If You're Already There**:
- Shift from programmatic to organic thinking
- Focus on creating conditions
- Allow for emergence and adaptation
- Trust the process
