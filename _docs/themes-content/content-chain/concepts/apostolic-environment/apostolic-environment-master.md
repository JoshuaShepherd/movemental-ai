## Executive Summary

The apostolic environment is the foundational field that gives birth to all other ministries in the Body of Christ. It is the space where the apostolic function creates the conditions necessary for the full expression of APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) ministries to emerge and flourish. This environment is not merely organizational structure—it is the theo-genetic foundation that hosts the DNA of Jesus' church and forms the reference point for all other ministries.

**Key Points:**
- The apostolic function creates the environment that gives birth to all other APEST ministries
- APEST is the constitutional DNA of the church, given by Christ at his ascension (Ephesians 4:7-11)
- The apostolic environment is foundational because it seeds and guards the genetic codes of ecclesia
- Without the apostolic environment, churches operate with reduced ministry paradigms (typically just shepherd and teacher)
- The apostolic environment enables translocal, networked movements rather than isolated institutions
- All five APEST functions are necessary for the church to reach maturity and fullness in Christ
- The apostolic function operates through four critical functions: pioneering/seeding, guarding/custodianship, networked movement, and creating environment for other ministries

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

The apostolic environment is the foundational field created by the apostolic function that gives birth to all other ministries in the Body of Christ. It is not simply a leadership style or organizational structure, but the theo-genetic foundation that hosts the DNA of Jesus' church. This environment is the space where the full expression of APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) ministries can emerge, flourish, and produce the fruit they are intended to produce.

The apostolic environment exists because the apostolic function is foundational—it is listed first in all New Testament ministry lists (1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11) and is described as part of the foundation of the church alongside the prophetic function (Ephesians 2:20). This primacy is not about hierarchy but about foundational function: the apostolic creates the proper context and springboard for all other ministries.

At its core, the apostolic environment is characterized by four critical functions:

1. **Pioneering/Seeding**: The apostolic function extends the mission of the church by planting the gospel in new territories and cultures, embedding the DNA of Jesus' church in fresh contexts.

2. **Guarding/Custodianship**: The apostolic function maintains the theological integrity of the movement by guarding against mutations in the primary codes—the gospel, ecclesiology, Christology, and eschatology—that would destroy or damage the ecclesia.

3. **Networked Movement**: The apostolic function cultivates translocal, fully networked movements through vision, purpose, and the management of meaning, creating a web of relationships held together by shared identity and destiny.

4. **Creating Environment for Other Ministries**: The apostolic function creates the field in which the prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries can emerge and function effectively.

This environment is not optional—it is the constitutional design of the church as revealed in Ephesians 4:1-16. When churches operate without the apostolic environment, they cannot achieve the maturity and fullness in Christ that is their God-intended destiny.

### Common Misunderstandings

**Misunderstanding 1: APEST is about hierarchical leadership**
Many assume that listing the apostle first means establishing a hierarchy where apostles have authority over other ministers. This misses the point entirely. The apostolic is foundational, not hierarchical. It creates the environment that enables other ministries to emerge, but it does not control or dominate them. The apostolic function operates through inspirational authority based on vision, meaning, and purpose—not transactional authority based on position or power.

**Misunderstanding 2: APEST is only for certain people**
Some think APEST describes special roles for a select few leaders. In reality, APEST describes functions given to the entire Body of Christ. While individuals may have a primary gifting in one area, all five functions are needed in every church, and every believer participates in the APEST system. The apostolic environment is not created by one person but by the activation of apostolic function throughout the community.

**Misunderstanding 3: The apostolic environment is about church planting**
While church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, the apostolic environment is much broader. It includes the pioneering impulse that extends mission, but it also includes the custodial function that guards theological integrity, the networking function that creates translocal movements, and the environmental function that enables all ministries to flourish. The apostolic environment is about creating the conditions for missional movement, not just starting new churches.

**Misunderstanding 4: APEST replaces existing ministry structures**
Some fear that embracing APEST means abandoning current ministry models. In reality, APEST expands and enriches existing structures. The goal is not replacement but restoration—bringing the full spectrum of Christ's ascension gifts back into the life of the church. Churches can maintain their current structures while activating dormant APEST functions.

**Misunderstanding 5: The apostolic environment requires apostolic people**
While apostolic people are important, the apostolic environment can be created even when no one person embodies the full apostolic function. The environment is created through practices, structures, and culture that activate apostolic function throughout the community. It's about creating the conditions, not waiting for the perfect leader.

### Why It Matters

The apostolic environment matters because it is the constitutional design of the church. Ephesians 4:1-16 is not optional advice—it is the foundational framework that defines who the church is and how it functions. When churches operate without the apostolic environment, they cannot achieve their God-intended purpose.

**Without the apostolic environment, churches experience:**

- **Reduced ministry paradigms**: Churches typically operate with only shepherd and teacher functions, creating a care-and-instruction model that lacks missional dynamism.

- **Institutional dysfunction**: Without apostolic multiplication, churches stop at evangelistic addition. Without apostolic action, churches fail to experience the promised presence of Christ. Without apostolic clarity, identity and purpose become murky.

- **Spiritual immaturity**: The church cannot reach "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13) when operating with reduced ministry paradigms. The missing apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions create systemic deficiencies.

- **Mission ineffectiveness**: Without the apostolic environment, churches struggle to extend mission, adapt to new contexts, and create translocal movements. They become isolated institutions rather than networked movements.

- **Loss of movemental capacity**: Every significant Jesus movement in history has been catalyzed by apostolic ministry. Conversely, the omission of apostolic function from the ministry mix has been detrimental to the health and mission of the church.

**With the apostolic environment, churches experience:**

- **Full ministry expression**: All five APEST functions contribute to the life of the church, creating a rich, diverse ministry ecosystem.

- **Movemental multiplication**: The apostolic environment enables churches to multiply, extend mission, and create translocal networks.

- **Theological integrity**: The custodial function of the apostolic guards against mutations in the gospel and ecclesial DNA.

- **Maturity and fullness**: The church moves toward "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" as all five functions work together.

- **Missional effectiveness**: The apostolic environment creates the conditions for missional-incarnational impulse to flourish.

### Biblical Foundations

The apostolic environment is grounded in several key biblical texts:

**Ephesians 4:1-16** is the primary constitutional text. This passage reveals:
- The unity of the church (vv. 1-6)
- The ascension gifting of APEST ministries (vv. 7-11)
- The purpose: equipping for works of service and building up the body until maturity (vv. 12-16)

**Ephesians 2:20** establishes the foundational nature of apostolic and prophetic ministry: "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

**1 Corinthians 12:28** lists the ministries, with apostles first: "God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues."

**Ephesians 4:7-11** describes the ascension gifting: "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: 'When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.'... So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers."

These texts establish that:
1. APEST is given by Christ at his ascension—a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects
2. The apostolic is foundational, listed first in all ministry lists
3. All five functions are necessary for the church to reach maturity
4. The purpose is equipping all God's people for works of service

### Theological Framework

The apostolic environment is grounded in several key theological frameworks:

**Recapitulation (Anakephalaiosis)**: Christ, as the new representative man (the Second Adam), takes up all dimensions of humanity—including the fivefold APEST archetypes—and redeems them through his perfect life and sacrificial death. In his ascension, he bequeaths these reconstituted archetypes to the church as expressions of his ongoing ministry.

**The Body of Christ**: The church is not merely an effect of Christ but his fullness and Body. The apostolic environment is the space where Christ's ministry continues through his people. As the Head, Christ expresses his character and nature through his Body, and the apostolic environment creates the conditions for this expression.

**The Ascension Gifting**: The imagery of Ephesians 4:8-10 draws from Roman triumphal processions. When a ruler returned victorious, he distributed bounty among the people. Similarly, Christ, having triumphed over sin and death, distributes the APEST ministries as victory gifts to his church. These are not human inventions but divine gifts given at a decisive moment in salvation history.

**Constitutional Theology**: Ephesians 4:1-16 functions as constitutional theology—the foundational document that defines the church's identity, structure, and purpose. Like a national constitution, it guides all subsequent thinking and action. The apostolic environment is not optional but constitutional.

**The Routinization of Charisma**: Max Weber's theory explains how movements survive beyond their founders. The founder's charisms must be distributed and embedded throughout the organization. By bequeathing APEST, Jesus routinizes his ministry into the ecclesia's foundation. The apostolic environment is the space where this routinization occurs.

### Historical Examples

**The Early Church**: The New Testament church operated with a full APEST expression. The apostles (Paul, Peter, James, John) created the environment for prophets (Agabus, the daughters of Philip), evangelists (Philip, Timothy), shepherds (the elders in various cities), and teachers (Apollos, Priscilla and Aquila) to flourish. This created a translocal, networked movement that spread rapidly across the Roman Empire.

**Early Methodism**: John Wesley exemplified high 5Q capacities, embodying all five APEST functions. He was apostolic (movement starter), prophetic (advocate for holiness and justice), evangelistic (tireless preacher), shepherding (created systems of care), and teaching (committed to discipleship). The Methodist movement spread rapidly because it operated in an apostolic environment. However, many Wesleyan denominations later suppressed parts of APEST, leading to decline.

**The Celtic Missions**: Patrick, Columbanus, and Aidan were classic Pauline apostles—cross-cultural pioneers who extended Christianity into new territories. The Celtic movement reached far beyond Ireland's shores because it operated in an apostolic environment that activated all five functions.

**The Vineyard Movement**: Under John Wimber, the early Vineyard movement operated with an apostolic environment. Wimber's apostolic leadership catalyzed prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries, creating a movement that spread rapidly.

**New Covenant Ministries International (NCMI)**: Started by apostolic founder Dudley Daniel in the early 1980s, NCMI describes itself not as a denomination but as "a movement of God's people committed to advancing the kingdom of God through mission and networking." They have planted thousands of churches worldwide through an apostolic network led by apostolic-prophetic teams, held together by common purpose and friendships.

**The Organic Church Movement**: Neil Cole and the associated organic church movement start two to four new churches every day (not counting second and third generation churches). Such results are inconceivable without a fivefold APEST form operating in an apostolic environment.

**Contemporary Examples**: Pope Francis exhibits all five APEST functions, and his renewal of the church reflects their ongoing necessity. Movements like New Thing Network, Hope Chapel, and various house church networks demonstrate the power of the apostolic environment.

**Refinements** (*The Permanent Revolution*, 2012): Expanded understanding of the apostolic environment through detailed exploration of four critical functions, Pauline/Petrine distinctions, and the morphology of apostolic types. Emphasized the environmental function—how the apostolic creates space for other ministries.

**Current Understanding** (*5Q*, 2016): Deepened theological foundation through recapitulation theology, constitutional framework, and "Sense" as the ever-present template. Emphasized that APEST is not optional but constitutional—the God-given design of the church.

**Practical Application** (*The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, 2009): Provided concrete habits and practices for creating apostolic environments, moving from theory to implementation.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### The Four Critical Functions of Apostolic Ministry

The apostolic function operates through four critical functions that create the apostolic environment:

1. **Pioneering/Seeding**: Extending the mission of the church by planting the gospel in new territories and cultures. This is the external drive that embeds the gospel/DNA in fresh contexts.

2. **Guarding/Custodianship**: Maintaining the theological integrity of the movement by guarding against mutations in the primary codes. This is the internal impulse that ensures the integrity of the DNA.

3. **Networked Movement**: Cultivating translocal, fully networked movements through vision, purpose, and the management of meaning. This creates the web of relationships that holds the movement together.

4. **Creating Environment for Other Ministries**: The apostolic function creates the field in which the prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries can emerge and function effectively.

#### Pauline and Petrine Apostolic Models

The distinction between Pauline and Petrine apostolic ministry helps us understand different expressions of the apostolic environment:

**Pauline Model (Cross-Cultural Pioneer Founder)**: Called to extend and establish Christianity onto new ground. More translocal, itinerant, entrepreneurial. Thrives in wide-open frontiers. Examples: Hudson Taylor, Roland Allen, Neil Cole, Dave Ferguson.

**Petrine Model (Intracultural Visionary Architect)**: Called to reframe the identity and mission of existing churches. More internally focused, less cross-cultural, intrapreneurial. Works within existing contexts to mobilize for mission. Examples: Alan Hirsch, Mike Breen, Reggie McNeal, Tim Keller.

Both models share core functions (custodian, guardian, networker, translocal activity) but differ in focus and approach. The Pauline extends mission; the Petrine remissionalizes the church.

#### The Morphology of Apostolic Types

Building on Pauline/Petrine distinctions, we can identify four apostolic types:

1. **Pioneers** (Pauline Explorers): Classic missionaries, boundary crossers, risk-takers. Examples: Hudson Taylor, Patrick of Ireland.

2. **Miners** (Petrine Explorers): Explore deep structures within existing communities. Focus on unearthing theological and systemic treasures. More internally focused.

3. **Networkers** (Pauline Catalysts): Build translocal networks, connect movements, facilitate collaboration. Examples: Dave Ferguson (New Thing Network).

4. **Mobilizers** (Petrine Catalysts): Mobilize existing communities for mission. Work within organizations to create change. Examples: Alan Roxburgh, Reggie McNeal.

#### Sense: The Ever-Present Template

"Sense" is Alan's term for the ever-present, primordial template of APEST that seeks expression in every church throughout history. Even when suppressed or unrecognized, Sense exerts pressure on the church to conform to Jesus' original design. This explains why:
- Churches struggle with identity when operating with reduced ministry paradigms
- Revival movements typically rediscover apostolic and prophetic functions
- Healthy churches naturally develop all five APEST functions, even without using that language
- The church feels most alive when all five ministries are active

#### Constitutional Theology

Ephesians 4:1-16 functions as constitutional theology—the foundational document that defines the church's identity, structure, and purpose. Like a national constitution, it:
- Establishes foundational principles (unity in diversity)
- Defines organizational structure (APEST ministries)
- Outlines ultimate purposes (maturity and fullness in Christ)
- Provides ongoing guidance for all subsequent church life and ministry

When churches ignore or reduce this constitutional framework, they operate outside their God-given design.

#### Recapitulation and APEST

The doctrine of recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) explains how Christ takes up all dimensions of humanity—including the fivefold APEST archetypes—and redeems them through his perfect life and sacrificial death. In his ascension, he bequeaths these reconstituted archetypes to the church. The apostolic environment is the space where this recapitulation is lived out.

#### The Routinization of Charisma

Max Weber's theory explains how movements survive beyond their founders. The founder's charisms must be distributed and embedded throughout the organization. By bequeathing APEST, Jesus routinizes his ministry into the ecclesia's foundation. The apostolic environment is where this routinization occurs, ensuring the movement's DNA is preserved and multiplied.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Early Church: Full APEST Expression

The New Testament church operated with a full APEST expression. The apostles (Paul, Peter, James, John) created the environment for prophets (Agabus, the daughters of Philip), evangelists (Philip, Timothy), shepherds (the elders in various cities), and teachers (Apollos, Priscilla and Aquila) to flourish. This created a translocal, networked movement that spread rapidly across the Roman Empire. The apostolic environment enabled each function to contribute to the whole, creating a movement that transformed the known world.

#### John Wesley: High 5Q Capacities

John Wesley exemplified high 5Q capacities, embodying all five APEST functions. He was:
- **Apostolic**: Movement starter and adaptive system builder
- **Prophetic**: Advocate for social and personal holiness, abolition of slavery, workers' rights
- **Evangelistic**: Tireless preacher, mass communicator
- **Shepherding**: Created systems of care for the poor and broken
- **Teaching**: Committed to discipleship and prolific in teaching

The Methodist movement spread rapidly because it operated in an apostolic environment. However, many Wesleyan denominations later suppressed parts of APEST, leading to decline—demonstrating the fatal flaw of "un-routinizing" founding charisms.

#### The Celtic Missions: Classic Pauline Apostles

Patrick, Columbanus, and Aidan were classic Pauline apostles—cross-cultural pioneers who extended Christianity into new territories. The Celtic movement reached far beyond Ireland's shores because it operated in an apostolic environment that activated all five functions. The apostolic function created the environment for prophetic witness, evangelistic proclamation, shepherding care, and teaching wisdom to flourish in new cultural contexts.

#### The Organic Church Movement: Exponential Multiplication

Neil Cole and the associated organic church movement start two to four new churches every day (not counting second and third generation churches). Such results are inconceivable without a fivefold APEST form operating in an apostolic environment. The apostolic function creates the conditions for rapid multiplication by embedding the DNA in simple, reproducible forms.

#### New Covenant Ministries International: Apostolic Network

Started by apostolic founder Dudley Daniel in the early 1980s, NCMI describes itself not as a denomination but as "a movement of God's people committed to advancing the kingdom of God through mission and networking." They have planted thousands of churches worldwide through an apostolic network led by apostolic-prophetic teams, held together by common purpose and friendships. The apostolic environment enables translocal movement while maintaining unity and purpose.

#### The Early Vineyard Movement: Apostolic Catalysis

Under John Wimber, the early Vineyard movement operated with an apostolic environment. Wimber's apostolic leadership catalyzed prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries, creating a movement that spread rapidly. The apostolic function created the environment for the other ministries to emerge and flourish.

### Practical Applications

**Creating Apostolic Environments in Local Churches**:
- Assess current ministry paradigms against the full APEST spectrum
- Identify gaps and suppressions in the church's expression of fivefold ministry
- Develop strategies for activation of dormant or missing APEST functions
- Create organizational cultures that welcome and support diverse ministry callings
- Form common values, beliefs, and practices around APEST understanding
- Network extensively with other missional communities
- Build organic systems that support APEST expression

**Developing Apostolic Function**:
- Recognize all five APEST functions as legitimate and necessary
- Provide space for each function to operate
- Create structures that support rather than suppress APEST expression
- Develop leadership teams that represent the full APEST spectrum
- Train and equip people in their APEST callings

**Building Networked Movements**:
- Cultivate translocal relationships based on shared mission
- Create meaning webs that hold networks together
- Develop simple, reproducible forms that can multiply
- Guard the DNA while allowing local adaptation
- Facilitate collaboration and resource sharing

### Common Questions Addressed

**Q: Do we need an apostle to have an apostolic environment?**
A: While apostolic people are helpful, the apostolic environment can be created through practices, structures, and culture that activate apostolic function throughout the community. It's about creating the conditions, not waiting for the perfect leader.

**Q: How do we activate APEST if we don't have all five functions present?**
A: Start by identifying what is present and what is missing. Create space for missing functions to emerge. Sometimes functions are present but suppressed. Sometimes they need to be developed. The goal is to move toward full expression, not achieve it immediately.

**Q: Does APEST replace our current ministry structures?**
A: No. APEST expands and enriches existing structures. The goal is restoration—bringing the full spectrum of Christ's gifts back into the life of the church. Churches can maintain current structures while activating dormant APEST functions.

**Q: How do we know if we're operating in an apostolic environment?**
A: Indicators include: multiplication happening, translocal connections, theological integrity maintained, all five functions contributing, movemental momentum, and maturity developing.

### Misconceptions and Corrections

**Misconception**: APEST is about hierarchical leadership.
**Correction**: APEST is about foundational function, not hierarchy. The apostolic creates the environment but doesn't control other ministries.

**Misconception**: APEST is only for certain special people.
**Correction**: APEST describes functions given to the entire Body of Christ. While individuals may have primary gifting, all five functions are needed in every church.

**Misconception**: The apostolic environment requires apostolic people.
**Correction**: The environment can be created through practices, structures, and culture that activate apostolic function throughout the community.

**Misconception**: APEST replaces existing ministry structures.
**Correction**: APEST expands and enriches existing structures. The goal is restoration, not replacement.

### Connections to Other Concepts

**Jesus is Lord**: The organizing center that shapes the apostolic environment. When Jesus is truly Lord, the apostolic function operates in proper alignment.

**Disciple Making**: APEST exists to equip all God's people for works of service, which includes making disciples. The apostolic environment creates the conditions for effective disciple making.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The apostolic environment enables the missional-incarnational impulse to flourish by creating the conditions for sending and embedding.

**Organic Systems**: The apostolic environment operates through organic, networked systems rather than mechanical, hierarchical structures.

**Liminality-Communitas**: The apostolic environment thrives in liminal spaces where communitas is formed through shared mission and risk.

## 4. Scripture Reference Index

### Primary Scripture References

#### Ephesians 4:1-16

**Text**: 
"As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all... But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: 'When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.'... So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

**Context**: Paul's letter to the Ephesian church, written from prison. This passage is the pivotal section where Paul moves from theology to praxis, providing the constitutional framework for the church.

**Alan's Interpretation**: This is the constitutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is meant to guide all subsequent thinking and action. The passage reveals three natural sections: (1) Foundations for unity (vv. 1-6), (2) The ascension gifting of APEST (vv. 7-11), and (3) Attaining maturity and fullness (vv. 12-16). The Greek verb for "given" (edothe) signals a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects. All five APEST ministries are bound together under the ruling verb—none may be omitted without violating the grammar and logic of the text.

**Theological Significance**: This passage establishes APEST as the constitutional DNA of the church, given by Christ at his ascension. The purpose is clear: to equip all God's people for works of service so the body may be built up until maturity. When churches operate with reduced ministry paradigms, they cannot achieve this maturity.

#### Ephesians 2:20

**Text**: "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."

**Context**: Paul's description of the church as God's household, built on the foundation of apostolic and prophetic ministry.

**Alan's Interpretation**: This establishes the foundational nature of apostolic and prophetic ministry. The apostolic is listed first not because of hierarchy but because it is foundational—it creates the environment that gives birth to all other ministries. Together with the prophetic, it establishes the foundational ministry of the church.

**Theological Significance**: This verse grounds the primacy of apostolic ministry in the church's very foundation. The apostolic environment is not optional but foundational to the church's existence.

#### 1 Corinthians 12:28

**Text**: "And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues."

**Context**: Paul's discussion of spiritual gifts and the diversity of the Body of Christ.

**Alan's Interpretation**: The apostolic is listed first in all New Testament ministry lists, establishing its foundational nature. This is not about hierarchy but about foundational function—the apostolic creates the environment for other ministries.

**Theological Significance**: This confirms the pattern seen in Ephesians: the apostolic is foundational, creating the environment for other ministries to emerge.

**Source**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

#### Ephesians 4:7-11

**Text**: "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: 'When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.' (What does 'he ascended' mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers."

**Context**: The ascension gifting passage, explaining how Christ distributes ministries to his church.

**Alan's Interpretation**: The imagery is drawn from Roman triumphal processions. When a ruler returned victorious, he distributed bounty among the people. Similarly, Christ, having triumphed over sin and death, distributes APEST ministries as victory gifts. The Greek verb "given" (edothe) signals a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects. This is not a human invention but a divine gift given at a decisive moment in salvation history.

**Theological Significance**: This establishes APEST as ascension gifting—given by Christ at a specific moment in salvation history, with ongoing effects. The apostolic environment is the space where these gifts are activated and expressed.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapters 2, 5

#### Colossians 1:15-20

**Text**: "The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy."

**Context**: Paul's description of Christ's supremacy and his relationship to the church.

**Alan's Interpretation**: This comprehensive language gives us a vision of the universal and cosmic significance of Jesus. The church is not merely an effect of Christ but his fullness and Body. The apostolic environment is the space where Christ's headship is expressed through his Body.

**Theological Significance**: The apostolic environment exists because Christ is Head of the Body. The environment is the space where Christ's ministry continues through his people.

## 5. Concept Relationships

### Dependencies

The apostolic environment depends on:
- **Jesus is Lord**: The organizing center that shapes the apostolic environment. When Jesus is truly Lord, the apostolic function operates in proper alignment.
- **The Ascension**: The decisive moment when APEST was given to the church. Without the ascension gifting, there is no apostolic environment.
- **The Gospel**: The DNA that the apostolic function seeds and guards. The apostolic environment exists to extend and protect the gospel.

### Contains

The apostolic environment contains:
- **The Four Critical Functions**: Pioneering/seeding, guarding/custodianship, networked movement, creating environment for other ministries
- **APEST Ministries**: The fivefold expression of Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher
- **Networked Relationships**: The translocal connections that hold movements together
- **Theological Integrity**: The guarding function that maintains the gospel and ecclesial DNA

### Related Concepts

**Disciple Making**: APEST exists to equip all God's people for works of service, which includes making disciples. The apostolic environment creates the conditions for effective disciple making.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The apostolic environment enables the missional-incarnational impulse to flourish by creating the conditions for sending and embedding.

**Organic Systems**: The apostolic environment operates through organic, networked systems rather than mechanical, hierarchical structures.

**Liminality-Communitas**: The apostolic environment thrives in liminal spaces where communitas is formed through shared mission and risk.

### Integration Patterns

**With Jesus is Lord**: The apostolic environment is shaped by the organizing center of "Jesus is Lord." When Jesus is truly Lord, the apostolic function operates in proper alignment with his purposes.

**With Disciple Making**: The apostolic environment creates the conditions for effective disciple making by activating all five APEST functions, which equip people for works of service.

**With Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The apostolic environment enables the missional-incarnational impulse by creating the conditions for sending (apostolic) and embedding (incarnational).

**With Organic Systems**: The apostolic environment operates through organic systems—decentralized, networked, self-replicating structures that support APEST expression.

**With Liminality-Communitas**: The apostolic environment thrives in liminal spaces where communitas is formed. The shared risk and mission create the conditions for deep relational bonds and APEST activation.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

In *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), Alan initially presented APEST as one of six elements of Apostolic Genius. The focus was on APEST culture as essential for missional movement, but the emphasis was primarily on the apostolic function itself rather than the environment it creates. The concept was introduced as part of the mDNA framework, establishing its importance but not yet fully developing the environmental dimension.

### Refinements

In *The Permanent Revolution* (2012, with Tim Catchim), Alan significantly expanded the understanding of the apostolic environment. The book detailed the four critical functions of apostolic ministry:
1. Pioneering/seeding
2. Guarding/custodianship  
3. Networked movement
4. Creating environment for other ministries

This last function—creating environment for other ministries—was a key refinement. The book also introduced the Pauline/Petrine distinction and the morphology of apostolic types (pioneers, miners, networkers, mobilizers), providing a more nuanced understanding of how the apostolic environment can be expressed.

The book also emphasized the environmental function more explicitly, showing how the apostolic creates the field in which other ministries can emerge and flourish. This was a significant development from the earlier focus on the apostolic function itself.

### Current Understanding

In *5Q* (2016), Alan deepened the theological foundation of the apostolic environment through several key developments:

1. **Constitutional Theology**: Established Ephesians 4:1-16 as the constitutional document of the church, making APEST not optional but constitutional.

2. **Recapitulation Theology**: Explained how Christ takes up the APEST archetypes and redeems them through recapitulation, bequeathing them to the church at his ascension.

3. **Sense**: Introduced the concept of "Sense" as the ever-present, primordial template of APEST that seeks expression in every church throughout history, even when suppressed.

4. **The Routinization of Charisma**: Applied Max Weber's theory to explain how Jesus routinizes his ministry into the ecclesia's foundation through APEST.

These developments moved the understanding of the apostolic environment from a practical framework to a deep theological foundation, grounded in Christology, ecclesiology, and the doctrine of the ascension.

### Practical Application

In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009, with Darryn Altclass), Alan provided concrete habits and practices for creating apostolic environments:
- Forming common values, beliefs, and practices
- Networking and communicating extensively
- Creating organic systems
- Cultivating communitas

This moved the concept from theory to implementation, providing practical tools for churches to create apostolic environments.

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "We don't have an apostle, so we can't have an apostolic environment."

**Alan's Response**: While apostolic people are helpful, the apostolic environment can be created through practices, structures, and culture that activate apostolic function throughout the community. It's about creating the conditions, not waiting for the perfect leader. The environment is created by the activation of apostolic function, which can happen through various means: practices that extend mission, structures that guard DNA, networks that create translocal connections, and cultures that enable all ministries to flourish.

**Source**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 5

### Objection 2: "APEST sounds hierarchical—doesn't listing the apostle first create a power structure?"

**Alan's Response**: The apostolic is listed first not because of hierarchy but because of foundational function. The apostolic creates the environment that enables other ministries to emerge, but it does not control or dominate them. The leadership dynamic is that of a servant-inspirer model, not one who "lords it over others." The apostolic function operates through inspirational authority based on vision, meaning, and purpose—not transactional authority based on position or power.

**Source**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5; *The Forgotten Ways*, Introduction

### Objection 3: "This seems to replace our current ministry structures."

**Alan's Response**: APEST does not replace existing structures but expands and enriches them. The goal is restoration—bringing the full spectrum of Christ's ascension gifts back into the life of the church. Churches can maintain their current structures while activating dormant APEST functions. This is about addition, not subtraction—expanding the ministry ecosystem to include all five functions.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapter 2; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

### Objection 4: "We're a small church—we can't have all five functions."

**Alan's Response**: APEST describes functions, not necessarily full-time roles. In a small church, one person might operate in multiple functions, or functions might be expressed through the community as a whole. The goal is not to have five separate people but to have all five functions contributing to the life of the church. Even in small churches, the apostolic environment can be created through practices and culture that activate all five functions.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 5

### Objection 5: "This sounds like it's only for missional churches."

**Alan's Response**: The apostolic environment is the constitutional design of the church, not just for missional churches. All churches are called to operate according to their God-given design. While missional churches may be more intentional about activating APEST, the framework applies to all churches. The apostolic environment enables any church to move toward maturity and fullness in Christ.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapter 2; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 5

### Objection 6: "We've tried this before and it didn't work."

**Alan's Response**: The apostolic environment is not a program or technique but a constitutional framework. Success depends on understanding it as the God-given design of the church, not a human innovation. It requires a shift in thinking from programs to functions, from hierarchy to environment, from control to activation. The key is creating the conditions for APEST to emerge, not forcing it through programs.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapter 2; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 5

### Objection 7: "This seems to devalue pastoral and teaching ministries."

**Alan's Response**: APEST does not devalue any ministry but recognizes that all five are necessary. The problem is not that pastoral and teaching ministries are bad, but that operating with only these two creates an imbalanced system. The apostolic environment enables all five functions to flourish, including pastoral and teaching. The goal is fullness, not reduction.
