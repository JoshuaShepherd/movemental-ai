## Introduction

Apostolic ministry is often misunderstood, feared, or ignored in contemporary church life. This FAQ addresses the most common questions about apostolic ministry, drawing from Alan's comprehensive corpus. Each answer is written in his voice to ensure accuracy and authenticity, helping readers understand what apostolic ministry is, why it matters, and how it functions in the life of the church.

Apostolic ministry lies at the heart of missional movement. When it functions well, churches become movements that transform neighborhoods and extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. When it is absent or suppressed, churches become static institutions focused on maintenance rather than mission. Understanding apostolic ministry is essential for the church to fulfill its calling.

## Questions

### Q1: What is apostolic ministry?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry is the sent, founding, extending ministry that lies at the heart of missional movement. The term "apostle" derives from the Greek verb *apostello*, meaning "to send"—an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender. Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God's eternal purposes (John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1). He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption.

Apostolic ministry extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks. It functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that the movement multiplies rather than merely expands. Apostolic intelligence (AQ) involves pioneering new work, architecting systems that multiply, building translocal connections, and initiating movements that transform communities.

**Key Points**:
- Apostolic ministry is about sentness—being commissioned and empowered to extend the gospel
- It functions as custodian of missional DNA, ensuring multiplication and movement health
- It operates at individual, community, and movement levels
- It is constitutional and essential, not optional or historical

**Examples**:
- The early church extending the gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth (Acts)
- Patrick extending the gospel to Ireland and sending missionaries throughout Europe
- John Wesley creating a movement that transformed England and extended to America

### Q2: Didn't apostles end with the original twelve?

**Answer**: The original apostles had a unique foundational role, but the apostolic function continues as an essential gift to the church. The New Testament itself speaks of apostles beyond the twelve, including Paul, Barnabas, Andronicus, and Junia (Romans 16:7). The book of Acts shows the ongoing function of apostolic ministry as the gospel extended throughout the known world.

Church history demonstrates the continual emergence of apostolic figures across the ages: Patrick, Francis of Assisi, Thérèse of Lisieux, John Wesley, Catherine Booth, Martin Luther King Jr., and countless others. Cessationism cannot account for this historical reality. If God's gifts and callings were meant to cease, why do we see such clear evidence of apostolic ministry throughout church history?

The crucial issue is discerning the degree to which all subsequent apostolic functions reflect (without superseding) the unique, foundational role of the original twelve within church history. We extract the "little a" from the "Big A," recognizing that all apostolic functions are rooted primarily in Jesus Himself.

**Key Points**:
- Original apostles had unique foundational role, but apostolic function continues
- New Testament speaks of apostles beyond the twelve
- Church history shows continual emergence of apostolic figures
- Cessationism cannot account for historical reality

**Examples**:
- Paul as apostle to the Gentiles
- Barnabas and others sent by the church at Antioch (Acts 13:1–3)
- Historical apostolic figures: Patrick, Francis, Wesley

### Q3: Isn't apostolic ministry just about hierarchical authority?

**Answer**: This objection confuses apostolic function with hierarchical office. Apostolic ministry is about sentness and multiplication, not about power or hierarchy. When apostolic ministry is distorted into hierarchical authority, it subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus' leadership (Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11).

Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us" (Greek: *hekasto*)—literally, "to each and every person." All believers, across gender, race, and status, fit somewhere within APEST. This is not primarily a leadership text, but a ministry text. Every believer is endowed with a gifting, and ministry is a calling distinct from leadership. Leadership is a calling within a calling—some are gifted apostolically, but not all are to lead.

The way forward is to recognize APEST as the means by which the ministry of Christ is expressed through the whole Body, leading to its fullness and missional vitality. Leadership should emerge from *within* these distributed gifts, not be imposed above them. Approaching the fivefold with this Christological understanding frees us from the destructive power dynamics that have plagued much of church history.

**Key Points**:
- Apostolic ministry is about sentness, not hierarchy
- It is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just leaders
- Ministry is distinct from leadership
- Leadership emerges from within distributed gifts

**Examples**:
- Jesus' model of servant leadership (Luke 22:24–26)
- Early church sending from within the community (Acts 13:1–3)
- APEST as ministry for all, not leadership for a few

**Related Concepts**: APEST Framework, Jesus is Lord

### Q4: Is apostolic ministry only for church planters?

**Answer**: While church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, it is not the only expression. Apostolic ministry can manifest in starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, creating systems that multiply, or pioneering new work in any context. The key is not the specific activity but the apostolic function: extending the gospel into new ground and multiplying disciples and communities.

Apostolic ministry operates at multiple levels. At the individual level, it involves being sent into one's neighborhood, workplace, or sphere of influence. At the community level, it involves planting new churches, starting new missional communities, or initiating new expressions of church. At the movement level, it involves building networks, creating systems that multiply, and sustaining the health of the broader movement.

The question is not "Am I a church planter?" but "How am I extending the gospel into new contexts? How am I multiplying disciples and communities? How am I creating systems that reproduce?"

**Key Points**:
- Church planting is one expression, not the only expression
- Apostolic ministry operates at individual, community, and movement levels
- The key is the apostolic function, not the specific activity
- Focus on extending gospel and multiplying disciples

**Examples**:
- Starting a small group in a neighborhood
- Initiating a ministry to a specific community
- Building networks that connect churches and movements
- Creating training systems that multiply leaders

**Related Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Organic Systems

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2, 3

### Q5: How do we identify apostolic gifting in people?

**Answer**: Apostolic gifting manifests in several ways. People with apostolic gifting are drawn to extending the gospel into new contexts. They think in terms of multiplication rather than expansion. They build systems that can be replicated. They create networks that connect people and resources. They pioneer new work, often with limited resources and significant risk.

Apostolic intelligence (AQ) involves several key capacities: pioneering new work, architecting systems that multiply, building translocal connections, and initiating movements. People with apostolic gifting often ask questions like: "How do we extend into this new context? How do we multiply this? How do we build systems that reproduce?"

However, we must be careful not to confuse apostolic gifting with other gifts. Entrepreneurial skills can serve any of the fivefold functions. The key is not the skills but the function: extending the gospel and multiplying disciples and communities. Apostolic gifting is about sentness and multiplication, not just about starting things.

**Key Points**:
- Drawn to extending gospel into new contexts
- Think in terms of multiplication, not expansion
- Build systems that can be replicated
- Create networks and pioneer new work

**Examples**:
- People who naturally think about multiplication
- Those who build systems others can replicate
- Network builders who connect people and resources
- Pioneers willing to take risks for the gospel

### Q6: What does apostolic ministry look like in established churches?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry in established churches involves extending the gospel into new contexts, creating systems that multiply, and building networks that connect the church to the broader movement. It might involve starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, or building partnerships with other churches and movements.

The key is to shift from maintenance to mission, from expansion to multiplication. Established churches often focus on making existing systems larger. Apostolic ministry asks: "How do we multiply? How do we extend into new contexts? How do we create systems that reproduce?"

This might involve sending people to start new communities, creating training systems that multiply leaders, or building networks that extend the church's impact. The goal is not to make the existing church larger but to multiply disciples and communities that extend the gospel.

**Key Points**:
- Shift from maintenance to mission, expansion to multiplication
- Start new missional communities and ministries
- Create systems that multiply leaders and communities
- Build networks that extend impact

**Examples**:
- Sending teams to start new missional communities
- Creating leadership development that multiplies
- Building partnerships with other churches
- Initiating ministries to new neighborhoods or people groups

### Q7: Can women function in apostolic ministry?

**Answer**: Absolutely. Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us" (Greek: *hekasto*)—literally, "to each and every person." All believers, across gender, race, and status, fit somewhere within APEST. The New Testament itself speaks of Junia as an apostle (Romans 16:7), and church history shows many women functioning in apostolic ministry.

The issue is not gender but gifting and calling. Women, like men, can be gifted apostolically and called to extend the gospel into new contexts. The church needs the full expression of all five APEST ministries from both men and women. Limiting apostolic ministry to men only removes half the church's apostolic capacity.

**Key Points**:
- APEST is given to all believers, regardless of gender
- New Testament speaks of Junia as apostle
- Church history shows many women in apostolic ministry
- Limiting to men removes half the church's capacity

**Examples**:
- Junia as apostle (Romans 16:7)
- Historical examples: Catherine Booth, Thérèse of Lisieux
- Contemporary women in church planting and movement initiation

### Q8: How does apostolic ministry relate to the other APEST ministries?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry works alongside the other four APEST ministries to create a symphony of missional engagement. It cannot function in isolation but needs the other ministries to be fully effective.

**With Prophetic Ministry**: Prophets help apostolic ministry stay true to the gospel and avoid drift. They challenge when apostolic extension compromises faithfulness. Apostolic ministry guided by prophetic faithfulness extends the gospel without losing its essence.

**With Evangelistic Ministry**: Evangelists extend the gospel message that apostolic ministry initiates. They recruit people to the movement that apostles start. Apostolic initiation supported by evangelistic recruitment creates movements that multiply.

**With Shepherding Ministry**: Shepherds care for the communities that apostolic ministry plants. They provide the relational foundation for apostolic extension. Apostolic planting sustained by shepherding care creates healthy, multiplying communities.

**With Teaching Ministry**: Teachers provide the theological foundation and wisdom for apostolic ministry. They help apostolic ministry stay grounded in Scripture and tradition. Apostolic movement grounded by teaching wisdom creates movements that are both missional and theologically sound.

**Key Points**:
- Apostolic ministry needs other APEST ministries to be fully effective
- Each ministry brings essential contribution to apostolic work
- Together they create symphony of missional engagement
- Integration is essential for movement health

**Examples**:
- Early church functioning with all five ministries (Acts)
- John Wesley exemplifying all five capacities
- Contemporary movements integrating all five functions

### Q9: What is the difference between apostolic ministry and church planting?

**Answer**: Church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, but apostolic ministry is broader than church planting. Apostolic ministry involves extending the gospel into new contexts, creating systems that multiply, and building networks that sustain movement health. Church planting is one way this happens, but not the only way.

Apostolic ministry can manifest in starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, creating training systems, or pioneering new work in any context. The key is the apostolic function: extending the gospel and multiplying disciples and communities.

Some church planters are not particularly apostolic—they may be more evangelistic or shepherding in their gifting. Some apostolic people are not church planters—they may be building networks, creating systems, or initiating movements in other ways.

**Key Points**:
- Church planting is one expression, not the definition
- Apostolic ministry is broader than church planting
- Some planters are not apostolic; some apostolic people don't plant
- Focus on function: extending gospel and multiplying

**Examples**:
- Building networks that connect churches
- Creating training systems that multiply leaders
- Initiating ministries to specific communities
- Starting missional communities within existing churches

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2, 3

### Q10: How do we avoid hierarchical distortions of apostolic ministry?

**Answer**: The key is to ground apostolic ministry in Jesus' model of servant leadership and to recognize that it is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a subset of leaders. Apostolic ministry is about sentness and multiplication, not about power or hierarchy.

We avoid hierarchical distortions by:
1. **Remembering Jesus' model**: Jesus washed feet and said the greatest is the servant (Luke 22:24–26). Apostolic ministry must follow this pattern.
2. **Recognizing it's for all**: Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us." Apostolic ministry is not just for leaders but for the entire Body.
3. **Focusing on function, not office**: Apostolic ministry is a function, not a hierarchical office. It's about what you do, not your position.
4. **Building accountability**: Apostolic ministry needs the other APEST ministries to provide accountability and balance.
5. **Emphasizing multiplication, not control**: Apostolic ministry multiplies, it doesn't control. It extends the gospel, it doesn't consolidate power.

**Key Points**:
- Ground in Jesus' servant leadership model
- Recognize it's for entire Body, not just leaders
- Focus on function, not office
- Build accountability through other APEST ministries
- Emphasize multiplication, not control

**Examples**:
- Jesus washing feet (John 13)
- Early church sending from within community (Acts 13:1–3)
- APEST as ministry for all, not leadership for few

**Related Concepts**: APEST Framework, Jesus is Lord

### Q11: What is apostolic intelligence (AQ)?

**Answer**: Apostolic intelligence (AQ) is the distinct capacity that apostolic ministry brings to the church. It involves several key abilities: pioneering new work, architecting systems that multiply, building translocal connections, and initiating movements that transform communities.

Apostolic intelligence is not just about IQ or skills. It's about a way of thinking and operating that focuses on extension, multiplication, and movement. People with high AQ think in terms of multiplication rather than expansion. They build systems that can be replicated. They create networks that connect people and resources. They pioneer new work, often with limited resources and significant risk.

Apostolic intelligence is essential for the church to fulfill its mission. Without it, churches become static institutions focused on maintenance. With it, churches become movements that multiply and extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.

**Key Points**:
- Distinct capacity for extension, multiplication, and movement
- Involves pioneering, system architecture, networking, movement initiation
- Way of thinking focused on multiplication, not expansion
- Essential for church to fulfill mission

**Examples**:
- Thinking in terms of multiplication
- Building replicable systems
- Creating translocal networks
- Pioneering with limited resources

### Q12: How does apostolic ministry relate to the Great Commission?

**Answer**: The Great Commission is fundamentally apostolic: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). The church is sent into the world, just as Jesus was sent by the Father. Apostolic ministry is the means by which the church fulfills this commission.

The Great Commission involves going (apostolic), making disciples (all APEST functions), baptizing (incorporating into community), and teaching (teaching ministry). Apostolic ministry provides the "going" dimension—the sentness that extends the gospel into new contexts.

Without apostolic ministry, the Great Commission becomes a gathering commission rather than a sending commission. Churches focus on attracting people rather than sending people. Apostolic ministry restores the sending dimension, ensuring that the church extends the gospel to the ends of the earth.

**Key Points**:
- Great Commission is fundamentally apostolic
- Involves going, making disciples, baptizing, teaching
- Apostolic ministry provides the "going" dimension
- Without it, commission becomes gathering rather than sending

**Examples**:
- Early church extending from Jerusalem (Acts 1:8)
- Missionary movements throughout history
- Contemporary church planting and mission

**Related Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

---

### Q13: What happens when apostolic ministry is absent?

**Answer**: When apostolic ministry is absent, churches become static institutions focused on maintenance rather than mission. They may grow numerically, but they do not multiply. They may expand, but they do not extend into new contexts. The result is predictable: churches that are healthy internally but ineffective missionally.

The church's decline in the West can be traced, in part, to the exile of apostolic ministry. When churches operate with only shepherd-teacher functions, they are perfectly designed for maintenance and stability. They are not designed for multiplication and movement.

Without apostolic ministry, churches lose their sentness. They become gathering places rather than sending communities. They focus on attracting people rather than sending people. They maintain existing systems rather than creating new ones that multiply.

**Key Points**:
- Churches become static institutions focused on maintenance
- They grow but don't multiply, expand but don't extend
- Lose sentness, become gathering places
- Focus on attracting rather than sending

**Examples**:
- Churches that grow but don't multiply
- Focus on maintaining existing systems
- Lack of extension into new contexts
- Decline in missional effectiveness

### Q14: How does apostolic ministry function as custodian of missional DNA?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that essential elements of missional movement are preserved and passed on to new communities. This includes Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality-communitas.

As custodian, apostolic ministry guards against drift toward institutional maintenance. It keeps the movement focused on mission and multiplication. It ensures that new communities are birthed with the full DNA of missional movement.

This custodianship happens through creating systems that multiply, building networks that sustain movement health, and training leaders who carry the DNA forward. Apostolic ministry ensures that the movement doesn't lose its essence as it multiplies.

**Key Points**:
- Preserves and passes on essential elements of missional movement
- Guards against drift toward institutional maintenance
- Ensures new communities birthed with full DNA
- Creates systems, networks, and training that carry DNA forward

**Examples**:
- Training systems that multiply leaders with DNA
- Networks that sustain movement health
- Systems that ensure multiplication maintains essence
- Guarding against institutional drift

### Q15: What is the relationship between apostolic ministry and translocal networking?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry builds connections beyond the local church, creating networks that link churches, ministries, and movements across regions and nations. These networks enable resource sharing, mutual support, and collaborative mission.

Translocal networking is essential for movement health. It prevents isolation, enables learning, and creates accountability. Apostolic ministry recognizes that no church or ministry can thrive in isolation; we need connections to the broader movement.

These networks are not hierarchical but relational. They connect apostolic leaders, share resources, provide mutual support, and enable collaborative mission. They extend the gospel beyond local contexts while maintaining local autonomy.

**Key Points**:
- Builds connections beyond local church
- Links churches, ministries, movements across regions
- Enables resource sharing, mutual support, collaborative mission
- Prevents isolation, enables learning, creates accountability

**Examples**:
- Church planting networks
- Missional movement networks
- Resource sharing partnerships
- Collaborative mission initiatives

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, APEST Framework

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2, 3

---

### Q16: How does apostolic ministry create systems that multiply?

**Answer**: Apostolic ministry creates systems that multiply rather than expand. This involves designing simple, reproducible patterns that can be replicated in any context. The focus is on multiplication—one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight.

This is different from expansion, which involves making existing systems larger. Multiplication creates new systems that reproduce. Apostolic ministry asks: "How do we design this so it can be replicated? How do we build DNA into this system so it multiplies?"

System architecture involves creating structures that support multiplication. This includes training systems, leadership development, network connections, and resource sharing. Apostolic ministry builds systems that enable others to extend the gospel.

**Key Points**:
- Designs simple, reproducible patterns
- Focuses on multiplication, not expansion
- Creates new systems that reproduce
- Builds DNA into systems so they multiply

**Examples**:
- Training systems that multiply leaders
- Church planting systems that reproduce
- Discipleship patterns that multiply
- Leadership development that extends

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2, 3; *The Forgotten Ways*

### Q17: What is the difference between "Big A" and "little a" apostles?

**Answer**: The "Big A" refers to the original twelve apostles who had a unique foundational role in church history. They were eyewitnesses to the resurrection, laid the foundation of the church, and wrote Scripture. Their role is unique and irreplaceable.

The "little a" refers to the ongoing apostolic function that continues as an essential gift to the church. This function—extending the gospel, creating systems that multiply, building networks—was bequeathed by the original apostles as the inheritance of the church.

We extract the "little a" from the "Big A," recognizing that all apostolic functions are rooted primarily in Jesus Himself. The original apostles had a unique role, but the apostolic function continues. We honor the "Big A" while recognizing that the "little a" is essential for the church's ongoing mission.

**Key Points**:
- "Big A" = original twelve with unique foundational role
- "little a" = ongoing apostolic function as essential gift
- Extract "little a" from "Big A"
- All apostolic functions rooted in Jesus

**Examples**:
- Original twelve as "Big A"
- Paul, Barnabas, others as "little a"
- Historical and contemporary apostolic figures
- All rooted in Jesus as exemplary apostle

**Related Concepts**: Historical Development, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

### Q18: How does apostolic ministry relate to the Nicene marks of the church?

**Answer**: The Nicene Creed identifies the church as "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic." Darrell Guder emphasizes that these marks should be interpreted in reverse order—apostolic, catholic, holy, and one—so that apostolicity defines every aspect of church life.

The church is, by its nature and calling, an apostolic body, sent into the world to witness to God's redemptive order. Apostolicity is not just one mark among four; it is the defining mark that shapes the others. The church is apostolic, and from that flows its catholicity, holiness, and unity.

Apostolic ministry ensures that the church remains apostolic. It keeps the church focused on mission and multiplication. It prevents the church from becoming a static institution and maintains its identity as a sent, missional community.

**Key Points**:
- Nicene marks: one, holy, catholic, apostolic
- Should be interpreted in reverse order
- Apostolicity defines every aspect of church life
- Apostolic ministry ensures church remains apostolic

**Examples**:
- Church as sent, missional community
- Apostolicity shaping catholicity, holiness, unity
- Mission defining church identity
- Sentness as core of church nature

**Related Concepts**: APEST Framework, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 9; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

### Q19: What is the relationship between apostolic ministry and church planting?

**Answer**: Church planting is one primary expression of apostolic ministry. When apostolic ministry functions well, it naturally leads to church planting as a means of extending the gospel into new contexts and multiplying disciples and communities.

However, church planting is not the only expression of apostolic ministry. Apostolic ministry can also manifest in starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, creating training systems, or pioneering new work in any context.

The key is the apostolic function: extending the gospel and multiplying disciples and communities. Church planting is one way this happens, but not the only way. Some apostolic people are church planters; others build networks, create systems, or initiate movements in different ways.

**Key Points**:
- Church planting is one primary expression
- Not the only expression of apostolic ministry
- Key is apostolic function, not specific activity
- Can manifest in various ways

**Examples**:
- Church planting as extension and multiplication
- Starting missional communities
- Building networks and systems
- Initiating movements in various contexts

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sources**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2, 3

### Q20: How do we develop apostolic ministry in our church?

**Answer**: Developing apostolic ministry begins with recognizing that it is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a subset of leaders. Every believer is sent, and some are particularly gifted apostolically. The first step is to identify and release those with apostolic gifting.

This involves creating space for apostolic ministry to function. It might mean sending people to start new communities, creating systems that multiply, building networks that extend impact, or initiating new ministries. The key is to shift from maintenance to mission, from expansion to multiplication.

Developing apostolic ministry also involves integrating it with the other APEST ministries. Apostolic ministry needs prophetic faithfulness, evangelistic recruitment, shepherding care, and teaching wisdom. Together they create a symphony of missional engagement.

Finally, developing apostolic ministry requires building systems that multiply. This includes training systems, leadership development, network connections, and resource sharing. The goal is to create a culture where apostolic ministry is recognized, released, and multiplied.

**Key Points**:
- Recognize it's for entire Body, not just leaders
- Identify and release those with apostolic gifting
- Create space for apostolic ministry to function
- Integrate with other APEST ministries
- Build systems that multiply

**Examples**:
- Identifying apostolic gifting in people
- Sending teams to start new communities
- Creating training systems that multiply
- Building networks that extend impact
