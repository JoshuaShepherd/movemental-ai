# Apostolic Ministry: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Apostolic Ministry  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for implementing apostolic ministry  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for developing and implementing apostolic ministry in your church or organization. Apostolic ministry is essential for the church to fulfill its mission of extending the gospel into new contexts and multiplying disciples and communities. Without it, churches become static institutions focused on maintenance rather than mission.

This guide covers assessment, step-by-step implementation, common pitfalls, success indicators, and case studies. It is designed for church leaders, practitioners, and anyone seeking to develop apostolic ministry in their context.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:
1. How is our church currently extending the gospel into new contexts?
2. Are we multiplying disciples and communities, or just expanding existing systems?
3. Do we have people with apostolic gifting who are being released to function?
4. Are we building systems that multiply, or systems that just get larger?
5. Do we have translocal networks that connect us to the broader movement?
6. Is our focus on mission and multiplication, or maintenance and stability?
7. How are we guarding and passing on our missional DNA?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: APEST Assessment

**Purpose**: Identifies APEST gifting in individuals and the church

**How to Use**: 
- Use 5Q assessment tools or similar
- Assess both individual gifting and corporate expression
- Identify gaps, especially in apostolic function

**Scoring**: Look for low scores in apostolic function, which indicates need for development

#### Tool 2: Multiplication Assessment

**Purpose**: Measures whether you're multiplying or just expanding

**How to Use**:
- Count new communities/churches started in past 2 years
- Count leaders trained and released
- Measure extension into new contexts
- Assess system reproducibility

**Scoring**: High multiplication = many new starts, leaders released, contexts reached. Low = few starts, leaders retained, same contexts.

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Leadership understands apostolic ministry and its importance
- [ ] Church has identified people with apostolic gifting
- [ ] Systems are in place to release apostolic ministry
- [ ] Focus is shifting from maintenance to mission
- [ ] Resources available for apostolic initiatives
- [ ] Accountability structures in place
- [ ] Integration with other APEST ministries planned

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing Apostolic with Hierarchical

**Description**: Treating apostolic ministry as hierarchical authority rather than sentness and multiplication

**Why It Happens**: Cultural assumptions about leadership, fear of power structures, misunderstanding of apostolic function

**How to Avoid**:
- Ground everything in Jesus' servant leadership model
- Emphasize function over office
- Build accountability through other APEST ministries
- Focus on multiplication, not control

**If You're Already There**: Return to Jesus' model, rebuild around function not office, create accountability structures

### Pitfall 2: Focusing Only on Church Planting

**Description**: Limiting apostolic ministry to church planting, missing other expressions

**Why It Happens**: Narrow understanding of apostolic ministry, cultural assumptions, limited vision

**How to Avoid**:
- Broaden understanding of apostolic function
- Recognize multiple expressions
- Create space for various apostolic initiatives
- Focus on function, not specific activity

**If You're Already There**: Expand vision, create space for other expressions, celebrate diverse apostolic work

### Pitfall 3: Neglecting Other APEST Ministries

**Description**: Focusing on apostolic to the exclusion of other ministries

**Why It Happens**: Enthusiasm for apostolic, reaction to previous neglect, lack of integration

**How to Avoid**:
- Regularly assess APEST balance
- Create spaces for all five to function
- Build integration into systems
- Recognize need for all five

**If You're Already There**: Reassess balance, create spaces for other ministries, build integration

### Pitfall 4: Expansion Instead of Multiplication

**Description**: Making existing systems larger rather than creating new systems that multiply

**Why It Happens**: Easier to expand than multiply, lack of multiplication focus, maintenance mindset

**How to Avoid**:
- Focus on multiplication metrics
- Design systems that reproduce
- Train leaders who can train others
- Measure multiplication, not expansion

**If You're Already There**: Shift focus to multiplication, redesign systems, retrain leaders
