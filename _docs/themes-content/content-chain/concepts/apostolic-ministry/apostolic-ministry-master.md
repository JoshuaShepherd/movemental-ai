## Executive Summary

Apostolic ministry is the sent, founding, extending ministry that lies at the heart of missional movement. The term "apostle" derives from the Greek verb *apostello*, meaning "to send"—an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender. Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God's eternal purposes (John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1). He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption.

Apostolic ministry extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks. It is the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that the movement multiplies rather than merely expands. When apostolic ministry functions well, churches become movements that transform neighborhoods and extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.

**Key Points**:
- Apostolic ministry is about sentness—being commissioned and empowered to extend the gospel into new contexts
- It functions as the custodian of missional DNA, ensuring multiplication and movement health
- Apostolic intelligence (AQ) involves pioneering, system architecture, translocal networking, and movement initiation
- Jesus is the exemplary apostle, and all apostolic ministry flows from his pattern
- The church has often exiled apostolic ministry, leading to institutional maintenance rather than missional movement
- Apostolic ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a select few leaders

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Apostolic ministry is the sent, founding, extending ministry that lies at the heart of missional movement. The term "apostle" derives from the Greek verb *apostello*, meaning "to send"—an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender. Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God's eternal purposes (see John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1). He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption. His apostolic dimension touches on the purpose and mission of God in the world.

Apostolic ministry functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA. It extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks. Apostolic intelligence (AQ) involves pioneering new work, architecting systems that multiply, building translocal connections, and initiating movements that transform communities.

The apostolic function is uniquely missional. While all five APEST ministries are essential, apostolic ministry has a particular focus on extension, multiplication, and movement initiation. It asks the question: "How do we extend the gospel into new contexts? How do we multiply disciples and communities? How do we build systems that reproduce rather than merely expand?"

Apostolic ministry operates at multiple levels. At the individual level, it involves being sent into one's neighborhood, workplace, or sphere of influence. At the community level, it involves planting new churches, starting new missional communities, or initiating new expressions of church. At the movement level, it involves building networks, creating systems that multiply, and sustaining the health of the broader movement.

### Common Misunderstandings

**Misunderstanding 1: Apostles are only the original twelve**

Many Christians believe that apostleship ended with the original twelve disciples. This cessationist view cannot account for the continual emergence of apostolic figures throughout church history—Patrick, Francis of Assisi, John Wesley, Catherine Booth, and countless others. The New Testament itself speaks of apostles beyond the twelve, including Paul, Barnabas, Andronicus, and Junia (Romans 16:7). The original apostles had a unique foundational role, but the apostolic function continues as an essential gift to the church.

**Misunderstanding 2: Apostolic ministry is about hierarchical authority**

Some interpret apostolic ministry through a hierarchical leadership paradigm, viewing apostles as those with special spiritual authority or power. This misappropriation subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus' leadership (see Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11). Apostolic ministry is about sentness and multiplication, not about power or hierarchy. It is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a subset of leaders.

**Misunderstanding 3: Apostolic ministry is only for church planters**

While church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, it is not the only expression. Apostolic ministry can manifest in starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, creating systems that multiply, or pioneering new work in any context. The key is not the specific activity but the apostolic function: extending the gospel into new ground and multiplying disciples and communities.

**Misunderstanding 4: Apostolic ministry is primarily about leadership**

Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us" (Greek: *hekasto*)—literally, "to each and every person." All believers, across gender, race, and status, fit somewhere within APEST. This is not primarily a leadership text, but a ministry text. Every believer is endowed with a gifting, and ministry is a calling distinct from leadership. Leadership is a calling within a calling—some are gifted apostolically, but not all are to lead.

### Why It Matters

Apostolic ministry matters because the church is designed to be a movement, not an institution. Movements multiply. Institutions maintain. When apostolic ministry is absent or suppressed, churches become static institutions focused on maintenance rather than mission. They may grow numerically, but they do not multiply. They may expand, but they do not extend into new contexts.

The church's decline in the West can be traced, in part, to the exile of apostolic ministry. When churches operate with only shepherd-teacher functions, they are perfectly designed for maintenance and stability. They are not designed for multiplication and movement. The result is predictable: churches that are healthy internally but ineffective missionally.

Apostolic ministry is essential for the church to fulfill its mission. The Great Commission is fundamentally apostolic: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). The church is sent into the world, just as Jesus was sent by the Father. Without apostolic ministry, the church loses its sentness and becomes a gathering place rather than a sending community.

### Biblical Foundations

**Ephesians 4:7–11** provides the foundational text for apostolic ministry:

> "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. This is why it says: 'When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.' ... So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

The verbs for "given" (*edothe*) in verses 7 and 11 are aorist indicatives—adamant and without ambiguity. All five ministries are given, once and for all, as a complete, constitutional unit. You cannot remove or diminish one without undermining the whole.

**John 20:21** establishes Jesus as the exemplary apostle:

> "Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.'"

Jesus was sent by the Father, and he sends his followers. This is the apostolic pattern: sentness flows from the Father through the Son to the church.

**Acts 13:1–3** shows apostolic ministry in action:

> "Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.' So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off."

This passage shows apostolic ministry as a function of the whole church, not just individual leaders. The church at Antioch recognized the apostolic calling and sent Barnabas and Saul.

**1 Corinthians 12:28** lists apostles first:

> "And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues."

The order matters. Apostles are listed first, indicating their foundational importance for the church's mission.

### Theological Framework

Apostolic ministry is rooted in the doctrine of the Trinity. The Father sends the Son, and the Son sends the Spirit and the church. This sending is not a one-time event but an ongoing pattern of missional engagement. The church participates in the *missio Dei*—the mission of God—through apostolic ministry.

Apostolic ministry is also rooted in the doctrine of the church. The church is apostolic by nature. The Nicene Creed identifies the church as "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic." Darrell Guder emphasizes that these marks should be interpreted in reverse order—apostolic, catholic, holy, and one—so that apostolicity defines every aspect of church life. The church is, by its nature and calling, an apostolic body, sent into the world to witness to God's redemptive order.

Apostolic ministry is Christological. Jesus is the exemplary apostle, and all apostolic ministry flows from his pattern. The church is the Body of Christ, and as such, it must reflect the apostolic dimension of Jesus' ministry. If we are the body of Christ, we should reflect these dimensions. Anything less than a fivefold ministry misrepresents Christ.

Apostolic ministry is pneumatological. The Holy Spirit empowers and directs apostolic ministry. In Acts, the Spirit sends apostles, guides their decisions, and empowers their mission. Apostolic ministry is not a human initiative but a Spirit-led movement.

### Historical Examples

**The Early Church (Acts)**

The book of Acts is essentially the story of apostolic ministry in action. The apostles extended the gospel from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth. They planted churches, built networks, and created systems that multiplied. The early church was fundamentally apostolic in its nature and practice.

**Patrick (5th century)**

Patrick was sent to Ireland as a missionary, extending the gospel into a new context. He planted churches, trained leaders, and built networks that multiplied. His apostolic ministry transformed Ireland and sent missionaries throughout Europe.

**Francis of Assisi (12th–13th century)**

Francis initiated a movement that multiplied rapidly throughout Europe. He created simple, reproducible patterns that could be replicated in any context. His apostolic ministry extended the gospel to the poor and marginalized, creating a movement that continues to this day.

**John Wesley (18th century)**

Wesley was a remarkable movement maker who exemplified high 5Q capacities. He was apostolic in his movement initiation, prophetic in his social advocacy, evangelistic in his preaching, shepherding in his care systems, and teaching in his discipleship. His apostolic ministry created a movement that transformed England and extended to America.

**Contemporary Examples**

Contemporary apostolic movements include church planting networks, missional communities, and movements that multiply disciples and communities. These movements share common characteristics: they extend into new contexts, create systems that multiply, build networks, and sustain movement health.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### Sentness and Commissioning

Apostolic ministry begins with sentness. Jesus was sent by the Father, and he sends his followers. This pattern of sending is fundamental to apostolic ministry. Sentness involves being commissioned, empowered, and directed by the Holy Spirit to extend the gospel into new contexts.

Sentness is not about geography alone. It is about being sent into any context where the gospel needs to be extended—neighborhoods, workplaces, social networks, or new communities. Apostolic ministry recognizes that every believer is sent, and some are particularly gifted to extend the gospel into new ground.

#### Pioneering and Movement Initiation

Apostolic ministry involves pioneering new work. This includes starting new churches, initiating new missional communities, or beginning new ministries. Pioneering requires courage, vision, and the ability to work with limited resources. Apostolic leaders are willing to step into unknown territory and trust God for provision and direction.

Movement initiation is about creating systems that multiply. Apostolic ministry does not just start one church or one ministry; it creates patterns that can be replicated. It builds DNA into new communities so they can multiply and extend the gospel further.

#### System Architecture and Multiplication

Apostolic ministry creates systems that multiply rather than expand. This involves designing simple, reproducible patterns that can be replicated in any context. The focus is on multiplication—one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight. This is different from expansion, which involves making existing systems larger.

System architecture involves creating structures that support multiplication. This includes training systems, leadership development, network connections, and resource sharing. Apostolic ministry builds systems that enable others to extend the gospel.

#### Translocal Networking

Apostolic ministry builds connections beyond the local church. It creates networks that link churches, ministries, and movements across regions and nations. These networks enable resource sharing, mutual support, and collaborative mission.

Translocal networking is essential for movement health. It prevents isolation, enables learning, and creates accountability. Apostolic ministry recognizes that no church or ministry can thrive in isolation; we need connections to the broader movement.

#### Custodian of Missional DNA

Apostolic ministry functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA. It ensures that the essential elements of missional movement are preserved and passed on to new communities. This includes Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and liminality-communitas.

As custodian, apostolic ministry guards against drift toward institutional maintenance. It keeps the movement focused on mission and multiplication. It ensures that new communities are birthed with the full DNA of missional movement.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Early Church in Acts

The book of Acts provides the foundational story of apostolic ministry. The apostles extended the gospel from Jerusalem to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth. They planted churches, built networks, and created systems that multiplied. The story of the church at Antioch sending Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13:1–3) shows apostolic ministry as a function of the whole church, not just individual leaders.

#### Patrick and the Celtic Mission

Patrick was sent to Ireland as a missionary, extending the gospel into a new context. He planted churches, trained leaders, and built networks that multiplied. His apostolic ministry transformed Ireland and sent missionaries throughout Europe. The Celtic mission exemplifies apostolic ministry that extends the gospel into new cultural contexts.

#### John Wesley and the Methodist Movement

Wesley was a remarkable movement maker who exemplified high 5Q capacities. He was apostolic in his movement initiation, creating systems that multiplied rapidly. His apostolic ministry created a movement that transformed England and extended to America. The Methodist movement shows how apostolic ministry can create movements that transform entire nations.

#### Contemporary Church Planting Movements

Contemporary church planting movements exemplify apostolic ministry in action. These movements extend the gospel into new contexts, create systems that multiply, and build networks that sustain movement health. They show that apostolic ministry is not just historical but contemporary and essential.

### Practical Applications

**Individual Level**: Every believer is sent into their neighborhood, workplace, or sphere of influence. Some are particularly gifted apostolically to extend the gospel into new contexts. This might involve starting a small group, initiating a ministry, or building relationships that lead to new expressions of church.

**Community Level**: Churches can function apostolically by planting new churches, starting new missional communities, or initiating new ministries. This involves creating systems that multiply and building networks that extend the gospel.

**Movement Level**: Apostolic ministry at the movement level involves building networks, creating systems that multiply, and sustaining the health of the broader movement. This includes training systems, leadership development, and resource sharing.

### Common Questions Addressed

- What is the difference between apostolic ministry and church planting?
- How does apostolic ministry relate to the original twelve apostles?
- Can women function in apostolic ministry?
- How do we identify apostolic gifting in people?
- What does apostolic ministry look like in established churches?
- How do we avoid hierarchical distortions of apostolic ministry?

### Misconceptions and Corrections

**Misconception**: Apostles are only the original twelve.  
**Correction**: The original apostles had a unique foundational role, but the apostolic function continues as an essential gift to the church. The New Testament itself speaks of apostles beyond the twelve.

**Misconception**: Apostolic ministry is about hierarchical authority.  
**Correction**: Apostolic ministry is about sentness and multiplication, not about power or hierarchy. It is given to the entire Body of Christ.

**Misconception**: Apostolic ministry is only for church planters.  
**Correction**: While church planting is one expression, apostolic ministry can manifest in many ways: starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, or pioneering new work in any context.

### Connections to Other Concepts

**APEST Framework**: Apostolic ministry is one of five essential ministries that must function together. It works alongside prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Apostolic ministry embodies the sentness of the church. It extends the gospel into new contexts through incarnational presence.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan's initial recognition of apostolic ministry came through *The Forgotten Ways*, where it was identified as part of the mDNA framework. The apostolic environment (APEST) was recognized as essential for missional movement, but the focus was on the framework as a whole rather than individual ministries.

### Refinements

*The Permanent Revolution* provided a comprehensive treatment of apostolic ministry, establishing it as constitutional and essential. The concept of apostolic intelligence (AQ) was developed, and the distinction between "Big A" (original apostles) and "little a" (ongoing apostolic function) was clarified.

*5Q* further refined the understanding by establishing Jesus as the exemplary apostle and showing how all apostolic ministry flows from his pattern. The book addressed common misunderstandings, including cessationism and hierarchical distortions.

### Current Understanding

Alan's current understanding emphasizes:
- Apostolic ministry as constitutional and essential, not optional
- The distinction between apostolic function and apostolic office
- Apostolic ministry as given to the entire Body of Christ, not just leaders
- The integration of apostolic ministry with other APEST ministries
- Apostolic ministry as custodian of missional DNA

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: Apostles ended with the original twelve

**Alan's Response**: The original apostles had a unique foundational role, but the apostolic function continues as an essential gift to the church. The New Testament itself speaks of apostles beyond the twelve, including Paul, Barnabas, Andronicus, and Junia (Romans 16:7). Church history shows the continual emergence of apostolic figures: Patrick, Francis, Wesley, and countless others. Cessationism cannot account for this historical reality.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapter 8

### Objection 2: Apostolic ministry leads to hierarchical abuse

**Alan's Response**: This objection confuses apostolic function with hierarchical office. Apostolic ministry is about sentness and multiplication, not about power or hierarchy. When apostolic ministry is distorted into hierarchical authority, it subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus' leadership (Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11). The solution is not to eliminate apostolic ministry but to restore it to its proper, servant-oriented form.

**Source**: *5Q*, Chapter 8; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

### Objection 3: We already have pastors and teachers; we don't need apostles

**Alan's Response**: Ephesians 4 makes clear that all five ministries are necessary for the church's maturity. Removing three of the five constitutional ministries (apostle, prophet, evangelist) is contrary to the text's intention and has repeatedly led to the church's frustration and ineffectiveness. A church with only shepherd-teacher functions is perfectly designed for maintenance but not for mission.

**Source**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

### Objection 4: Apostolic ministry is only for church planters

**Alan's Response**: While church planting is one expression of apostolic ministry, it is not the only expression. Apostolic ministry can manifest in starting new missional communities, initiating new ministries, building networks, creating systems that multiply, or pioneering new work in any context. The key is not the specific activity but the apostolic function: extending the gospel into new ground and multiplying disciples and communities.
