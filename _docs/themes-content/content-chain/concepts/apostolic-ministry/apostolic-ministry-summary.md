## Core Definition

Apostolic ministry is the sent, founding, extending ministry that lies at the heart of missional movement. The term "apostle" derives from the Greek verb *apostello*, meaning "to send"—an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender. Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God's eternal purposes (John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1). He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption. Apostolic ministry extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks. It functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that the movement multiplies rather than merely expands.

## Key Points

1. **Sentness and Commissioning**
   - Apostolic ministry begins with sentness. Jesus was sent by the Father, and he sends his followers. This pattern of sending is fundamental to apostolic ministry, involving being commissioned, empowered, and directed by the Holy Spirit to extend the gospel into new contexts.

2. **Pioneering and Movement Initiation**
   - Apostolic ministry involves pioneering new work—starting new churches, initiating new missional communities, or beginning new ministries. It creates systems that multiply, building DNA into new communities so they can multiply and extend the gospel further.

3. **System Architecture and Multiplication**
   - Apostolic ministry creates systems that multiply rather than expand. It designs simple, reproducible patterns that can be replicated in any context, focusing on multiplication—one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight.

4. **Translocal Networking**
   - Apostolic ministry builds connections beyond the local church, creating networks that link churches, ministries, and movements across regions and nations. These networks enable resource sharing, mutual support, and collaborative mission.

5. **Custodian of Missional DNA**
   - Apostolic ministry functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that essential elements of missional movement are preserved and passed on to new communities. It guards against drift toward institutional maintenance.

6. **Given to the Entire Body**
   - Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us"—all believers are endowed with APEST gifting. Apostolic ministry is not just for leaders but for the entire Body of Christ. Every believer is sent, and some are particularly gifted to extend the gospel into new ground.

7. **Constitutional and Essential**
   - Apostolic ministry is constitutional and essential, not optional or historical. The verbs for "given" in Ephesians 4:7–11 are aorist indicatives—adamant and without ambiguity. All five ministries are given as a complete, constitutional unit.

## Related Concepts

- **APEST Framework** (Tier 1): Apostolic ministry is one of five essential ministries that must function together. It works alongside prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching ministries to create a symphony of missional engagement.

- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** (Tier 2): Apostolic ministry embodies the sentness of the church. It extends the gospel into new contexts through incarnational presence, living among people rather than separate from them.

- **Organic Systems** (Tier 2): Apostolic ministry creates systems that multiply. It designs simple, reproducible patterns that can be replicated in any context, focusing on multiplication rather than expansion.

- **Jesus is Lord** (Tier 2): All apostolic ministry flows from Jesus as the exemplary apostle. He is the foundation and pattern for all apostolic ministry, and without this foundation, apostolic ministry becomes distorted.

- **Prophetic Ministry** (Tier 3): Works alongside apostolic ministry to maintain faithfulness and challenge the status quo. Prophets help apostolic ministry stay true to the gospel and avoid drift.

- **Evangelistic Ministry** (Tier 3): Extends the gospel message that apostolic ministry initiates. Evangelists recruit people to the movement that apostles start, creating the connection between apostolic initiation and evangelistic multiplication.
