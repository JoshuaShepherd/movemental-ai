**Target Audience**: Designers, content creators, visual communicators  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Concept Overview

Apostolic ministry is the sent, founding, extending ministry that lies at the heart of missional movement. It extends Christianity into new ground, sustains systemic health, mobilizes for movement, and maintains local and global networks. Apostolic ministry functions as the custodian of the church's missional DNA, ensuring that the movement multiplies rather than merely expands.

Key visual themes include: sentness (arrows, pathways, sending), multiplication (branching, networks, growth), extension (reaching out, expanding boundaries), and movement (flow, dynamism, transformation). The visual language should convey movement, multiplication, and extension rather than static structures or hierarchical pyramids.

## Visual Metaphors

### The Sending Arrow

**Description**: An arrow or pathway extending from a central point (Jesus/God) outward into new contexts. The arrow represents sentness—being commissioned and empowered to extend the gospel. Multiple arrows branching from the center show multiplication and extension into various contexts.

**Visual Elements**: 
- Central point (Jesus as exemplary apostle)
- Arrows extending outward in multiple directions
- Different contexts represented by different destinations
- Network lines connecting the arrows showing translocal connections
- Growth/multiplication shown by arrows branching into more arrows

**Use Cases**: Illustrating sentness, commissioning, extension into new contexts, multiplication

### The Multiplying Network

**Description**: A network diagram showing nodes (churches/communities) connected by lines (relationships/networks). The network grows outward, with new nodes appearing as the movement multiplies. The connections show translocal networking and resource sharing.

**Visual Elements**:
- Nodes representing churches/communities
- Lines connecting nodes showing relationships
- Growth shown by new nodes appearing
- Central hub showing apostolic function as connector
- Different node sizes showing different stages of development

**Use Cases**: Showing translocal networking, movement multiplication, system architecture, network building

### The Seed and Tree

**Description**: A seed planted that grows into a tree, with the tree producing more seeds that grow into more trees. This shows multiplication—one becomes many. The roots represent the missional DNA being passed on, and the branches show extension into new contexts.

**Visual Elements**:
- Seed representing initial apostolic work
- Tree growing from seed showing development
- New seeds falling and growing into new trees
- Roots showing missional DNA
- Branches extending showing multiplication

**Use Cases**: Illustrating multiplication, system reproduction, DNA transmission, organic growth

### The River Flowing

**Description**: A river flowing from a source, branching into multiple streams that extend into different areas. The river represents the movement, and the streams show extension into new contexts. The flow shows dynamism and movement rather than static structures.

**Visual Elements**:
- Source (Jesus/missional DNA)
- Main river flowing
- Streams branching off
- Different areas reached by different streams
- Flow direction showing movement and extension

**Use Cases**: Showing movement dynamics, extension into contexts, flow of gospel, multiplication

## Diagram Concepts

### Diagram Type 1: Apostolic Function Flow

**Purpose**: Shows how apostolic ministry functions from individual to movement levels

**Structure**:
- **Individual Level**: Person sent into neighborhood/workplace (small circle with arrow)
- **Community Level**: Community extending into new contexts (larger circle with multiple arrows)
- **Movement Level**: Network of communities multiplying (network diagram)
- **Connections**: Lines showing how each level connects and multiplies

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Vertical flow from individual at top to movement at bottom
- Or horizontal flow from left (individual) to right (movement)
- Use size and complexity to show progression

**Visual Style**: Clean, modern, with clear progression and connection lines

### Diagram Type 2: APEST Integration

**Purpose**: Shows how apostolic ministry integrates with other APEST ministries

**Structure**:
- **Center**: Apostolic ministry (A)
- **Surrounding**: Prophetic (P), Evangelistic (E), Shepherding (S), Teaching (T)
- **Connections**: Lines showing how each supports apostolic work
- **Labels**: Brief descriptions of how each integrates

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Central hub with surrounding nodes
- Or circular arrangement with apostolic at top
- Use color coding for different ministries

**Visual Style**: Integrated, harmonious, showing synergy

### Diagram Type 3: Multiplication vs. Expansion

**Purpose**: Contrasts multiplication (apostolic) with expansion (institutional)

**Structure**:
- **Left Side**: Expansion (single structure getting larger)
- **Right Side**: Multiplication (multiple structures appearing)
- **Labels**: Key differences between approaches
- **Arrows**: Showing direction of growth

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Side-by-side comparison
- Use different visual styles to show contrast
- Include key text explaining differences

**Visual Style**: Clear contrast, educational, showing the difference

## Process Flows

### Apostolic Ministry Process

**Steps**:
1. **Sentness**: Recognizing calling and being sent
2. **Pioneering**: Starting new work in new context
3. **System Building**: Creating reproducible patterns
4. **Multiplication**: Systems reproduce and multiply
5. **Networking**: Building translocal connections
6. **Custodianship**: Guarding missional DNA

**Visual Flow**: Circular or linear flow with each step clearly marked, arrows showing progression, feedback loops showing ongoing nature

**Decision Points**: 
- Discernment of calling
- Context selection
- System design choices
- Network building decisions

- **Multiplication vs. Expansion**: Apostolic multiplies; institutional expands
- **Movement vs. Maintenance**: Apostolic creates movement; institutional maintains
- **Sentness vs. Gathering**: Apostolic sends; institutional gathers

**Visual Format**: Side-by-side comparison table or contrasting diagrams

## Additional Notes

Apostolic ministry visualizations should always convey movement, multiplication, and extension rather than static structures. Avoid hierarchical pyramids or organizational charts that suggest power structures. Instead, use network diagrams, flow charts, and organic growth patterns that show multiplication and movement.

The visual language should be dynamic and engaging, showing the energy and pioneering spirit of apostolic ministry. Use arrows, pathways, and flow to show direction and movement. Use networks and connections to show relationships and multiplication.
