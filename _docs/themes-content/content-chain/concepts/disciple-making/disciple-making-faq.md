## Introduction

Disciple making stands as the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus, the Founder. This core practice is perhaps the next most critical element in the mDNA mix after Jesus is Lord, because it is the essential task of discipleship to embody the message and mission of Jesus. Yet in the Western church, we have by and large lost the art of disciple making.

This FAQ addresses the most common questions about what disciple making means, how it differs from common misunderstandings, why it matters for missional movement, and how to recover it in contemporary contexts. Each answer is drawn from Alan's corpus and written in his voice to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

## Questions

### Q1: What is the difference between discipleship and conversion?

**Answer**: Conversion and discipleship are related but distinct. Conversion is the initial turning to Christ—the moment of salvation when we receive Jesus as Lord and Savior. Discipleship is the ongoing process of becoming like Jesus—the comprehensive transformation that follows conversion and continues throughout our lives.

Conversion is the beginning, but discipleship is the journey. We are saved by grace through faith, but this salvation works itself out in discipleship. The Great Commission makes clear that disciple making involves both conversion (baptism) and formation (teaching to obey). We cannot stop at conversion; we must continue in discipleship.

For the follower of Jesus, discipleship must not be viewed as the first step toward a promising religious career. It is in itself the fulfillment of his or her destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way. Discipleship is not optional; it is essential to the nature of Christian faith itself.

**Key Points**:
- Conversion is the beginning; discipleship is the ongoing journey
- Discipleship involves both conversion and formation
- We never move beyond being a disciple on the way
- Discipleship is essential to the nature of Christian faith

**Examples**:
- The early church required rigorous examination before baptism, showing that conversion and discipleship were connected
- The Great Commission includes both baptism (conversion) and teaching to obey (discipleship)

### Q2: How do we raise the bar on discipleship without becoming legalistic?

**Answer**: Raising the bar on discipleship is not about creating rules and requirements, but about recovering the comprehensive nature of following Jesus. The goal is to "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple." This means making church simple enough that anyone can participate, but making discipleship demanding enough that it requires genuine commitment.

The key is to focus on relationship and transformation rather than rules and requirements. Discipleship is about becoming like Jesus through relationship, not about earning salvation through works. We are saved by grace through faith, but this salvation works itself out in comprehensive transformation.

Legalism happens when we focus on external compliance rather than internal transformation. Authentic discipleship focuses on the heart—on becoming like Jesus in character, priorities, values, and mission. It is about relationship with Jesus, not about following a set of rules.

**Key Points**:
- Focus on relationship and transformation, not rules and requirements
- Make church simple but discipleship demanding
- Avoid external compliance; focus on internal transformation
- Emphasize relationship with Jesus, not legalistic rule-keeping

**Examples**:
- Life Transformation Groups focus on relationship, accountability, and transformation, not rules
- DNA Groups emphasize growth and support, not legalistic requirements

### Q3: What does it mean to "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple"?

**Answer**: This phrase, coined by Neil Cole of Church Multiplication Associates, captures a key insight about movement dynamics. "Lowering the bar of how church is done" means making the experience of church so simple that just about anyone can do it. Church becomes accessible, reproducible, and easily transferable.

"Raising the bar of what it means to be a disciple" means making discipleship the central requirement for participation in Christian community. Discipleship is not an optional extra, but the essential practice. If the church is made up of people who have taken up their cross and follow Jesus at any cost, the result will be a movement that empowers the common Christian to do the uncommon works of God.

The problem with many contemporary churches is that we have done the opposite: we have made church complex and discipleship too easy. We have lowered the bar on discipleship while raising the bar on church participation. This creates consumer Christianity rather than missional movement.

**Key Points**:
- Make church simple, accessible, and reproducible
- Make discipleship the central requirement, not optional
- The result is a movement that empowers common Christians
- Avoid making church complex and discipleship easy

**Examples**:
- Church Multiplication Associates made church simple through organic systems while requiring all to be in Life Transformation Groups
- The early church was simple in structure but rigorous in discipleship requirements

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Jesus is Lord

### Q4: How do we resist consumerism in discipleship?

**Answer**: Consumerism is the major threat to authentic discipleship in the West. It offers identity, purpose, meaning, and community—all the things that religion offers. Advertisers have become the official priesthood of a new and all-pervasive religion, deliberately co-opting theological ideas and religious symbols to sell products.

To resist consumerism, we must recognize it as a competing religion. We must actively work against the consumerist mindset that treats faith as a product to be consumed rather than a life to be lived. This requires intentional practices that break the power of consumerism.

Practical steps include: holding a monthly "buy nothing day," sharing credit card statements for accountability, abstaining from non-essentials and redirecting funds to charity, and aligning vocation and career under the lordship of Jesus. We must develop practices that help us live counter-culturally in a consumerist world.

**Key Points**:
- Recognize consumerism as a competing religion
- Actively work against the consumerist mindset
- Develop intentional practices that break the power of consumerism
- Live counter-culturally in a consumerist world

**Examples**:
- Monthly "buy nothing day" to break consumerist patterns
- Financial accountability to resist consumerist values
- Vocational alignment under Jesus's lordship

### Q5: What are effective models for disciple making?

**Answer**: Effective models for disciple making are simple, reproducible, and comprehensive. Life Transformation Groups (LTGs) and DNA Groups are examples of simple, duplicable, disciple-making systems that have proven effective in movements.

Life Transformation Groups involve a staple of Bible reading, storytelling, personal accountability, and prayer. They are small (2-3 people, same gender) groups that meet weekly and multiply once they grow past three members. In the CMA movement, it is required that all who call themselves Christians be in an LTG, and not just in the initial phases of the Christian life.

DNA Groups stand for Discipleship, Nurture, and Accountability. Every community member is encouraged to join a DNA: a group of two to five people meeting regularly for discussion, support, and prayer. Accountability questions might include: Whom have you blessed this week? With whom have you eaten? Have you sensed any promptings from God?

The key to effective models is simplicity and reproducibility. They must be simple enough that anyone can do them, yet comprehensive enough that they result in transformation.

**Key Points**:
- Effective models are simple, reproducible, and comprehensive
- Life Transformation Groups provide a proven pattern
- DNA Groups offer another effective approach
- Simplicity and reproducibility are essential

**Examples**:
- Church Multiplication Associates grew to 500 churches using LTGs
- SmallBoatBigSea uses DNA Groups effectively

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Jesus is Lord

### Q6: How do we create a culture of discipleship?

**Answer**: Creating a culture of discipleship requires encouraging a significant portion of your community—such as one-quarter of your members—to meet regularly in small groups for prayer and accountability. When discipleship is expected of everyone, and when key people participate in discipleship practices, a community ethos emerges in which spiritual growth is seen as both normal and desirable.

This involves talking about and expecting growth. Word-of-mouth is a powerful agent of change; our environment is greatly influenced by our conversations. Teach about spiritual growth from the Scriptures. Speak about growth in everyday conversations. Provide tangible examples, and encourage sharing of personal growth stories.

Leaders must model spiritual growth. You cannot expect others to pursue a discipleship lifestyle that leaders do not demonstrate. As the saying goes, "Habits are more easily caught than taught." Set a baseline for discipleship that is higher than the minimum, create a leadership covenant, and hold one another accountable.

**Key Points**:
- Encourage significant portion of community to participate
- Talk about and expect growth regularly
- Leaders must model spiritual growth
- Create accountability structures

**Examples**:
- One-quarter of community in small groups creates critical mass
- Leadership covenant establishes baseline expectations
- Regular conversations about growth shape culture

### Q7: What is the role of coaching in discipleship?

**Answer**: Coaching is an intentional relationship where a coach helps the individual grow in Christlikeness through setting goals, reflection, and accountability. The process involves setting goals and evaluating progress, engaging in discipleship, reflecting with the coach on experiences, and the coach helping identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Good coaches listen actively, ask insightful questions, help clarify and celebrate goals, and challenge, train, and disciple holistically. Steve Ogne's Seven Habits for Great Coaching include: LISTEN for where God is working, CARE for personal needs, CELEBRATE what God is doing, STRATEGIZE for missional effectiveness, TRAIN in essential ministry skills, DISCIPLE the whole person, and CHALLENGE specifically.

Coaches may be from inside or outside the community. Make monthly coaching compulsory for leaders and stakeholders. Coaching is embedded in the disciple-making process, offering regular coaching for members—sometimes by external mentors.

**Key Points**:
- Coaching is an intentional relationship for growth in Christlikeness
- Good coaches listen, ask questions, and challenge holistically
- Coaching should be compulsory for leaders
- Coaching can be from inside or outside the community

**Examples**:
- TPC Coaching Ethos includes regular coaching questions
- Steve Ogne's Seven Habits provide a framework for coaching

### Q8: How does discipleship relate to mission?

**Answer**: Discipleship and mission are inseparable. We are sent as disciples who make disciples. Mission flows from discipleship, and discipleship is lived out in mission. The goal is not individual transformation for its own sake, but transformation that results in missional engagement.

Disciples live with a sense of mission. They understand that they are sent into the world to be salt and light, to embody the kingdom of God in their context. Discipleship is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. We follow Jesus's model: on-the-road, in the world—not just in formal religious settings.

The Great Commission makes clear that disciple making is the primary task, and this involves going into all the world. We make disciples as we go, and we go as disciples. There is no separation between being a disciple and being on mission.

**Key Points**:
- Discipleship and mission are inseparable
- We are sent as disciples who make disciples
- Mission flows from discipleship, and discipleship is lived out in mission
- There is no separation between being a disciple and being on mission

**Examples**:
- The early church's mission flowed from their discipleship
- Contemporary missional movements integrate discipleship and mission

**Related Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Disciplism

### Q9: Why is disciple making considered so critical to missional movement?

**Answer**: Disciple making is considered so critical because it is the single most crucial factor that will determine the quality of the whole. If we fail on this point, then we must fail in all the others. In fact, if we fail here, it is unlikely that we will even get to any of the other elements of mDNA in any meaningful and lasting way.

Missional movements appear to the observer simply as disciple-making systems. They never appear to get beyond disciple making as a core practice because discipleship is at once the starting point, the abiding strategic practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact. Without meaningful discipleship, there can be no real movement and therefore no significant impact for the gospel.

The health and growth of transformative Jesus movements are directly related to their capacity to make disciples. No disciples, no movement—it's that simple. Whether one looks at the Wesleyan, the Franciscan, or the Chinese phenomenon, at core they are essentially composed of, and led by, disciples, and they are absolutely clear about the disciple-making mandate.

**Key Points**:
- Disciple making is the single most crucial factor
- Missional movements are essentially disciple-making systems
- Without meaningful discipleship, there can be no real movement
- The health and growth of movements are directly related to disciple-making capacity

**Examples**:
- The Wesleyan movement's success was tied to high commitment discipleship
- Church Multiplication Associates grew through resolute commitment to discipleship

**Related Concepts**: mDNA, Jesus is Lord, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

### Q10: What happened to Methodism when they moved away from discipleship?

**Answer**: Methodism in America had experienced massive exponential growth (35 percent of the population in around forty years), but two critical "movement killers" were introduced that effectively hamstrung the movement. In 1850, the leaders of Methodism had tired of the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians deriding them as "uncouth and unlearned" ministers, so they decided that all their circuit riders and local ministers had to complete four years of ordination studies in order to qualify. Growth ceased straightaway!

Ten years later (1860) they no longer required classes and bands—discipleship had become an optional extra. Methodism has been in decline in relation to percentage of the population ever since! This demonstrates the critical importance of discipleship to movement health and growth.

The key to Methodism's success was the high level of commitment expected of participants. This cause declined to the degree that the movement had moved away from its original missional ethos of evangelism and disciple making and degenerated into mere religious legalism maintained by institution, rule books, and highly professionalized clergy.

**Key Points**:
- Methodism grew to 35% of population through high commitment discipleship
- Requiring ordination studies stopped growth immediately
- Making discipleship optional led to decline
- This demonstrates the critical importance of discipleship

**Examples**:
- Growth ceased when ordination studies were required
- Decline began when classes and bands became optional

### Q11: How does discipleship differ from just learning about Jesus?

**Answer**: Discipleship differs fundamentally from just learning about Jesus. Learning about Jesus is intellectual assimilation of ideas—gaining information and knowledge. Discipleship is about transformation—becoming like Jesus through relationship and practice.

Discipleship involves following Jesus, learning from Jesus, being transformed by Jesus, multiplying disciples, and living missionally. It is not about information transfer, but about life transformation. We can know a lot about Jesus without being his disciple. True discipleship results in transformation—we become more like Jesus in character, in priorities, in values, and in mission.

The early church's catechisms were not merely doctrinal confessions; they involved rigorous personal examinations that required the catechumen to demonstrate why he or she was worthy of baptism. This shows that discipleship was about transformation, not just information.

**Key Points**:
- Learning about Jesus is information; discipleship is transformation
- Discipleship involves following, learning from, and being transformed by Jesus
- True discipleship results in becoming like Jesus
- The early church required demonstration of transformation, not just knowledge

**Examples**:
- The early church's rigorous examinations show transformation was required
- Contemporary movements focus on life change, not just information

**Related Concepts**: Metanoia, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5

### Q12: What is the relationship between discipleship and the priesthood of all believers?

**Answer**: The priesthood of all believers is the doctrine that every believer is a minister, empowered for mission. Movements that change the world are "people movements"—every believer as a minister, empowered for mission. This is rooted in the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.

Discipleship is about equipping God's people for service. As per Ephesians 4, discipleship is about equipping God's people for service. God has gifted every believer uniquely. People should be recognized as agents of the Kingdom from the moment they come to faith.

Empowerment is a core leadership function; Jesus modeled this by sending his disciples into active, meaningful service soon after calling them. Discipleship and the priesthood of all believers work together: discipleship equips people for ministry, and the priesthood of all believers recognizes that every believer is called to ministry.

**Key Points**:
- The priesthood of all believers means every believer is a minister
- Discipleship equips people for service
- Movements are "people movements" where every believer is empowered
- Discipleship and priesthood work together

**Examples**:
- Jesus sent his disciples into service soon after calling them
- Contemporary movements empower all believers for ministry

**Related Concepts**: Apostolic Environment, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

### Q13: How does action-reflection work in discipleship?

**Answer**: Action-reflection is the practice of blending action and reflection in discipleship. Discipleship is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Deuteronomy encourages forming faith through daily life rhythms. Follow Jesus's model: on-the-road, in the world—not just in formal religious settings.

Establish regular times to act, reflect, pray, and build theological frameworks together. Both formal and informal practices of action-reflection are essential. This means we learn by doing, and we reflect on what we've done to learn and grow.

The process involves acting in mission, reflecting on the experience, praying about what we've learned, and building theological frameworks that help us understand and apply what we've discovered. This creates a cycle of learning and growth that is grounded in real-life experience.

**Key Points**:
- Action-reflection blends action and reflection in discipleship
- Discipleship is forged in everyday life, not just formal settings
- Establish regular times to act, reflect, pray, and build frameworks
- Both formal and informal practices are essential

**Examples**:
- Jesus's disciples learned "on the road" by acting their way into new ways of thinking
- Contemporary movements use action-reflection cycles for growth

**Related Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Jesus is Lord

### Q14: Why did the early church require rigorous examination before baptism?

**Answer**: The early church required rigorous examination before baptism because they understood that discipleship was essential to the nature of Christian faith. By AD 170, the underground Christian movement had developed what it called the catechisms. These were not merely the doctrinal confessions they later became; they involved rigorous personal examinations that required the catechumen to demonstrate why he or she was worthy of baptism and entry into the confessing community.

Not only could proposed converts lose their life because of persecution, but they also had to prove why they believed they should be allowed to become part of the Christian community in the first place. Many were turned away because they were found unworthy. This is contrary to the "seeker-sensitive" practice so prevalent in our day.

It was this element of vigorous discipleship that characterized the early Christian movement, which was blighted by the deluge of worldliness that flooded the post-Constantinian church when the bar was lowered for membership and the culture was "Christianized."

**Key Points**:
- The early church understood discipleship was essential
- Rigorous examination ensured transformation, not just conversion
- Many were turned away because they were found unworthy
- This vigorous discipleship characterized the early movement

**Examples**:
- Catechisms required demonstration of worthiness
- Post-Constantinian church lowered the bar, leading to worldliness

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Metanoia

### Q15: How does discipleship relate to evangelism?

**Answer**: Discipleship and evangelism are inseparable. We make disciples, not just converts. The Great Commission makes clear that disciple making involves both conversion (baptism) and formation (teaching to obey). Evangelism happens within the broader framework of comprehensive discipleship.

This is the insight behind "disciplism"—reimagining evangelism through the lens of discipleship. Evangelism is not a separate activity from discipleship, but an integral part of it. We evangelize as we make disciples, and we make disciples as we evangelize.

The goal is not just to get people to make a decision, but to help them become disciples. This means evangelism is not just about initial conversion, but about ongoing formation. We invite people into a way of life, not just a one-time decision.

**Key Points**:
- Discipleship and evangelism are inseparable
- We make disciples, not just converts
- Evangelism happens within the framework of discipleship
- The goal is ongoing formation, not just initial conversion

**Examples**:
- The Great Commission includes both baptism and teaching to obey
- Disciplism reimagines evangelism through the lens of discipleship

**Related Concepts**: Disciplism, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5; *Disciplism*

### Q16: What is the difference between discipleship programs and disciple making?

**Answer**: Discipleship programs are structured curricula or courses designed to teach about discipleship. Disciple making is the actual practice of forming people into the image of Christ through life-on-life relationships. Programs can support disciple making, but they cannot replace it.

Disciple making is not about programs, but about life-on-life relationships. It is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Programs can provide content and structure, but true discipleship happens in relationship—following Jesus, learning from Jesus, being transformed by Jesus.

The danger is when programs become a substitute for relationship. We can complete a program without being transformed. True disciple making requires relationship, accountability, and ongoing formation. Programs are tools that can support this, but they are not the thing itself.

**Key Points**:
- Programs are structured curricula; disciple making is life-on-life relationships
- Programs can support but cannot replace disciple making
- True discipleship happens in relationship, not just in programs
- Programs are tools, not the thing itself

**Examples**:
- Life Transformation Groups are simple relational patterns, not complex programs
- DNA Groups focus on relationship and accountability, not curriculum

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 3

### Q17: How do we know if discipleship is working?

**Answer**: We know discipleship is working when we see transformation—people becoming more like Jesus in character, priorities, values, and mission. This transformation manifests itself in several ways: people are following Jesus more closely, learning from Jesus more deeply, being transformed by Jesus more comprehensively, multiplying disciples more naturally, and living missionally more intentionally.

Evidence of transformation includes: increased love for God and others, greater commitment to mission, willingness to sacrifice for the gospel, multiplication of disciples, and missional engagement in the world. When discipleship is working, we see people who are becoming who they were created to be—people who do the good works God prepared for them.

The early church's rigorous examinations provide a model: they required demonstration of transformation, not just knowledge. Contemporary movements look for evidence of life change, not just information transfer.

**Key Points**:
- Discipleship is working when we see transformation
- Transformation manifests in character, priorities, values, and mission
- Evidence includes love, commitment, sacrifice, multiplication, and mission
- Look for life change, not just information transfer

**Examples**:
- The early church required demonstration of transformation
- Contemporary movements measure life change, not just attendance

**Related Concepts**: Metanoia, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5

### Q18: What role does community play in discipleship?

**Answer**: Community is essential to discipleship. Spiritual growth and Christlikeness are inseparable from participation in community. Love for one another is a spiritual discipline and a core witness. Discipleship happens in the context of community, not in isolation.

The early church understood this. They required rigorous examination before entry into the confessing community. Discipleship was not an individual pursuit, but a communal practice. Contemporary movements like Soma Communities require everyone to commit to common practices laced throughout the various missional communities.

Community provides accountability, support, encouragement, and challenge. It is in community that we learn to love, to serve, to forgive, to bear with one another. Discipleship without community is incomplete.

**Key Points**:
- Community is essential to discipleship
- Spiritual growth is inseparable from participation in community
- Community provides accountability, support, and challenge
- Discipleship without community is incomplete

**Examples**:
- The early church required entry into community
- Contemporary movements emphasize communal practices

**Related Concepts**: Liminality-Communitas, Apostolic Environment

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 3

### Q19: How does discipleship relate to leadership development?

**Answer**: Discipleship and leadership development are inseparable. Leadership is an extension of discipleship: its aim is Christlikeness. Focus on character, not merely ability. Build leadership development on healthy disciple-making processes.

In movements like NewThing Network, a person can become a leader only by being apprenticed and by apprenticing others in return. Leadership development is built on discipleship, not separate from it. The quality of leadership depends on the quality of discipleship.

Study and discuss Jesus's model of leadership. Develop a list of leadership qualities based on Jesus, and use it for regular self-evaluation. Leadership development is discipleship development—becoming more like Jesus in leadership.

**Key Points**:
- Leadership is an extension of discipleship
- Focus on character, not merely ability
- Build leadership development on disciple-making processes
- Leadership development is discipleship development

**Examples**:
- NewThing Network requires apprenticeship for leadership
- Jesus's model of leadership is the foundation

**Related Concepts**: Apostolic Environment, Jesus is Lord

### Q20: What is the "great omission" in contemporary Christianity?

**Answer**: Dallas Willard called our systematic failure to disciple "the great omission" in his book by that name. While we have the Great Commission to make disciples, we have largely omitted this task in contemporary Western Christianity. We have focused on conversion, programs, and activities, but we have failed to make disciples.

This omission has devastating consequences. If we fail in discipleship and disciple making, we fail in the primary mission of the church. The gospel cannot be limited to being about personal healing and wholeness, but rather extends in and through our salvation to the salvation of the world. To fail in discipleship is therefore to fail in the primary mission of the church.

The challenge is to recover the art of disciple making. We must raise the bar on discipleship while simplifying church. We must make discipleship the central requirement, not an optional extra. We must recover the simple yet profound practice of making disciples who make disciples.

**Key Points**:
- The "great omission" is our failure to make disciples
- This failure has devastating consequences for mission
- We must recover the art of disciple making
- Make discipleship the central requirement, not optional

**Examples**:
- Many churches focus on conversion but not formation
- Contemporary movements are recovering disciple making
