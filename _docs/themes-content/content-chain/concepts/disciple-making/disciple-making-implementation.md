# Disciple Making: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Disciple Making  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for recovering and implementing disciple making in community life  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers, missional communities  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for recovering and implementing disciple making as the essential practice of forming people into the image of Christ. Disciple making is not a program to implement but a way of life to recover—the core practice that embodies the message and mission of Jesus. This guide walks through the process of raising the bar on discipleship while simplifying church, creating a culture of discipleship, and establishing reproducible patterns for disciple making.

Whether you are starting a new missional community or seeking to renew an existing one, this guide offers concrete steps for making disciple making the central practice. The process involves assessment, culture creation, model implementation, and multiplication. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive approach to recovering this essential practice.

This guide is designed for communities that are serious about becoming disciple-making movements. It requires commitment, courage, and a willingness to let go of anything that competes with disciple making. The reward is the transformative power that comes when disciple making is the central practice—the same power that transformed the early church, the Wesleyan movement, and contemporary movements like Church Multiplication Associates.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **Is disciple making the central practice of your community?**
   - Is discipleship expected of everyone, or is it optional?
   - Do you have clear processes for making disciples?
   - Is transformation evident in your community?

2. **What is the relationship between church complexity and discipleship demands?**
   - Is church simple or complex?
   - Is discipleship easy or demanding?
   - Are you doing the opposite of what movements do?

3. **How is consumerism affecting your discipleship?**
   - Is faith treated as a product to be consumed?
   - Are there competing "lords" that undermine discipleship?
   - What practices resist consumerism?

4. **What models are you using for disciple making?**
   - Are they simple and reproducible?
   - Do they focus on relationship or programs?
   - Are they required or optional?

5. **Is there evidence of multiplication?**
   - Are disciples making other disciples?
   - Is there organic growth and expansion?
   - Is the movement multiplying?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: The Disciple-Making Inventory

**Purpose**: Assess the current state of disciple making in your community

**How to Use**:
1. Evaluate each aspect of disciple making (following, learning, transforming, multiplying, mission)
2. Rate on a scale of 1-5 how well each is happening
3. Identify areas scoring 3 or below as needing attention
4. Develop specific action plans for each area

**Scoring**:
- 5 = Excellent disciple making
- 4 = Good disciple making
- 3 = Adequate disciple making
- 2 = Poor disciple making
- 1 = No disciple making

#### Tool 2: The Bar Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate the relationship between church complexity and discipleship demands

**How to Use**:
1. Rate church complexity on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very simple, 5 = very complex)
2. Rate discipleship demands on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very easy, 5 = very demanding)
3. Identify if you're doing the opposite of what movements do
4. Develop plan to lower church bar and raise discipleship bar

**Scoring**: Movements typically have low church complexity (1-2) and high discipleship demands (4-5)

#### Tool 3: The Multiplication Test

**Purpose**: Assess if discipleship is resulting in multiplication

**How to Use**:
1. Count how many disciples are making other disciples
2. Track multiplication patterns over time
3. Identify barriers to multiplication
4. Develop strategies to increase multiplication

**Scoring**: Healthy movements show clear multiplication patterns

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Making It a Program

**Description**: Turning disciple making into a program or curriculum rather than a way of life

**Why It Happens**: Desire for structure, familiarity with programmatic approaches, misunderstanding of disciple making

**How to Avoid**:
- Emphasize relationship over curriculum
- Focus on life-on-life, not information transfer
- Keep models simple and relational
- Avoid complex programs

**If You're Already There**: Return to simple, relational models. Focus on relationship, not curriculum.

### Pitfall 2: Making It Optional

**Description**: Treating disciple making as optional rather than essential

**Why It Happens**: Fear of losing people, desire to be seeker-friendly, misunderstanding of discipleship

**How to Avoid**:
- Make disciple making required for all
- Communicate expectations clearly
- Provide support for participation
- Resist the temptation to make it optional

**If You're Already There**: Make it required. Communicate clearly that discipleship is essential, not optional.

### Pitfall 3: Lowering the Bar

**Description**: Making discipleship too easy, requiring little commitment

**Why It Happens**: Fear of demanding too much, desire to attract people, consumerist mindset

**How to Avoid**:
- Raise the bar on what it means to be a disciple
- Require genuine commitment
- Resist consumerist pressures
- Focus on transformation, not attendance

**If You're Already There**: Raise expectations. Make discipleship demanding while keeping church simple.

### Pitfall 4: Focusing on Information

**Description**: Reducing discipleship to information transfer rather than transformation

**Why It Happens**: Familiarity with educational models, ease of information transfer, misunderstanding of transformation

**How to Avoid**:
- Focus on transformation, not information
- Emphasize relationship and practice
- Use action-reflection cycles
- Measure life change, not knowledge

**If You're Already There**: Shift from information to transformation. Focus on relationship and practice.

### Pitfall 5: Neglecting Multiplication

**Description**: Focusing on making disciples but not on multiplication

**Why It Happens**: Comfort with current size, fear of multiplication, lack of multiplication training

**How to Avoid**:
- Build multiplication into the model
- Train groups in multiplication
