## Executive Summary

Disciple making stands as the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus, the Founder. This core practice is perhaps the next most critical element in the mDNA mix after Jesus is Lord, because it is the essential task of discipleship to embody the message and mission of Jesus. At its core, discipleship is about becoming like Jesus—transformation that comes from walking closely with Jesus and allowing his Spirit to shape us into his image.

Missional movements appear to the observer simply as disciple-making systems. They never appear to get beyond disciple making as a core practice because discipleship is at once the starting point, the abiding strategic practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact. When we deal with discipleship and the related capacity to generate authentic followers of Jesus, we are dealing with that single most crucial factor that will in the end determine the quality of the whole.

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Disciple making is the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus, the Founder. It is the core practice of forming people into the image of Christ through life-on-life relationships, intentional formation, and comprehensive transformation. At its core, discipleship is about becoming like Jesus—not merely intellectual assent to theological propositions, but transformation that comes from walking closely with Jesus and allowing his Spirit to shape us into his image.

Authentic discipleship involves following Jesus, learning from Jesus, being transformed by Jesus, multiplying disciples, and living missionally. It is the essential task on which Jesus focused his efforts and invested most of his time and energy. He took very seriously the selection and development of that motley band of followers on whose feeble and trembling shoulders he lay the entire redemptive movement that would emerge from his death and resurrection.

Missional movements appear to the observer simply as disciple-making systems. They never appear to get beyond disciple making as a core practice because discipleship is at once the starting point, the abiding strategic practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact. Whether one looks at the Wesleyan, the Franciscan, or the Chinese phenomenon, at core they are essentially composed of, and led by, disciples, and they are absolutely clear about the disciple-making mandate.

### Common Misunderstandings

Many contemporary Christians misunderstand discipleship as merely the first step toward a promising religious career, or as something we do with young converts that becomes an optional extra later. Others reduce it to the intellectual assimilation of ideas—learning about Jesus rather than learning from Jesus. Some treat it as a program or curriculum rather than a way of life.

The biblical understanding of discipleship is far more radical. It is not a stepping stone to something else, but the fulfillment of our destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way. It is not about information transfer, but about transformation. It is not about programs, but about life-on-life relationships. It is not optional, but essential to the nature of Christian faith itself.

### Why It Matters

Disciple making matters because it is the single most crucial factor that will determine the quality of the whole. If we fail on this point, then we must fail in all the others. In fact, if we fail here, it is unlikely that we will even get to any of the other elements of mDNA in any meaningful and lasting way.

It matters because discipleship is the very task on which Jesus focused his efforts. He invested most of his time and energy in making disciples. The founding of the whole Christian movement was initiated through the simple acts of Jesus investing his life and embedding his teachings in his followers and developing them into authentic disciples.

It matters because missional movements are essentially disciple-making systems. Without meaningful discipleship, there can be no real movement and therefore no significant impact for the gospel. The health and growth of transformative Jesus movements are directly related to their capacity to make disciples. No disciples, no movement—it's that simple.

### Biblical Foundations

The biblical foundation for disciple making begins with Jesus's call to his first disciples: "Follow me" (Matthew 4:19, Mark 1:17, Luke 5:27). This call was not merely an invitation to believe, but to follow—to become like the one being followed. Jesus invested three years of his life in these twelve men, living with them, teaching them, showing them the way.

The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) establishes disciple making as the primary task of the church: "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." This commission makes clear that disciple making involves both conversion (baptism) and formation (teaching to obey).

The New Testament consistently presents discipleship as comprehensive transformation. Paul writes, "We are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do" (Ephesians 2:10). Discipleship is about becoming who we were created to be—people who do the good works God prepared for us.

### Theological Framework

Disciple making fits into the broader theological framework of sanctification, transformation, and mission. It represents the intersection of soteriology, ecclesiology, and missiology—how we are saved, how we are formed, and how we are sent.

From a soteriological perspective, discipleship is the ongoing work of salvation. We are saved by grace through faith, but this salvation works itself out in comprehensive transformation. Discipleship is the process by which we become who we are in Christ.

From an ecclesiological perspective, discipleship is the primary task of the church. The church exists to draw people to Christ and make them like Christ. If the church is not doing this, then all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible, are a waste of time.

From a missiological perspective, discipleship is the foundation for mission. We are sent into the world as disciples who make disciples. Mission flows from discipleship, and discipleship is lived out in mission.

### Historical Examples

The early church provides the primary historical example of disciple making in action. By AD 170, the underground Christian movement had developed rigorous personal examinations called catechisms that required the catechumen to demonstrate why he or she was worthy of baptism and entry into the confessing community. Many were turned away because they were found unworthy. This vigorous discipleship characterized the early Christian movement.

The Wesleyan movement offers another example. John Wesley began to travel throughout Great Britain with a vision for the conversion and discipling of a nation. Within a generation, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist. The key to Methodism's success was the high level of commitment expected of participants. The movement declined when discipleship became an optional extra.

Church Multiplication Associates (CMA) provides a contemporary example. Neil Cole developed Life Transformation Groups (LTGs), a simple, duplicable, disciple-making system. The key to their remarkable growth to five hundred churches was their resolute commitment to discipleship: "We want to lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple."

### Evolution of Thought

Alan's thinking on disciple making has developed from initial recognition of its importance in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006) to comprehensive treatment in *Untamed* (2010) with Debra Hirsch, addressing obstacles to discipleship in theology, culture, and personal issues. In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), he provided practical habits and practices. In *Disciplism* (2019), he connected evangelism to comprehensive discipleship.

The concept has been refined to emphasize its strategic nature—it is perhaps the next most critical element after Jesus is Lord. The challenge of consumerism has been increasingly emphasized as the major threat to authentic discipleship in the West. The connection to movement dynamics has been strengthened, showing how disciple making is essential for missional impact.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### The Essence of Discipleship

At its core, discipleship is about becoming like Jesus. It is about embodying his message and mission in our daily lives. This is not about intellectual assent to theological propositions, though that has its place. It is about transformation—the kind of transformation that comes from walking closely with Jesus and allowing his Spirit to shape us into his image.

Authentic discipleship involves several key elements: following Jesus, learning from Jesus, being transformed by Jesus, multiplying disciples, and living missionally. Each element is essential, and together they create comprehensive discipleship that affects every aspect of life.

#### The Challenge of Consumerism

For Christians who live in the Western world, the major challenge to the viability of Christianity is consumerism. It is a far more serious and insidious challenge to the gospel than other religions or worldviews, because in so many ways it infects each and every one of us. Consumerism offers identity, purpose, meaning, and community—all the things that religion offers. Advertisers have become the official priesthood of a new and all-pervasive religion, deliberately co-opting theological ideas and religious symbols to sell products.

We must find a way to deal with consumerism if we are going to be effective witnesses for the way of Jesus in the twenty-first century. This requires active resistance to the consumerist mindset that treats faith as a product to be consumed rather than a life to be lived.

#### Raising the Bar on Discipleship

The challenge for the Western church is to recover authentic discipleship in the face of consumerism and institutional Christianity. We must raise the bar—make discipleship the central requirement for participation in Christian community, not an optional extra. We must simplify church—make it simple enough that anyone can participate, but demanding enough that it requires genuine commitment.

The goal is to "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple." If the experience of church is so simple that just about anyone can do it, and the church is made up of people who have taken up their cross and follow Jesus at any cost, the result will be a movement that empowers the common Christian to do the uncommon works of God.

#### Life Transformation Groups (LTGs)

Life Transformation Groups are a simple, duplicable, disciple-making system developed by Neil Cole of Church Multiplication Associates. An LTG simply involves a staple of Bible reading, storytelling, personal accountability, and prayer. In the CMA movement, it is required that all who call themselves Christians be in an LTG, and not just in the initial phases of the Christian life. It is an ongoing commitment for all who are involved, including leadership at every level.

#### DNA Groups

DNA stands for Discipleship, Nurture, and Accountability. Every community member is encouraged to join a DNA: a group of two to five people meeting regularly for discussion, support, and prayer. Accountability questions might include: Whom have you blessed this week? With whom have you eaten? Have you sensed any promptings from God? What scriptures or resources have encouraged your growth? How have you sensed yourself carrying out God's work?

#### The Priesthood of All Believers

Movements that change the world are "people movements"—every believer as a minister, empowered for mission. This is rooted in the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers. Empowerment is a core leadership function; Jesus modeled this by sending his disciples into active, meaningful service soon after calling them. People should be recognized as agents of the Kingdom from the moment they come to faith.

#### Action-Reflection

Discipleship is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Deuteronomy encourages forming faith through daily life rhythms. Follow Jesus's model: on-the-road, in the world—not just in formal religious settings. Establish regular times to act, reflect, pray, and build theological frameworks together. Both formal and informal practices of action-reflection are essential.

#### Coaching

Coaching is an intentional relationship where a coach helps the individual grow in Christlikeness through setting goals, reflection, and accountability. The process involves setting goals and evaluating progress, engaging in discipleship, reflecting with the coach on experiences, and the coach helping identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Good coaches listen actively, ask insightful questions, help clarify and celebrate goals, and challenge, train, and disciple holistically.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Wesleyan Movement

The Methodist movement, founded in eighteenth-century Britain by John Wesley, provides a powerful example of disciple making. Following a life-changing encounter with God, Wesley began to travel throughout Great Britain with a vision for the conversion and discipling of a nation. Within a generation, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement was becoming a worldwide phenomenon.

The key to Methodism's success was the high level of commitment expected of participants. This cause declined to the degree that the movement had moved away from its original missional ethos of evangelism and disciple making. In 1850, when leaders required four years of ordination studies, growth ceased straightaway. Ten years later, when they no longer required classes and bands—discipleship had become an optional extra—Methodism has been in decline ever since.

#### Church Multiplication Associates

Neil Cole of Church Multiplication Associates developed Life Transformation Groups (LTGs), a very simple, duplicable, disciple-making system. The key to their remarkable growth to five hundred churches was their resolute commitment to discipleship: "We want to lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple."

Their rationale was that if the experience of church is so simple that just about anyone can do it, and the church is made up of people who have taken up their cross and follow Jesus at any cost, the result will be a movement that empowers the common Christian to do the uncommon works of God. Churches will become healthy, fertile, and reproductive.

#### The Early Church Catechisms

By AD 170, the underground Christian movement had developed what it called the catechisms. These were not merely the doctrinal confessions they later became; they involved rigorous personal examinations that required the catechumen to demonstrate why he or she was worthy of baptism and entry into the confessing community. Not only could proposed converts lose their life because of persecution, but they also had to prove why they believed they should be allowed to become part of the Christian community in the first place. Many were turned away because they were found unworthy.

This is contrary to the "seeker-sensitive" practice so prevalent in our day. It was this element of vigorous discipleship that characterized the early Christian movement, which was blighted by the deluge of worldliness that flooded the post-Constantinian church when the bar was lowered for membership.

#### South Melbourne Restoration Community

Alan and Debra Hirsch's experience at South Melbourne Restoration Community provides a personal example of disciple making in a challenging context. This inner-city church was made up largely of people who were on the fringes of society—from the homosexual to the prostitute, the schizophrenic to the drug addict. Many said of them that they were the first port of call for those on their way into the church and the last port of call for those on their way out.

They learned that most problems could be traced back to failures in discipleship. If discipleship involves our life in Christ and his life in and through us, then many problems can be traced to breakdowns in this connection. For whatever reasons, Jesus's "software" was not properly downloaded into their lives.

### Practical Applications

#### Creating a Culture of Discipleship

Encouraging a significant portion of your community—such as one-quarter of your members—to meet regularly in small groups for prayer and accountability can decisively influence the culture of your group. When discipleship is expected of everyone, and when key people participate in discipleship practices, a community ethos emerges in which spiritual growth is seen as both normal and desirable.

This involves talking about and expecting growth, providing resources and tools, and leading by example. Leaders must model spiritual growth. You cannot expect others to pursue a discipleship lifestyle that leaders do not demonstrate. As the saying goes, "Habits are more easily caught than taught."

#### Empowering People to Utilize Their Gifts

As per Ephesians 4, discipleship is about equipping God's people for service. God has gifted every believer uniquely. Practical steps include encouraging completion of a spiritual gift analysis, using 360-degree evaluations, mapping out community gifts, organizing regular gatherings for those with similar gifts, and commissioning all members for service in every context.

#### Establishing Action-Reflection Practices

Discipleship is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Establish regular times to act, reflect, pray, and build theological frameworks together. Both formal and informal practices of action-reflection are essential. Follow Jesus's model: on-the-road, in the world—not just in formal religious settings.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan first introduced disciple making as a critical element of mDNA in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006). He established it as perhaps the next most critical element after Jesus is Lord, because it is the essential task of discipleship to embody the message and mission of Jesus. The concept was developed through historical examples and contemporary applications.

### Refinements

In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), Alan provided practical habits and practices for fostering discipleship. He addressed the challenge of creating a culture of discipleship, discussed discipleship group models, and explored the priesthood of all believers.

In *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch), Alan provided comprehensive treatment of missional discipleship, addressing obstacles to discipleship in theology, culture, and personal issues. He explored the challenge of consumerism and domestication, providing practical guidance for untamed discipleship.

In *Disciplism* (2019), Alan connected evangelism to comprehensive discipleship, reimagining evangelism through the lens of discipleship.

### Current Understanding

Alan's current understanding emphasizes that disciple making is the essential task that embodies the message and mission of Jesus. It is perhaps the next most critical element after Jesus is Lord. The challenge of consumerism has been increasingly emphasized as the major threat to authentic discipleship in the West. The connection to movement dynamics has been strengthened, showing how disciple making is essential for missional impact.

The concept has been refined to show how movements that take discipleship seriously unlock transformative power. The goal is to "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple." This creates movements that empower the common Christian to do the uncommon works of God.

### Objection 1: "This sounds too demanding—people will be scared away."

**Alan's Response**: The goal is to "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple." If the experience of church is so simple that just about anyone can do it, and the church is made up of people who have taken up their cross and follow Jesus at any cost, the result will be a movement that empowers the common Christian to do the uncommon works of God. Churches will become healthy, fertile, and reproductive. The early church required rigorous examination before baptism, and many were turned away. Yet the movement grew exponentially.

### Objection 2: "This will create legalism and works-righteousness."

**Alan's Response**: Discipleship is not about earning salvation through works, but about responding to the grace of God through comprehensive transformation. We are saved by grace through faith, but this salvation works itself out in discipleship. The goal is not legalistic rule-keeping, but becoming like Jesus through relationship and transformation.

### Objection 3: "This is too focused on individual transformation and not enough on mission."

**Alan's Response**: Discipleship and mission are inseparable. We are sent as disciples who make disciples. Mission flows from discipleship, and discipleship is lived out in mission. The goal is not individual transformation for its own sake, but transformation that results in missional engagement. Disciples live with a sense of mission, understanding that they are sent into the world to be salt and light.

### Objection 4: "This is too complicated—we need simple programs."

**Alan's Response**: Discipleship is not about programs, but about life-on-life relationships. Life Transformation Groups and DNA Groups are examples of simple, reproducible patterns for disciple making. The goal is to make disciple making simple enough that anyone can do it, yet comprehensive enough that it results in transformation. Programs can support discipleship, but they cannot replace it.

### Objection 5: "This doesn't work in our consumerist culture."

**Alan's Response**: Consumerism is indeed the major threat to authentic discipleship in the West. That is precisely why we must actively resist it. We must find a way to deal with consumerism if we are going to be effective witnesses for the way of Jesus. This requires recognizing consumerism as a competing religion and actively working against the consumerist mindset that treats faith as a product to be consumed rather than a life to be lived.
