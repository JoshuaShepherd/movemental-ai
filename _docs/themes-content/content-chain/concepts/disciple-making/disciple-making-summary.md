## Core Definition

Disciple making is the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus, the Founder. It is the core practice of forming people into the image of Christ through life-on-life relationships, intentional formation, and comprehensive transformation. At its core, discipleship is about becoming like Jesus—transformation that comes from walking closely with Jesus and allowing his Spirit to shape us into his image. Missional movements appear to the observer simply as disciple-making systems that never get beyond disciple making as a core practice.

## Key Points

1. **The Essential Task**
   - Disciple making is perhaps the next most critical element in mDNA after Jesus is Lord
   - It is the essential task of discipleship to embody the message and mission of Jesus
   - If we fail on this point, we must fail in all the others

2. **The Starting Point and Key to Impact**
   - Discipleship is at once the starting point, the abiding strategic practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact
   - Missional movements are essentially disciple-making systems
   - Without meaningful discipleship, there can be no real movement

3. **Comprehensive Transformation**
   - Discipleship involves following Jesus, learning from Jesus, being transformed by Jesus, multiplying disciples, and living missionally
   - It is not about intellectual assent, but about comprehensive transformation
   - We never move beyond being a disciple on the way

4. **The Challenge of Consumerism**
   - Consumerism is the major threat to authentic discipleship in the West
   - It offers identity, purpose, meaning, and community—all the things that religion offers
   - We must actively resist the consumerist mindset that treats faith as a product

5. **Raising the Bar**
   - We must "lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple"
   - Make church simple enough that anyone can participate, but demanding enough that it requires genuine commitment
   - Discipleship must be the central requirement, not an optional extra

6. **Simple, Reproducible Systems**
   - Life Transformation Groups (LTGs) and DNA Groups provide simple, duplicable patterns
   - These systems are required for all who call themselves Christians, including leadership
   - Simplicity allows the message to be easily transferred

7. **The Priesthood of All Believers**
   - Movements that change the world are "people movements"—every believer as a minister
   - Empowerment is a core leadership function
   - People should be recognized as agents of the Kingdom from the moment they come to faith
