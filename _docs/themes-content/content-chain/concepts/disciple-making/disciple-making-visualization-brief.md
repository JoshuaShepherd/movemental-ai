## Concept Overview

Disciple making is the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus, the Founder. This core practice forms people into the image of Christ through life-on-life relationships, intentional formation, and comprehensive transformation. Visual representations should convey both the simplicity and the comprehensiveness of this practice—simple enough that anyone can do it, yet comprehensive enough that it results in transformation.

The visual challenge is to communicate that disciple making is not about programs or curricula, but about life-on-life relationships. It is forged in everyday life, blending action and reflection. Visual metaphors should capture this relational, transformative, and reproducible nature.

## Visual Metaphors

### The Apprenticeship Model

**Description**: Disciple making as apprenticeship—learning by watching, doing, and reflecting, much like a craftsman apprenticing with a master. This metaphor emphasizes the relational, hands-on nature of discipleship.

**Visual Elements**: 
- Master and apprentice working together
- Hands-on learning and demonstration
- Progression from observation to practice to mastery
- Relationship and proximity emphasized

**Use Cases**: Illustrations of the disciple-making process, diagrams showing progression, presentations on relational discipleship

### The Seed and the Tree

**Description**: Disciple making as planting seeds that grow into trees that produce more seeds. This metaphor emphasizes multiplication and organic growth.

**Visual Elements**:
- Seed planted in soil
- Growth from seed to sapling to mature tree
- Fruit/seeds produced by the tree
- Multiplication pattern showing exponential growth

**Use Cases**: Multiplication diagrams, growth illustrations, movement development visuals

### The River and Its Tributaries

**Description**: Disciple making as a river that flows and branches into tributaries, each carrying the same water. This metaphor emphasizes flow, multiplication, and the same essence being passed on.

**Visual Elements**:
- Main river flowing
- Tributaries branching off
- All carrying the same water
- Flow and movement emphasized

**Use Cases**: Flow diagrams, multiplication patterns, movement expansion visuals

### The DNA Replication

**Description**: Disciple making as DNA replication—the genetic code being passed on accurately to create identical copies. This metaphor emphasizes faithful reproduction and the essential nature of what is being passed on.

**Visual Elements**:
- DNA double helix
- Replication process
- Identical copies being created
- Genetic code being preserved

**Use Cases**: Fidelity diagrams, reproduction illustrations, movement genetics visuals

## Additional Notes

Disciple making is both profoundly simple and comprehensively transformative. Visual representations should capture this dual nature—simple enough to be easily understood and reproduced, yet comprehensive enough to show the full scope of transformation. The visual should inspire commitment to the disciple-making process while remaining accessible and actionable.

Avoid visual elements that suggest programs or curricula. Disciple making is about relationships, so visuals should emphasize connection, proximity, and life-on-life interaction. Use organic shapes and flowing lines rather than rigid geometric forms.

The visual should convey movement and multiplication, not static maintenance. Disciple making creates movement, so visuals should suggest growth, flow, and expansion. Use patterns that show multiplication and organic growth.
