## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is disciplism?

**Answer:** Disciplism is the practice of reimagining evangelism through the transformative lens of discipleship. It represents a paradigm shift from treating evangelism as an event-based activity focused on securing conversions to understanding evangelism as an integral part of the lifelong process of making disciples. The central insight is that the key to church health, extension, and renewal is more discipleship. When we make disciple-making our priority, evangelism occurs naturally within that relational and formative process.

Disciplism recognizes that disciple-making must begin before conversion and continue throughout a person's life. The Great Commission commands us to "make disciples of all nations," and while evangelism is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied in the process and context of making disciples. Disciplism challenges us to refocus on discipleship as the organizing principle and allow evangelism to take place within that framework.

This concept emerged from recognizing that despite preserving many traditions over 2,000 years, the church has largely forgotten the essential mandate to make disciples. Disciplism offers a way to recover this practice while reframing how we understand and engage in evangelism.

### Q2: Does disciplism mean we stop sharing the gospel or doing evangelistic events?

**Answer:** Disciplism does not mean we stop sharing the Good News. It reframes how and when we share, locating it within the relational context of discipleship. When we love Jesus and the people we engage, the Good News surfaces naturally. The Holy Spirit awakens interest in those being called, and our role is to commit ourselves to making disciples of whomever wishes to journey with us.

We need not rush to present formulas in unnatural or forced ways. Evangelistic events can still be valuable when they're part of a broader discipleship strategy, but they should serve the goal of disciple-making rather than being the primary strategy. The question is: does this event, this approach, help us make disciples? If it does, it can be part of disciplism. If it only produces decisions without formation, we need to reconsider.

The key is integration: evangelism happens as we make disciples, sharing the gospel within the context of relationship and formation rather than as a separate activity disconnected from ongoing discipleship.

### Q3: How does pre-conversion discipleship work?

**Answer:** Pre-conversion discipleship recognizes that conversion is a process that begins even before formal regeneration. Discipleship should start before a person becomes a Christian and continue afterward. Evangelism happens along the way as we share life and faith.

Jesus himself provides the pattern. When precisely were his disciples "born again"? At the start of the Gospels? The end? Most would say it was later—perhaps with the resurrection or Pentecost. Yet these followers were being discipled before their formal conversion, participating in ministry and learning from Jesus throughout the Gospels.

The early church practiced this through the catechumenate system (100-300 A.D.), requiring seekers—called "catechumens"—to demonstrate commitment by living the ethics of Jesus under the guidance of a sponsor, often for years, before being baptized or fully included in the community. Discipleship started long before formal conversion.

Practically, this means we invite people to journey with us, learn from us, and participate in the life of the community before they make a commitment to Jesus. We form them into the way of Jesus, and along the way, they come to faith. Discipleship may begin with generic mentoring and shift toward a more explicitly Christ-centered focus as time goes on, always proceeding in loving, relational fashion.

### Q4: Doesn't this approach take too long? People want quick conversions.

**Answer:** While it's true that our consumeristic culture prefers quick, easy solutions, the question is: what kind of Christians do we want to produce? The early church required years of preparation before baptism, and they transformed societies. World-changing movements throughout history—the Early Church, Celts, Moravians, Methodists, Pentecostals, Chinese house churches, Indian churches—have always prioritized discipleship.

The goal is not quick decisions but transformed lives. When we prioritize disciple-making, we see both numerical growth and deep transformation. For example, Community Christian Church and the NewThing Network, which prioritize disciple-making, have grown to around 50,000 people while maintaining deep formation. The motive isn't mere pragmatism—we do this because it is right and is Jesus' command.

Some people will come to faith quickly; others will take longer. Disciplism honors the process rather than rushing it. The quality of disciples matters more than the speed of conversion, and disciples who are properly formed multiply themselves, creating sustainable growth.

### Q5: How does disciplism address consumerism?

**Answer:** Disciplism directly confronts consumerism, recognizing it as a prevailing religion in Western culture that has infected much of contemporary Christianity. The principle "what you win them with, you win them to" applies: if we use entertainment to attract, we must continue entertaining to retain. This is unsustainable.

Consumeristic methods do not produce obedient followers of Jesus. One cannot consume their way into the Kingdom. The way of salvation is through the cross: surrender, transformation, and formation. Discipleship, rooted in loyalty to our covenant King, must confront the idolatries of our age.

By making discipleship central from the beginning, disciplism challenges people to count the cost, to take up their cross, to deny themselves. This is incompatible with consumerism, which promises fulfillment and ease. Disciplism calls people to a deeper, more authentic following of Jesus that transforms every aspect of life.

### Q6: What's the relationship between disciplism and the Great Commission?

**Answer:** The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) is the primary biblical foundation for disciplism. A fresh reading of this passage reveals that the explicit command is to "make disciples," not to do evangelism. The text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making, with evangelism implied in the process and context.

The passage reveals several critical points: universal mission (all nations), apostolic seed (apostles represent the church), disciple-making mandate (expecting reproduction), baptism into God's family, and promise of ongoing presence. Notably, evangelism is not explicitly mentioned. The church growth movement's focus on event-based proclamation represents a reductionist reading that narrows the vision.

Disciplism takes the Great Commission at face value: our primary calling is to make disciples. When we do this, evangelism happens naturally within that process. We're not adding to or subtracting from the commission; we're recovering its original intent and scope.

### Q7: How does disciplism relate to Christology?

**Answer:** Disciplism is fundamentally about Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ. His humanity shows us what we are to become (Romans 8:28-30; 2 Corinthians 3:18; 1 John 2:5-6). Everything in disciplism centers on Jesus—his incarnation, works, words, life, commands, and commissions shape the entire process.

Many of the Church's ailments trace to a deficient understanding and engagement with Jesus. A correction at this point—our Christology—promises the best chance of renewal. New Testament Christianity is defined by engagement with God in Christ, not a generic idea of God. Diminishing the centrality of Jesus leads to a loss of our distinct calling as disciples.

The Gospel is both: Jesus as Savior and Lord. We cannot separate his salvation from his lordship. Discipleship is the way we show we take Jesus seriously. A church that takes discipleship seriously takes Jesus and the Gospel seriously; a church that neglects this non-negotiable aspect of faith misses the point.

### Q8: What does disciplism look like in practice?

**Answer:** Practically, disciplism looks like this: You know your neighbor Jack. As a disciple-maker, you might say, "Jack, I want to help you achieve your greatest dreams." If Jack agrees, meaningful conversations will follow, eventually uncovering his deepest longings and fears. In time, God will work in Jack's life; but even after he gives his life to Jesus, discipleship must continue.

Discipleship may begin with generic mentoring and shift toward a more explicitly Christ-centered focus as time goes on, always proceeding in loving, relational fashion. We commit ourselves to making disciples of whomever wishes to journey with us, whether that person converts quickly or slowly.

At the church level, disciplism means prioritizing disciple-making as the organizing principle. All programs, events, and activities serve the goal of making disciples. Small groups become disciple-making communities where pre-Christians can participate, learn, and be formed before and after conversion. The entire church culture centers on formation rather than attraction.

### Q9: How is disciplism different from just adding discipleship to evangelism?

**Answer:** Disciplism represents a more fundamental shift than simply adding discipleship to evangelism. Disciplism argues that discipleship is the primary framework, and evangelism occurs within it. We begin with the end in mind—making disciples—and the entire process is shaped by that goal from the beginning.

This is different from the common pattern of doing evangelism first (getting decisions) and then adding discipleship later (as optional follow-up). That approach has largely failed to produce obedient followers of Jesus. The Great Commission commands us to make disciples, with evangelism implied within that process, not the other way around.

Disciplism challenges the artificial separation between evangelism and discipleship that has characterized much of Western Christianity. It's not about doing both; it's about integrating them within a discipleship framework where evangelism happens naturally as we form people into the image of Christ.

### Q10: What if people don't want to be discipled before they believe?

**Answer:** This is a fair question, and it requires wisdom and grace. Disciplism doesn't mean we force people into a discipleship process they don't want. It means we invite people to journey with us, learn from us, and participate in the life of the community. Some will be open to this; others won't be.

The key is invitation, not coercion. We offer relationship, community, and formation, and people can choose to engage. For those who aren't ready, we continue to love them, share life with them, and be available when they are ready. Disciplism doesn't eliminate all forms of evangelism; it reframes them within a discipleship context.

Some people will come to faith quickly and then need discipleship. Others will need formation before they can even understand the gospel. Disciplism honors both paths while making discipleship central rather than optional.

### Q11: How does disciplism work with the evangelistic gift (APEST)?

**Answer:** Disciplism actually enhances the evangelistic gift rather than diminishing it. When evangelistic ministry happens within a discipleship framework, it becomes more effective and sustainable. The evangelistic gift functions best when it's part of a comprehensive approach to making disciples.

People with evangelistic gifts can still use their gifts to share the gospel, invite people to faith, and create opportunities for people to respond. But within disciplism, these activities serve the broader goal of making disciples. The evangelistic gift helps people enter the discipleship journey, and it continues to function as people are formed into the image of Christ.

All fivefold ministries (APEST) support disciple-making. The evangelistic gift, when properly understood and practiced within disciplism, becomes even more powerful because it's integrated with the other gifts and the overall goal of formation.

### Q12: Can disciplism work in attractional churches?

**Answer:** Disciplism can work in various contexts, including churches that use attractional methods, but it will require some adjustments. The key question is: do your attractional methods serve the goal of making disciples, or do they primarily serve the goal of getting people in the door?

If attractional methods are part of a broader discipleship strategy where people are formed into the image of Christ, they can be valuable. But if attractional methods are the primary strategy and discipleship is optional follow-up, then disciplism challenges that approach.

Many churches find that as they move toward disciplism, they naturally become more missional and less purely attractional. But disciplism doesn't require eliminating all attractional elements; it requires making discipleship the organizing principle that shapes everything else.

### Q13: What about the urgency of sharing the gospel? Doesn't disciplism slow things down?

**Answer:** There is urgency in sharing the gospel, and disciplism doesn't eliminate that. It reframes how we understand urgency. The urgency isn't just about getting people to make a decision; it's about forming them into obedient followers of Jesus who will multiply themselves.

When we rush people into decisions without formation, we may gain converts but lose disciples. When we take time to form people properly, we gain disciples who multiply, creating sustainable growth and transformation. Which approach is truly urgent?

Additionally, disciplism doesn't mean we delay sharing the gospel. It means we share the gospel within the context of ongoing discipleship, and we continue that formation whether someone believes quickly or slowly. The urgency is about faithfulness to the process, not just speed of conversion.

### Q14: How does disciplism relate to the missional-incarnational impulse?

**Answer:** Disciplism operates within the missional framework of sentness and incarnation. As we live among those who don't yet know Jesus (incarnational), we disciple them (missional). Disciplism happens as we go, as we share life with people in their contexts.

The missional-incarnational impulse means we are sent into the world and we live among people, embodying the gospel in specific contexts. Disciplism is how we engage people in that context—we form them into the image of Christ as we share life together.

These concepts are deeply integrated: missional-incarnational impulse provides the framework for how we live, and disciplism provides the framework for how we engage people in that living. We can't separate them; they work together to create authentic, transformative mission.

### Q15: What are some examples of disciplism in practice?

**Answer:** Several contemporary examples illustrate disciplism:

**Soma Communities** (Tacoma, WA), led by Jeff Vanderstelt, practices a lifelong process of gospel integration. In the pre-conversion phase, discipleship includes evangelism, and after conversion, the emphasis shifts but the journey continues.

**Community Christian Church** (Chicago), founded by Dave and Jon Ferguson, launched the NewThing Network to catalyze reproducing churches "relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God." They view everyone as returning to God and design their ministries for disciple-making, using "apprenticeship" to emphasize lifelong learning. The movement has grown to around 50,000 people.

**3DM** (Mike Breen) has created disciple-making movements where discipleship is central from the beginning, with evangelism happening within that context.

Historical examples include: the Early Church (catechumenate system), Celtic missions, Moravians, Early Methodists, Early Pentecostals, Chinese house churches, and the Church in India—all prioritized disciple-making as central to their mission.

### Q16: How do we measure success in disciplism?

**Answer:** Success in disciplism is measured by the quality and multiplication of disciples, not just the number of decisions or conversions. Key indicators include: Are people being formed into the image of Christ? Are they growing in obedience to Jesus? Are they making disciples of others? Are they living missionally in their contexts?

Quantitative measures can include: number of people in discipleship relationships, number of new disciples being made, multiplication of groups and communities, engagement in mission. But these numbers must be evaluated in light of quality: Are these truly disciples, or just people attending programs?

The ultimate measure is multiplication: Are disciples making disciples? This is what Jesus commanded, and it's the sign that disciplism is working. When disciples reproduce themselves, creating a movement of disciple-making, we know we're on the right track.

### Q17: What are common mistakes when implementing disciplism?

**Answer:** Common mistakes include:

1. **Making it too complicated:** Disciplism is fundamentally relational and can be simple. Don't over-program it.

2. **Being too rigid:** While disciplism has principles, it allows for flexibility. Different people need different approaches.

3. **Neglecting the gospel:** Some people worry that disciplism means we don't share the gospel clearly. We must share the gospel, but within the context of discipleship.

4. **Expecting immediate results:** Disciplism is a long-term strategy. It takes time to see the fruit of proper formation.

5. **Separating it from mission:** Disciplism must happen in the context of mission, not just in safe Christian environments.

6. **Making it optional:** Disciplism challenges us to make disciple-making central, not just another program among many.

### Q18: How does disciplism address the "non-discipleship of the church"?

**Answer:** Dallas Willard identified the "non-discipleship of the church" as a critical problem, and disciplism directly addresses this. The church has largely forgotten the essential mandate to make disciples, and disciplism offers a way to recover this practice.

Disciplism argues that almost all of the church's current problems can be traced, at least in part, to a lack of clear understanding and practice of discipleship. When we recover discipleship as central, we address root causes rather than symptoms.

By making disciple-making the organizing principle of our mission, disciplism ensures that discipleship is not optional but central. It's not just another program; it's the framework that shapes everything else. This is how we address the non-discipleship problem: by making discipleship the priority from the beginning.

### Q19: What role does the Holy Spirit play in disciplism?

**Answer:** The Holy Spirit is essential to disciplism. It is the Holy Spirit who awakens interest in those being called. We don't manipulate or force people; we love Jesus and the people we engage, and the Holy Spirit works in their hearts.

The Holy Spirit empowers us to make disciples, as promised in the Great Commission: "I am with you always, to the end of the age." We don't do this in our own strength but in the power of the Spirit.

The Holy Spirit also guides the process, helping us know when to share the gospel, how to form people, and what next steps to take. Disciplism requires sensitivity to the Spirit's leading, not just following a formula.

### Q20: How does disciplism relate to church growth?

**Answer:** Disciplism can lead to significant church growth, but growth is not its primary goal. The primary goal is making disciples, and growth is a byproduct of faithful disciple-making.

When disciples are properly formed, they multiply themselves, creating natural growth. Movements that prioritize disciple-making—like NewThing Network (50,000+ people), the Early Church, Moravians, Methodists, and others—have experienced both numerical growth and deep transformation.

But disciplism challenges the consumeristic approach to church growth that focuses on attracting crowds. It focuses on making disciples who multiply, which creates sustainable, transformative growth rather than just adding numbers.

The question is: what kind of growth do we want? Disciplism produces growth that is deep, sustainable, and multiplies itself. This is the kind of growth that transforms communities and creates movements.
