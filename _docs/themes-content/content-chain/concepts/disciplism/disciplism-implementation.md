## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for implementing disciplism in your church or ministry context. Disciplism represents a fundamental shift from treating evangelism as event-based activity to understanding evangelism as integrated within the lifelong process of making disciples. This implementation guide walks through assessment, planning, and step-by-step implementation, addressing common pitfalls and providing success indicators. Whether you're beginning from scratch or transitioning from a traditional approach, this guide offers a roadmap for making disciple-making central to your mission.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **How do we currently understand evangelism?** Is it primarily event-based, program-driven, or relationship-oriented? What's our primary method for sharing the gospel?

2. **What's the relationship between evangelism and discipleship in our context?** Do we treat them as separate activities? Is discipleship optional follow-up to evangelism?

3. **When does discipleship begin?** Do we only disciple people after they've made a decision? Or do we invite people into formation before conversion?

4. **What happens to new converts?** Do they enter a discipleship process? Is it mandatory or optional? How long does it last?

5. **Are we producing disciples who multiply?** Do our disciples make disciples of others? Or do we primarily add people through attraction and programs?

6. **How do we measure success?** Do we measure decisions, attendance, or discipleship depth? What metrics do we use?

7. **What's our approach to pre-Christians?** Do we invite them into our community and formation process? Or do we wait until they convert?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: Disciplism Readiness Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluates current understanding and practice of disciplism principles

**How to Use**: 
- Complete individually or as leadership team
- Rate each statement 1-5 (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree)
- Areas scoring 3 or below indicate areas needing development

**Statements**:
1. We understand evangelism as occurring within discipleship, not as separate activity
2. We invite pre-Christians into formation and community before conversion
3. Discipleship is central to our mission, not optional follow-up
4. We measure success by discipleship depth and multiplication, not just decisions
5. Our approach confronts consumerism rather than catering to it
6. We prioritize process-oriented formation over event-based conversion
7. Discipleship is relational and contextual, not programmatic
8. We expect and equip disciples to make disciples of others

**Scoring**: 
- 32-40: Ready for advanced implementation
- 24-31: Good foundation, ready for implementation
- 16-23: Some understanding, needs development before implementation
- 8-15: Significant work needed on understanding and foundation

#### Tool 2: Current Practice Inventory

**Purpose**: Documents current evangelism and discipleship practices

**How to Use**:
- List all current evangelism activities and methods
- List all current discipleship activities and methods
- Note how they relate (or don't relate) to each other
- Identify gaps and opportunities for integration

**Inventory Areas**:
- Evangelism activities: What do we do? When? How often?
- Discipleship activities: What do we do? Who participates? When does it begin?
- Integration points: Where do evangelism and discipleship connect?
- Gaps: What's missing? What's disconnected?

**Scoring**: Review inventory to identify integration opportunities and gaps

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Current practices have been assessed and documented
- [ ] Team recognizes need for change (not just adding another program)
- [ ] Key leaders are committed to making discipleship central
- [ ] Resources are available for implementation (time, people, training)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Making It Too Complicated

**Description**: Over-programming disciplism, turning it into another complex system

**Why It Happens**: We're used to programs and systems, so we try to systematize disciplism

**How to Avoid**:
- Keep it simple: relationship, journey, formation
- Focus on principles, not programs
- Start small and organic
- Learn from examples but adapt to your context

**If You're Already There**: Simplify. Strip away complexity. Return to basic principles: make disciples who make disciples.

### Pitfall 2: Neglecting the Gospel

**Description**: In focusing on discipleship, some worry we're not sharing the gospel clearly

**Why It Happens**: Misunderstanding that disciplism de-emphasizes evangelism

**How to Avoid**:
- Remember: disciplism reframes evangelism, doesn't eliminate it
- Share the gospel naturally within relationships
- Train people to share the gospel relationally
- Trust the Holy Spirit to work through relationships

**If You're Already There**: Increase gospel clarity within discipleship relationships. Train people to share the gospel naturally.

### Pitfall 3: Being Too Rigid

**Description**: Applying disciplism principles rigidly without flexibility for different contexts

**Why It Happens**: Trying to replicate models exactly rather than adapting principles

**How to Avoid**:
- Focus on principles, not methods
- Adapt to your context
- Allow for different approaches
- Learn from mistakes and adjust

**If You're Already There**: Increase flexibility. Allow experimentation. Focus on outcomes (disciples making disciples) more than methods.

### Pitfall 4: Separating from Mission

**Description**: Disciplism happening only in safe Christian environments, not in mission contexts

**Why It Happens**: Comfort and safety can override missional impulse

**How to Avoid**:
- Keep disciplism connected to mission
- Practice disciplism in missional contexts
- Live among those who don't know Jesus
- Remember: missional-incarnational impulse is key

**If You're Already There**: Intentionally move disciplism into missional contexts. Connect formation to mission.

### Pitfall 5: Making It Optional

**Description**: Treating disciplism as another program option rather than central framework

**Why It Happens**: Difficulty changing existing structures and priorities

**How to Avoid**:
- Make disciple-making the organizing principle
- Align all activities with disciplism goals
- Make it clear this is central, not optional
- Lead by example

**If You're Already There**: Clarify priorities. Make difficult decisions. Align structures with disciplism principles.

### Pitfall 6: Expecting Immediate Results

**Description**: Expecting quick results and giving up when change takes time

**Why It Happens**: Cultural pressure for quick results, impatience with process

**How to Avoid**:
- Understand disciplism is long-term strategy
- Set realistic expectations
- Celebrate small wins
- Remember: formation takes time

**If You're Already There**: Adjust expectations. Celebrate progress. Focus on faithfulness over speed.
