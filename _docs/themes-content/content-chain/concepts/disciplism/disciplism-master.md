## Executive Summary

Disciplism represents a fundamental recalibration of how we understand and practice evangelism. At its core, disciplism is the recognition that evangelism must happen within the broader context of discipleship, and that disciple-making—beginning before conversion and continuing throughout a person's life—is the church's primary mission. This concept challenges the prevailing pattern of event-based evangelism that treats conversion as an endpoint, proposing a way of mission that centers on forming people into the image of Christ from the very beginning of their journey.

The central insight of disciplism is this: the key to church health, extension, and renewal is more discipleship. When we make disciple-making our priority, evangelism occurs naturally within that process. The Great Commission explicitly calls us to "make disciples of all nations"—a command that encompasses both pre-conversion and post-conversion formation. Jesus himself discipled his followers long before their formal conversion at Pentecost, and the early church practiced rigorous pre-baptismal discipleship. Disciplism recovers this pattern for our time.

This framework matters because it addresses one of the most significant gaps in contemporary Western Christianity: the widespread absence of authentic disciple-making. While churches have preserved many traditions over two millennia, they have largely forgotten the essential mandate to make disciples. This neglect is a root cause of many problems facing the church today. When discipleship becomes central, everything else—worship, mission, evangelism—falls into proper alignment.

**Key Points:**
- Disciplism reframes evangelism as occurring within the context of discipleship, beginning before conversion
- The Great Commission commands us to make disciples, with evangelism implied within that process
- Pre-conversion discipleship was the pattern of Jesus and the early church
- Discipleship confronts consumerism and forms people into the image of Christ
- Discipleship is about Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ
- The church's neglect of disciple-making is a correctable problem that requires returning to basics
- Discipleship, worship, and mission are different dimensions of the same reality

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Disciplism is the practice of reimagining evangelism through the transformative lens of discipleship. It represents a paradigm shift from treating evangelism as an event-based activity focused on securing conversions to understanding evangelism as an integral part of the lifelong process of making disciples. At its heart, disciplism recognizes that disciple-making must begin before conversion and continue throughout a person's life, with evangelism occurring naturally within that relational and formative context.

The term "disciplism" itself signals this integration. Disciplism challenges the artificial separation between evangelism and discipleship that has characterized much of Western Christianity. It proposes that we have gotten things backward: we have made evangelism the priority and treated discipleship as optional follow-up. Disciplism argues for the reverse: disciple-making is the priority, and evangelism happens within that process.

This definition emerges from a careful reading of the Great Commission, which commands us to "make disciples of all nations" but does not explicitly mention evangelism. The text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making, with evangelism implied in the process. This reading challenges the church growth movement's focus on event-based proclamation, suggesting that such an approach represents a reductionist understanding of the commission.

Disciplism is fundamentally about formation—forming people into the image of Christ. This formation begins when someone first expresses interest in following Jesus, continues through their conversion, and extends throughout their lifetime. It is relational, process-oriented, and holistic, addressing the whole person rather than merely seeking a decision. Disciplism understands that people cannot consume their way into the Kingdom; the way of salvation is through the cross, involving surrender and transformation.

### Common Misunderstandings

One common misunderstanding of disciplism is that it de-emphasizes sharing the gospel. This misses the point entirely. Disciplism reframes how and when we share the Good News, locating it within the relational context of discipleship. When we love Jesus and the people we engage, the Good News surfaces naturally. The Holy Spirit awakens interest in those being called, and our role is to commit ourselves to making disciples of whomever wishes to journey with us.

Another misunderstanding suggests that disciplism is simply adding discipleship to evangelism, or doing evangelism first and then discipleship. Disciplism represents a more fundamental shift: discipleship is the primary framework, and evangelism occurs within it. We begin with the end in mind—making disciples—and the entire process is shaped by that goal from the beginning.

Some interpret disciplism as a rejection of proclamation or evangelistic events. Disciplism does not require abandoning these practices, but it does challenge us to examine whether they serve the goal of disciple-making. When evangelistic events are part of a broader discipleship strategy, they can be valuable. When they become the primary strategy, they often fail to produce obedient followers of Jesus.

A fourth misunderstanding treats disciplism as merely an adjustment to methodology. While disciplism has methodological implications, it is fundamentally a theological and missiological correction. It stems from understanding that discipleship is intrinsic to the life and mission of the church, that it addresses the root cause of many problems facing contemporary Christianity, and that obedience to Jesus' explicit commands requires prioritizing disciple-making.

### Why It Matters

Disciplism matters because it addresses one of the most significant gaps in contemporary Western Christianity: the widespread absence of authentic disciple-making. A fair reading of the New Testament clearly positions discipleship and disciple-making at the very heart of the church's gospel mandate. Yet despite preserving many traditions over 2,000 years—doctrinal quirks, inexplicable rituals, and marginal practices—the church has somehow all but forgotten this essential mandate.

This neglect has consequences. Almost all of the church's current problems can be traced, at least in part, to a lack of clear understanding and practice of discipleship. The absence of disciple-making contributes to shallow faith, consumeristic patterns, lack of mission, and the perpetuation of a form of Christianity that fails to transform lives or impact communities. When discipleship is neglected, the church becomes something other than what Jesus intended.

Disciplism matters because it offers a correctable path forward. This is a fixable issue; we can return to basics. When we recover discipleship as the central practice, we address root causes rather than symptoms. Discipleship is not a quick fix, but it is the only long-term solution to much that ails our churches. Mike Breen of 3DM provocatively argued that the missional church will fail if it does not prioritize discipleship. Disciplism takes this seriously, making disciple-making the organizing principle of our mission.

This framework matters because it realigns the church with its true purpose. If God's mission is to "sum up all things in Christ" (Ephesians 1:10), then church attendance, quiet times, and random voluntarism are insufficient. We need a comprehensive approach to formation that shapes every aspect of life. Disciplism provides that framework, recognizing that worship, mission, and discipleship are different dimensions of the same reality.

Finally, disciplism matters because it confronts the idolatries of our age, especially consumerism. One cannot consume their way into the Kingdom. The way of salvation is through the cross: surrender, transformation, and formation. Disciplism—rooted in loyalty to our covenant King—challenges the consumeristic patterns that have infected much of Western Christianity, calling people to a deeper, more authentic following of Jesus.

### Biblical Foundations

The primary biblical foundation for disciplism is the Great Commission, found in Matthew 28:18-20:

> "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"

A fresh reading of this passage reveals several critical points. First, the explicit command is to "make disciples," not to do evangelism. The text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making. Second, the commission includes baptism into the name of the Triune God and teaching obedience to Jesus' commands, indicating that obedience, not mere decision or prayer, is the expected response. Third, the promise of Jesus' ongoing presence empowers all who engage in this commission.

The Great Commission applies to all believers at all times. The apostles represent the Church that would emerge from their ministry, and the commission's scope is universal—"all nations." This is the redemptive purpose of God through His church, a "pay-it-forward" movement where disciples reproduce themselves through discipling others.

Mark 12:28-31 provides another foundational text, where Jesus articulates his version of the Shema:

> "And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, 'Which commandment is the first of all?' Jesus answered, 'The first is, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength." The second is this, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." There is no other commandment greater than these.'"

If we truly grasp the theology and worldview of the Shema, we recognize that mission is implied in loving God and our neighbor. The term "discipleship" ought to stand alone, carrying the full weight of biblical spirituality defined by this dual love. Worship, mission, and discipleship are simply different dimensions of the same reality.

The pattern of Jesus' own ministry with his disciples provides another biblical foundation. When precisely were his disciples "born again"? At the start of the Gospels? The end? Most would say it was later—perhaps with the resurrection or Pentecost. Yet these followers were being discipled before their formal conversion, participating in ministry and learning from Jesus. This pattern suggests that discipleship can and should begin before conversion.

Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus calling people to follow him, to take up their cross, to deny themselves. The call to discipleship is not optional; it is inherent in the gospel itself. Jesus says, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me" (Mark 8:34). This is not a secondary consideration; it is the fundamental call.

Paul's writings reinforce this pattern. In Romans 8:28-30, we see God's purpose: "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son." In 2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul speaks of being transformed into the image of Christ. And in 1 John 2:5-6, we read that "whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked." Discipleship is about Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ.

### Theological Framework

Disciplism fits within a broader theological framework centered on Christology. Michael Frost and Alan Hirsch stated in *ReJesus* that many of the Church's ailments trace to a deficient understanding and engagement with Jesus. A correction at this point—our Christology—promises the best chance of renewal. Nowhere is this truer than in discipleship.

New Testament Christianity is defined by engagement with God in Christ, not a generic idea of God. Diminishing the centrality of Jesus leads to a loss of our distinct calling as disciples. Too often, Western Christianity emphasizes Jesus' saving work on the cross while minimizing his words, actions, and radical call. We seek to domesticate him, separating his salvation from his lordship. This is a dangerous heresy.

Disciplism insists that the Gospel is both: Jesus as Savior and Lord. Evangelicals rightfully embrace Jesus as Savior, but we must also embrace his call to follow as Lord and example. His humanity shows us what we are to become. Discipleship is the way we show we take Jesus—his incarnation, works, words, life, commands, and commissions—seriously.

Everything is about Jesus. C.S. Lewis articulated this clearly: "The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became man for no other purpose." A church that takes discipleship seriously takes Jesus and the Gospel seriously; a church that neglects this non-negotiable aspect of faith misses the point—dangerously.

Disciplism also fits within the framework of the missio Dei—the mission of God. God sends his Son, and we ourselves become a sent people. This sentness (missional) and embodiment (incarnational) form one action: missional-incarnational impulse. Disciplism operates within this framework, recognizing that discipleship happens as we live among those who don't yet know Jesus, forming people into his image as we go.

The theological framework also includes an understanding of conversion as process rather than event. While regeneration may happen at a moment, the process of coming to faith and being formed in faith is ongoing. Disciplism honors this process, beginning discipleship before conversion and continuing it throughout life. This aligns with the early church's practice of catechumenate—a period of preparation and formation before baptism.

Finally, disciplism understands the church's role in God's redemptive purposes. If God's mission is to "sum up all things in Christ" (Ephesians 1:10), then disciple-making is central to that mission. The church exists to form people into the image of Christ, and this formation begins when someone first expresses interest, continues through conversion, and extends throughout their lifetime.

### Historical Examples

The historical pattern of discipleship beginning before conversion is well-established. The early Church practice (100-300 A.D.) required seekers—"catechumens"—to demonstrate commitment by living the ethics of Jesus under the guidance of a sponsor, often for years, before being baptized or fully included. Discipleship started long before formal conversion. These early practices transformed societies because they took disciple-making seriously and would not tolerate consumerism.

Jesus himself provides the primary historical example. His disciples followed him, learned from him, and participated in ministry long before Pentecost, when they received the Holy Spirit in fullness. They were being formed into his image throughout the Gospels, and this formation continued after his resurrection and ascension.

World-changing movements throughout history have always prioritized discipleship. The Early Church (before Constantine) formed communities where discipleship was central. Celtic missions combined mission with intensive formation. The Moravians created communities of deep discipleship that fueled global mission. Early Methodists under John Wesley practiced class meetings and bands that formed people methodically. Early Pentecostalism emphasized both conversion and ongoing formation. The Chinese house churches have maintained discipleship patterns even under persecution. The Church in India has grown through disciple-making movements.

These movements share a common characteristic: they made disciple-making central to their identity and mission. They understood that movements are built on disciples, and disciples are formed through intentional, relational, long-term investment in people's lives. They did not separate evangelism from discipleship; they integrated them within a comprehensive approach to formation.

Contemporary examples also illustrate disciplism. Soma Communities in Tacoma, WA, led by Jeff Vanderstelt, practices a lifelong process of gospel integration. In the pre-conversion phase, discipleship includes evangelism, and after conversion, the emphasis shifts but the journey continues.

Community Christian Church in Chicago, founded by Dave and Jon Ferguson, launched the NewThing Network to catalyze reproducing churches "relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God." They view everyone as returning to God and design their ministries for disciple-making, using "apprenticeship" to emphasize lifelong learning. The movement, now around 50,000 strong, grows rapidly, proving that prioritizing disciple-making can result in vibrant church growth.

These examples demonstrate that disciplism is not merely theoretical but practically viable. When churches make disciple-making their priority and allow evangelism to occur within that context, they experience both numerical growth and deep transformation. The motive isn't mere pragmatism—we do this because it is right and is Jesus' command.

### Evolution of Thought

Disciplism represents a development in Alan Hirsch's thinking about discipleship and evangelism. In *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), he established disciple-making as one of the six strategic elements of mDNA, foundational to missional movement. In *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch), he explored the spiritual and relational dynamics of discipleship.

*Disciplism* represents a more focused treatment, specifically addressing how evangelism relates to discipleship. This book emerged from questions Alan received about discipleship, reflecting a significant lack of understanding in the broader church. The book is more direct and polemical in some ways, calling out the "alarming" ignorance about disciple-making.

The concept has evolved from being one element among six in mDNA to being a framework for understanding and reforming evangelism. This represents a practical application of the mDNA framework, showing how one element (disciple-making) can reshape an entire area of ministry (evangelism).

The emphasis on pre-conversion discipleship represents a significant contribution, showing that the pattern of Jesus and the early church was to begin formation before formal conversion. This challenges the common evangelical pattern of conversion first, then discipleship.

The integration of disciplism with Christology (Chapter 6) shows the theological depth of the concept. This isn't merely a methodological shift but a theological correction that centers everything on Jesus and his lordship.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### The Great Commission Re-Read

A central subtopic within disciplism is the fresh reading of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20). This passage, so familiar to many Christians, is re-examined to reveal what it actually commands. The explicit command is to "make disciples," not to do evangelism. The text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making, with evangelism implied in the process.

A fresh reading reveals: universal mission (Jesus sends with global scope), apostolic seed (the apostles represent the emerging church), disciple-making mandate (clear command expecting reproduction), baptism into God's family (radically inclusive act), and promise of presence (ongoing empowerment). Notably, evangelism is not explicitly mentioned.

#### Pre-Conversion Discipleship

Another key subtopic is the recognition that conversion is a process that begins even before formal regeneration. Discipleship should start before a person becomes a Christian and continue afterward. Evangelism happens along the way as we share life and faith.

Jesus himself provides the pattern: his disciples followed him, learned from him, and participated in ministry long before Pentecost. The early church practiced this through the catechumenate system, requiring seekers to demonstrate commitment by living Jesus' ethics under a sponsor's guidance, often for years, before baptism.

#### Consumerism and Discipleship

Disciplism directly confronts consumerism, recognizing it as a prevailing religion in Western culture. Shopping malls serve as sites of spiritual seeking. The principle "what you win them with, you win them to" applies: if we use entertainment to attract, we must continue entertaining to retain. This is unsustainable.

Consumeristic methods do not produce obedient followers of Jesus. One cannot consume their way into the Kingdom. The way of salvation is through the cross: surrender, transformation, and formation. Discipleship, rooted in loyalty to our covenant King, must confront the idolatries of our age.

#### Christology and Discipleship

Disciplism emphasizes that discipleship is fundamentally about Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ. His humanity shows us what we are to become (Romans 8:28-30; 2 Corinthians 3:18; 1 John 2:5-6). Everything is about Jesus.

The Gospel is both: Jesus as Savior and Lord. We cannot separate his salvation from his lordship. Discipleship is the way we show we take Jesus—his incarnation, works, words, life, commands, and commissions—seriously.

#### Discipleship, Worship, and Mission as One Reality

The Shema (Mark 12:28-31) reveals that worship, mission, and discipleship are simply different dimensions of the same reality. If we truly grasp the theology and worldview of the Shema, we recognize that mission is implied in loving God and our neighbor. To recover discipleship is to recover both true worship and mission.

#### The Church's Neglect of Disciple-Making

A significant subtopic is diagnosing the problem: despite preserving many traditions over 2,000 years, the church has largely forgotten the essential mandate to make disciples. Most Christians are not even aware of a call to discipleship, and still fewer understand what it means to submit themselves to its joys and demands.

This neglect is a root cause of many problems facing the contemporary church. Almost all current problems can be traced, at least in part, to a lack of clear understanding and practice of discipleship. This is a correctable issue; we must return to basics.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Story of Jesus and His Disciples

The primary story illustrating pre-conversion discipleship is Jesus' own ministry. When precisely were his disciples "born again"? At the start of the Gospels? The end? Most would say it was later—perhaps with the resurrection or Pentecost. Yet these followers were being discipled before their formal conversion, participating in ministry and learning from Jesus throughout the Gospels.

This pattern suggests that discipleship can and should begin before conversion. Jesus called them to follow, and they did—learning, serving, and being formed—long before they received the fullness of the Spirit at Pentecost.

#### Early Church Catechumenate

The early church (100-300 A.D.) practiced rigorous pre-baptismal discipleship. Seekers, called "catechumens," were required to demonstrate commitment by living the ethics of Jesus under the guidance of a sponsor, often for years, before being baptized or fully included in the community. Discipleship started long before formal conversion.

These early practices transformed societies because they took disciple-making seriously and would not tolerate consumerism. They were not "seeker-sensitive" in the modern sense, yet they were profoundly effective.

#### Case Study: Soma Communities

Soma Communities in Tacoma, WA, led by Jeff Vanderstelt, practices a lifelong process of gospel integration. In the pre-conversion phase, discipleship includes evangelism, and after conversion, the emphasis shifts but the journey continues. This illustrates disciplism in practice.

#### Case Study: Community Christian Church & NewThing Network

Community Christian Church in Chicago, founded by Dave and Jon Ferguson, launched the NewThing Network to catalyze reproducing churches "relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God." They view everyone as returning to God and design their ministries for disciple-making, using "apprenticeship" to emphasize lifelong learning.

The movement, now around 50,000 strong, grows rapidly, proving that prioritizing disciple-making can result in vibrant church growth. The motive isn't mere pragmatism—they do this because it is right and is Jesus' command.

#### The Neighbor Jack Example

A practical example illustrates disciplism: "You know your neighbor Jack. As a disciple-maker, you might say, 'Jack, I want to help you achieve your greatest dreams.' If Jack agrees, meaningful conversations will follow, eventually uncovering his deepest longings and fears. In time, God will work in Jack's life; but even after he gives his life to Jesus, discipleship must continue."

Discipleship may begin with generic mentoring and shift toward a more explicitly Christ-centered focus as time goes on, always proceeding in loving, relational fashion.

#### Historical Movements

World-changing movements throughout history have always prioritized discipleship: the Early Church (before Constantine), Celtic missions, the Moravians, Early Methodists, Early Pentecostalism, the Chinese underground church, the Church in India. These movements share a common characteristic: they made disciple-making central to their identity and mission.

#### The Willow Creek REVEAL Study

The church growth movement, epitomized by the Willow Creek REVEAL study, acknowledged: "We're good at getting decisions for Christ, but not so great at making disciples." This honesty is commendable and illustrates the problem disciplism addresses.

### Practical Applications

Disciplism applies across multiple contexts:

**Individual Level:** Disciples begin making disciples of others, starting with those who express interest. They commit to the process, whether that person converts quickly or slowly, recognizing that formation is lifelong.

**Small Group Level:** Groups become disciple-making communities where pre-Christians can participate, learn, and be formed before and after conversion. The group's purpose is formation, not just fellowship.

**Church Level:** Churches prioritize disciple-making as their organizing principle. All programs, events, and activities serve the goal of making disciples. Evangelism occurs within this framework.

**Movement Level:** Movements are built on disciples who make disciples. The focus is on multiplication through formation, not just addition through attraction.

### Common Questions Addressed

Disciplism addresses several common questions:

- How do we do evangelism in a post-Christian culture?
- Why don't our converts become mature disciples?
- How can we integrate evangelism and discipleship?
- What's wrong with our current approach to evangelism?
- How did the early church grow so effectively?
- What's the relationship between conversion and discipleship?
- How do we avoid consumerism in our evangelism?

### Misconceptions and Corrections

Common misconceptions corrected by disciplism:

**Misconception:** Disciplism means we stop sharing the gospel.  
**Correction:** Disciplism reframes how and when we share, locating it within relational discipleship where the Good News surfaces naturally.

**Misconception:** We do evangelism first, then add discipleship.  
**Correction:** Discipleship is the framework from the beginning; evangelism occurs within it.

**Misconception:** Disciplism is just adding discipleship to evangelism.  
**Correction:** Disciplism represents a fundamental shift where discipleship is primary and evangelism is integrated within it.

**Misconception:** This is just a methodological change.  
**Correction:** Disciplism is a theological and missiological correction that centers on Jesus and his lordship.

### Connections to Other Concepts

Disciplism connects deeply to other core concepts:

**Disciple Making (mDNA):** Disciplism is the application of disciple-making to evangelism, ensuring this mDNA element is properly practiced.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse (mDNA):** Disciplism operates within the missional framework of sentness and incarnation, forming people as we live among them.

**Jesus is Lord (mDNA):** Disciplism is about forming people into the image of Christ, acknowledging his lordship.

**Evangelistic Ministry (APEST):** Disciplism redefines evangelistic ministry within the context of discipleship.

**Organic Systems (mDNA):** Disciple-making is inherently reproducible and organic, multiplying through relationships.

## 4. Scripture Reference Index

### Primary Scripture References

#### Matthew 28:18-20 (The Great Commission)

**Text:** "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"

**Context:** Jesus' final commission to his disciples before ascending to heaven, after his resurrection.

**Alan's Interpretation:** The explicit command is to "make disciples," not to do evangelism. The text binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making. Evangelism is implied in the process and context of making disciples, not the other way around. The passage reveals: universal mission (all nations), apostolic seed (apostles represent the church), disciple-making mandate (with expectation of reproduction), baptism into God's family, and promise of ongoing presence.

**Theological Significance:** This is the church's primary commission, and it centers on disciple-making. The church growth movement's focus on event-based proclamation represents a reductionist reading that narrows the vision and diminishes the mission.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 3: Hear O Israel

#### Mark 12:28-31 (The Great Commandment)

**Text:** "And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, 'Which commandment is the first of all?' Jesus answered, 'The first is, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength." The second is this, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." There is no other commandment greater than these.'"

**Context:** Jesus' answer to a scribe's question about the greatest commandment.

**Alan's Interpretation:** This is Jesus' version of the Shema, and it defines biblical spirituality. If we truly grasp the theology and worldview of the Shema, we recognize that mission is implied in loving God and our neighbor. The term "discipleship" ought to stand alone, carrying the full weight of this dual love. Worship, mission, and discipleship are simply different dimensions of the same reality.

**Theological Significance:** This provides the theological foundation for understanding discipleship as comprehensive, encompassing love for God and neighbor, which inherently includes mission.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Introduction

#### Mark 8:34 (Take Up Your Cross)

**Text:** "And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, 'If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.'"

**Context:** Jesus' teaching on the cost of discipleship after Peter's confession.

**Alan's Interpretation:** The call to discipleship is not optional; it is inherent in the gospel itself. This is not a secondary consideration but the fundamental call. Following Jesus involves denial, cross-bearing, and ongoing obedience.

**Theological Significance:** Discipleship is not an add-on to the gospel but central to it. We cannot separate following from believing.

**Source:** Referenced in disciplism framework

#### Romans 8:28-30 (Conformed to Christ's Image)

**Text:** "We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified."

**Context:** Paul's teaching on God's purpose for believers in the context of suffering and hope.

**Alan's Interpretation:** God's purpose is to conform us to the image of his Son. This is the goal of discipleship: Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ. His humanity shows us what we are to become.

**Theological Significance:** Discipleship has a clear goal: transformation into Christ's image. This is not optional but God's predestined purpose.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 6: It's All About Jesus

#### 2 Corinthians 3:18 (Transformed into Christ's Image)

**Text:** "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."

**Context:** Paul's contrast between the old and new covenants, emphasizing transformation.

**Alan's Interpretation:** We are being transformed into Christ's likeness. This is an ongoing process, "from one degree of glory to another," emphasizing that discipleship is lifelong formation.

**Theological Significance:** Discipleship is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of transformation as we behold Christ.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 6: It's All About Jesus

#### 1 John 2:5-6 (Walk as Jesus Walked)

**Text:** "But whoever keeps his word, in him truly love for God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked."

**Context:** John's teaching on knowing God and abiding in him.

**Alan's Interpretation:** Discipleship means walking as Jesus walked. It's about following his example, not just believing correct doctrine. This is how we show we abide in him.

**Theological Significance:** True discipleship involves imitation of Jesus, living as he lived.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 6: It's All About Jesus

#### Ephesians 1:10 (Sum Up All Things in Christ)

**Text:** "As a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth."

**Context:** Paul's description of God's redemptive plan in Christ.

**Alan's Interpretation:** If God's mission is to "sum up all things in Christ," then church attendance, quiet times, and random voluntarism are insufficient. We need a comprehensive approach to formation that shapes every aspect of life.

**Theological Significance:** Discipleship serves God's cosmic purpose of uniting all things in Christ. This gives discipleship its ultimate significance.

## 5. Concept Relationships

### Dependencies

Disciplism depends on several foundational concepts:

**Disciple Making (Tier 2, mDNA Element):** Disciplism assumes and builds upon the concept of disciple-making. Without a clear understanding of what discipleship is, disciplism cannot function.

**Jesus is Lord (Tier 2, mDNA Element):** Disciplism is fundamentally about forming people into the image of Christ, which requires acknowledging his lordship. Everything in disciplism centers on Jesus.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse (Tier 2, mDNA Element):** Disciplism operates within the missional framework. As we live among those who don't yet know Jesus (incarnational), we disciple them (missional).

**mDNA Framework (Tier 1):** Disciplism supports and depends on the broader mDNA framework, ensuring that disciple-making—one of the six elements—is properly understood and practiced.

### Contains

Disciplism contains or includes:

- Pre-conversion discipleship practices
- Integration of evangelism within discipleship
- Christ-centered formation processes
- Relational disciple-making approaches
- Process-oriented rather than event-oriented evangelism

### Related Concepts

**Evangelistic Ministry (Tier 3, APEST Element):** Disciplism redefines how we understand and practice evangelistic ministry, locating it within discipleship rather than as a separate activity. The evangelistic gift functions best within a disciplism framework.

**Organic Systems (Tier 2, mDNA Element):** Disciple-making is inherently reproducible and organic, multiplying through relationships. Disciplism aligns with organic systems thinking.

**Liminality-Communitas (Tier 2, mDNA Element):** The discipleship process often involves liminal spaces and intense community formation. Disciplism creates contexts for communitas to emerge.

**From Attractional to Missional (Tier 4):** Disciplism supports the shift from attractional (come to us) to missional (go to them) approaches, as discipleship happens in relationship as we go.

### Integration Patterns

Disciplism integrates with other concepts in several ways:

**With mDNA Framework:** Disciplism ensures that disciple-making—one of the six mDNA elements—is properly practiced and doesn't become optional or secondary.

**With APEST Framework:** The evangelistic gift functions best within a disciplism framework, and all fivefold ministries support disciple-making.

**With Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Disciplism happens as we live among those who don't yet know Jesus, forming them into his image as we go.

**With Organic Systems:** Disciple-making multiplies naturally through relationships, creating organic growth patterns.

**With Liminality-Communitas:** The discipleship process creates liminal spaces where intense community (communitas) forms around shared mission.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan Hirsch first addressed discipleship strategically in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), where he established disciple-making as one of the six essential elements of mDNA, foundational to missional movement. He recognized that movements require disciples, and disciples are formed through intentional investment.

In *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch), he explored the spiritual and relational dynamics of discipleship, moving from strategic importance to personal and relational dimensions.

### Refinements

*Disciplism: Reimagining Evangelism Through the Lens of Discipleship* represents a significant refinement and focus. This book emerged from questions Alan received about discipleship, reflecting a significant lack of understanding in the broader church. The book is more direct and addresses the specific relationship between evangelism and discipleship.

The emphasis on pre-conversion discipleship represents a major contribution, showing that the pattern of Jesus and the early church was to begin formation before formal conversion. This challenges the common evangelical pattern.

The integration with Christology (Chapter 6) shows theological depth, connecting disciplism to the centrality of Jesus. This isn't merely a methodological shift but a theological correction.

### Current Understanding

Disciplism is currently understood as:

1. **A framework for evangelism:** Evangelism occurs within the context of discipleship, not as a separate activity.

2. **Pre-conversion formation:** Discipleship begins before conversion, following the pattern of Jesus and the early church.

3. **Christ-centered:** Everything in disciplism centers on forming people into the image of Christ.

4. **Process-oriented:** Discipleship is a lifelong process, not an event or program.

5. **Relational:** Disciplism happens in relationship, as we share life and faith with others.

6. **Integrative:** Discipleship, worship, and mission are different dimensions of the same reality.

7. **Corrective:** Disciplism addresses the church's neglect of disciple-making and offers a way forward.

The concept continues to develop as churches experiment with disciplism practices and as Alan continues to reflect on the relationship between evangelism and discipleship in various contexts.

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "This de-emphasizes sharing the gospel."

**Alan's Response:** Disciplism does not mean we stop sharing the Good News. It reframes how and when we share, locating it within the relational context of discipleship. When we love Jesus and the people we engage, the Good News surfaces naturally. The Holy Spirit awakens interest in those being called, and our role is to commit ourselves to making disciples of whomever wishes to journey with us. We need not rush to present formulas in unnatural or forced ways.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 5: Reimagining Evangelism

### Objection 2: "We should do evangelism first, then add discipleship."

**Alan's Response:** This approach has been tried and has largely failed to produce obedient followers of Jesus. The Great Commission commands us to "make disciples," with evangelism implied within that process. When we aim at evangelism as it is currently understood, we rarely arrive at discipleship. The real solution is to refocus on discipleship and allow evangelism to take place within that context. We begin with the end in mind—making disciples—and the entire process is shaped by that goal from the beginning.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Reframing Evangelism Within Discipleship

### Objection 3: "This is just adding discipleship to evangelism."

**Alan's Response:** Disciplism represents a more fundamental shift: discipleship is the primary framework, and evangelism occurs within it. This isn't merely adding one thing to another but reimagining the entire approach. Discipleship must be central from beginning to end. To add discipleship and obedience only after a conversion event is problematic; discipleship should start before a person becomes a Christian and continue afterward.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 4: Go Make Consumers of All Nations?

### Objection 4: "This is just a methodological change."

**Alan's Response:** While disciplism has methodological implications, it is fundamentally a theological and missiological correction. It stems from understanding that discipleship is intrinsic to the life and mission of the church, that it addresses the root cause of many problems facing contemporary Christianity, and that obedience to Jesus' explicit commands requires prioritizing disciple-making. It centers on Jesus and his lordship, making it a theological matter, not merely methodological.

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 6: It's All About Jesus

### Objection 5: "People won't respond to this; they want quick conversions."

**Alan's Response:** While it's true that our consumeristic culture prefers quick, easy solutions, the question is: what kind of Christians do we want to produce? The early church required years of preparation before baptism, and they transformed societies. World-changing movements have always prioritized discipleship. The goal is not quick decisions but transformed lives. When we prioritize disciple-making, we see both numerical growth and deep transformation, as evidenced by movements like NewThing Network (50,000+ people).

**Source:** *Disciplism*, Chapter 5: Reimagining Evangelism

### Objection 6: "This doesn't work in our context/culture."

**Alan's Response:** Disciplism has worked across diverse contexts: the early church, Celtic missions, Moravians, Methodists, Pentecostals, Chinese house churches, Indian churches, and contemporary movements like Soma and NewThing. The pattern is consistent: movements that prioritize disciple-making grow and transform. The question is whether we're willing to adjust our methods to align with biblical patterns rather than demanding that biblical patterns adjust to our preferences.
