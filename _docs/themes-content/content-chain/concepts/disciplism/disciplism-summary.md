## Core Definition

Disciplism is the practice of reimagining evangelism through the transformative lens of discipleship. It represents a paradigm shift from treating evangelism as an event-based activity focused on securing conversions to understanding evangelism as an integral part of the lifelong process of making disciples. Disciplism recognizes that disciple-making must begin before conversion and continue throughout a person's life, with evangelism occurring naturally within that relational and formative context. At its heart, disciplism argues that the key to church health, extension, and renewal is more discipleship—when we make disciple-making our priority, evangelism occurs naturally within that process.

## Key Points

1. **Evangelism Within Discipleship**
   - The Great Commission commands us to "make disciples," with evangelism implied within that process, not the other way around
   - When discipleship is the primary framework, evangelism occurs naturally as we share life and faith with others

2. **Pre-Conversion Discipleship**
   - Discipleship should start before a person becomes a Christian and continue afterward, following the pattern of Jesus and the early church
   - Jesus discipled his followers long before Pentecost, and the early church practiced rigorous pre-baptismal formation through the catechumenate system

3. **Confronting Consumerism**
   - Consumeristic methods do not produce obedient followers of Jesus
   - The principle "what you win them with, you win them to" applies: we must align our methods with our goals of forming disciples

4. **Christ-Centered Formation**
   - Discipleship is about Christ being formed in us and us being formed in Christ
   - Everything centers on Jesus—his incarnation, works, words, life, commands, and commissions shape the entire process

5. **Comprehensive Reality**
   - Worship, mission, and discipleship are simply different dimensions of the same reality
   - To recover discipleship is to recover both true worship and mission

6. **Correctable Problem**
   - The church's widespread neglect of disciple-making is a root cause of many current problems
   - This is a fixable issue that requires returning to basics and prioritizing disciple-making

7. **Process-Oriented Approach**
   - Disciplism is process-oriented rather than event-oriented, treating formation as lifelong rather than focusing solely on conversion moments
