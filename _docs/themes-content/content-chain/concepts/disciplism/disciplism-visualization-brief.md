## Concept Overview

Disciplism is the practice of reimagining evangelism through the transformative lens of discipleship. The central visual challenge is communicating that evangelism occurs within discipleship, not as a separate activity, and that disciple-making begins before conversion and continues throughout life. The concept emphasizes process over event, relationship over program, and formation over decision. Visual representations should show integration, continuity, and the relational nature of the process while highlighting that discipleship is the primary framework containing evangelism.

## Visual Metaphors

### Journey/Pathway Metaphor

**Description**: Disciplism as a journey where people walk together along a path, with conversion happening along the way rather than at a gate or checkpoint. The path continues before and after conversion, representing the lifelong process of discipleship. Evangelism happens as people share the journey together.

**Visual Elements**:
- A winding path or road extending from horizon to horizon
- People walking together along the path
- A moment of conversion represented subtly (perhaps a marker or sign, not a barrier)
- The path continues beyond the conversion point
- Evangelism shown as people inviting others to join the journey
- Community and relationship emphasized through proximity of walkers

**Use Cases**: Process diagrams, timeline representations, journey illustrations, pathway graphics

### Container/Integration Metaphor

**Description**: Discipleship as a large container or framework that holds everything, with evangelism as an element within it. This visual emphasizes that discipleship is primary and evangelism is integrated within it, not the other way around.

**Visual Elements**:
- Large container labeled "Discipleship" (could be circle, box, or organic shape)
- Smaller elements within labeled "Evangelism," "Formation," "Community," "Mission"
- Evangelism positioned as one element among others, not separate
- Everything connected within the discipleship container
- Perhaps showing pre-conversion and post-conversion phases as areas within the container

**Use Cases**: Framework diagrams, concept maps, integration illustrations, system representations

### Seed/Tree Growth Metaphor

**Description**: Disciplism as a seed that grows into a tree, representing the organic, process-oriented nature of formation. The seed contains everything needed for growth, and growth happens over time. Evangelism is part of the growth process, not a separate action.

**Visual Elements**:
- Seed at the beginning
- Roots developing (pre-conversion formation)
- Sprout emerging (conversion moment)
- Tree growing and maturing (post-conversion formation)
- Fruit and seeds for multiplication (disciple-making others)
- Growth happening gradually, not instantly
- Natural, organic shapes and colors

**Use Cases**: Growth illustrations, process visuals, organic movement graphics, lifecycle representations

### Relationship Web/Network Metaphor

**Description**: Disciplism as a network of relationships where people are connected to each other and to Jesus, with disciple-making happening through these relational connections. Evangelism occurs as new connections form.

**Visual Elements**:
- Central node representing Jesus
- Connected nodes representing people
- Lines showing relationships and connections
- Some nodes connected directly to Jesus, others connected through others
- New nodes joining the network (evangelism)
- Thicker lines showing deeper relationships (discipleship)
- Organic, interconnected web pattern

**Use Cases**: Network diagrams, relationship maps, community visualizations, connection graphics

## Diagram Concepts

### Diagram Type 1: Disciplism Process Flow

**Purpose**: Show the flow of disciplism from initial contact through ongoing formation, with evangelism integrated throughout

**Structure**:
- **Entry Point**: Person expresses interest or curiosity
- **Pre-Conversion Phase**: Journey together, formation begins, gospel shared relationally
- **Conversion Moment**: Decision/commitment to Jesus (shown as milestone, not endpoint)
- **Post-Conversion Phase**: Ongoing formation, deeper discipleship, multiplication begins
- **Multiplication**: Discipling others (cycle repeats)

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Circular flow showing the cycle repeating
- Or linear with feedback loops showing ongoing relationship
- Conversion moment should be visually integrated, not dramatically separated
- Arrows showing movement and process
- Perhaps using a spiral to show deepening over time

**Visual Style**: Clean, flowing lines; warm, relational colors; emphasis on continuity

### Diagram Type 2: Disciplism Framework Integration

**Purpose**: Show how evangelism fits within the discipleship framework

**Structure**:
- **Outer Container**: "Discipleship" (primary framework)
- **Core Element**: "Jesus is Lord" (center)
- **Integrated Elements**: Evangelism, Formation, Community, Mission, Obedience
- **Context**: Pre-conversion and post-conversion areas within framework
- **Connections**: All elements connected to center and to each other

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Concentric circles with Jesus at center
- Or hub-and-spoke with discipleship as the hub
- Evangelism positioned as one spoke among many
- All elements shown as equal in importance within the framework
- Perhaps using overlapping circles to show integration

**Visual Style**: Balanced, integrated; clear hierarchy (Jesus at center, discipleship as container); relational colors

### Diagram Type 3: Comparison: Traditional vs. Disciplism Approach

**Purpose**: Contrast traditional evangelism-first approach with disciplism approach (using integrative language, not antithetical)

**Structure**:
- **Traditional Approach**: Shows evangelism as separate box, then optional discipleship follow-up
- **Disciplism Approach**: Shows discipleship as container with evangelism integrated throughout
- **Timeline Comparison**: Traditional shows conversion as endpoint; disciplism shows conversion as milestone in ongoing process
- **Outcome Comparison**: Traditional produces decisions; disciplism produces disciples who multiply

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Side-by-side comparison
- Or before/after format
- Use consistent visual language but show structural differences
- Emphasize integration in disciplism approach
- Show outcomes visually (maybe through icons or symbols)

**Visual Style**: Clear distinction but not oppositional; constructive presentation; emphasis on disciplism as more complete

## Process Flows

### Disciplism Journey Process

**Steps**:
1. **Invitation**: Person expresses interest or is invited into relationship
2. **Journey Together**: Begin sharing life, forming relationship, learning together
3. **Gospel Sharing**: Good News shared naturally within relationship context
4. **Conversion**: Person commits to following Jesus (milestone, not endpoint)
5. **Ongoing Formation**: Continued discipleship, deeper formation, growing obedience
6. **Multiplication**: Discipled person begins discipling others (cycle repeats)

**Visual Flow**: Circular or spiral flow showing the journey, with conversion as a marked point along the way. The flow should emphasize continuity and relationship. Perhaps use a path or river metaphor with conversion as a bridge or significant landmark along the way, not the destination.

**Decision Points**: 
- Person chooses to continue journey or not (at various points)
- Person makes commitment to Jesus (conversion moment)
- Person chooses to begin discipling others (multiplication)

## Comparison Charts

### Traditional Evangelism vs. Disciplism Approach

**Elements to Compare**:
- **Framework**: Traditional = Evangelism primary; Disciplism = Discipleship primary
- **Timing**: Traditional = Conversion first, then discipleship; Disciplism = Discipleship begins before conversion
- **Focus**: Traditional = Getting decisions; Disciplism = Forming disciples
- **Method**: Traditional = Events and programs; Disciplism = Relationship and process
- **Outcome**: Traditional = Converts (decisions); Disciplism = Disciples (formation)
- **Multiplication**: Traditional = Addition (bringing people in); Disciplism = Multiplication (disciples making disciples)

**Visual Format**: Side-by-side table or comparison chart showing each aspect. Use visual icons or symbols to represent differences. Avoid "wrong vs. right" framing; instead show disciplism as more complete approach.

## Infographic Concepts

### Infographic 1: "The Great Commission Re-Read"

**Concept**: Visual breakdown of Matthew 28:18-20 showing that the command is to "make disciples," with evangelism implied within that process.

**Elements**:
- Large text: "Make Disciples" as primary command
- Supporting elements: Baptize, Teach, Observe (all within disciple-making)
- Evangelism shown as integrated element, not separate command
- Visual emphasis on "disciples" and "nations" (scope)

**Layout**: Central focus on "Make Disciples" with supporting elements arranged around it. Use typography hierarchy to emphasize the main command.

### Infographic 2: "Pre-Conversion Discipleship Pattern"

**Concept**: Show how Jesus and early church practiced discipleship before conversion.

**Elements**:
- Timeline showing Jesus' disciples following before Pentecost
- Early church catechumenate process (years of preparation)
- Contemporary examples (Soma, NewThing)
- Key principle: Formation begins before conversion

**Layout**: Historical timeline with contemporary applications. Show the pattern repeating across history.

### Infographic 3: "Disciplism Outcomes"

**Concept**: Show what disciplism produces—disciples who multiply.

**Elements**:
- Quality indicators: Obedience, formation, multiplication
- Visual representation of multiplication (one makes two, two make four, etc.)
- Comparison of depth vs. breadth (quality over quantity, but quantity through quality)
- Movement/growth imagery

**Layout**: Visual growth pattern showing multiplication. Use icons or illustrations to represent outcomes.

## Key Visual Principles

1. **Integration over Separation**: Show evangelism within discipleship, not as separate
2. **Continuity over Breaks**: Conversion is a milestone in ongoing process, not endpoint
3. **Process over Event**: Emphasize ongoing formation, not one-time moments
4. **Relationship over Program**: Show people in relationship, not programs or structures
5. **Multiplication over Addition**: Show disciples making disciples, not just bringing people in
6. **Warmth and Invitation**: Visual style should be inviting, not harsh or demanding

---

## Additional Considerations

- Avoid visual language that suggests "before and after" in a disconnected way
- Use imagery that shows people in real relationships and community
- Emphasize the organic, natural growth aspects
- Show the centrality of Jesus without making it institutional
- Balance individual and communal aspects
- Consider cross-cultural visual accessibility
