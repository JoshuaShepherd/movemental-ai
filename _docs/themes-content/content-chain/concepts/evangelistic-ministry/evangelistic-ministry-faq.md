## Questions

### Q1: What is evangelistic ministry?

**Answer**: Evangelistic ministry is the proclaiming, connecting, multiplying ministry that fosters encounters between people and the core messages of the church, particularly the gospel. Evangelists are driven to spread the message and enlist others in the cause. They are exceptional recruiters, social connectors, and sharers of good news.

**Key Points**:
- Fosters encounters with the gospel
- Operates on continuum between proclamation and presence
- Four roles: Investors, Inviters, Convincers, Conversers
- Both event and process dynamics

### Q2: Is evangelism only about events and altar calls?

**Answer**: No. While events and altar calls can be expressions of evangelistic ministry, they are not the only or even primary expressions. Evangelistic ministry is broader, involving relationships, presence, and process-oriented approaches. The New Testament reveals both instantaneous conversion and gradual, process-oriented conversion.

**Key Points**:
- Broader than events
- Involves relationships and presence
- Both event and process legitimate
- Process often more effective

**Sources**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 3; *Disciplism*

### Q3: What is the relationship between evangelism and discipleship?

**Answer**: Evangelistic ministry must be reframed within discipleship. The key to church health is not more evangelism but more discipleship. When we aim at evangelism as currently understood, we rarely arrive at discipleship. The solution is to refocus on discipleship and allow evangelism to take place within that context.

**Key Points**:
- Evangelism reframed within discipleship
- Key is discipleship, not more evangelism
- Evangelism happens within discipleship context
- Pre-conversion discipleship is possible

**Sources**: *Disciplism*, throughout

### Q4: What are the four evangelistic roles?

**Answer**: Evangelists operate along four axes: Investors (walk with people through entire conversion process), Inviters (bring people into environments where they experience gospel), Convincers (gifted in presentational evangelism), and Conversers (specialize in dialogue and gradual discovery).

**Key Points**:
- Four distinct roles
- Each has different approach
- All legitimate and needed
- People may operate in multiple roles

**Sources**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 3

### Q5: What is the difference between proclamation and presence?

**Answer**: Proclamation is verbal sharing of the gospel message. Presence is demonstrating the gospel through close, ongoing relationships. Both are essential. Only proclamation can articulate the specifics of the Christian story, but presence prepares the soil so that proclamation can bear fruit.

**Key Points**:
- Proclamation: verbal sharing
- Presence: relational demonstration
- Both essential
- Presence prepares soil for proclamation
