## Executive Summary

Evangelistic ministry is the proclaiming, connecting, multiplying ministry that fosters encounters between people and the core messages of the church, particularly the gospel. Evangelists are driven to spread the message and enlist others in the cause. They are exceptional recruiters, social connectors, and sharers of good news.

Evangelistic intelligence manifests in three main ways: exceptional recruiters who draw people to Christ, social connectors who build relationships and mediate between God and people, and sharers of good news who help people see God's love active in their lives. Evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation (verbal sharing) and presence (incarnational relationship), both of which are essential.

**Key Points**:
- Evangelistic ministry fosters encounters between people and the gospel
- It operates on continuum between proclamation and presence
- Four evangelistic roles: Investors, Inviters, Convincers, Conversers
- Evangelistic ministry is often reduced to events, but it's broader
- Jesus is the exemplary evangelist, and all evangelistic ministry flows from his pattern
- Evangelistic ministry must be reframed within discipleship (Disciplism)

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Evangelistic ministry is the proclaiming, connecting, multiplying ministry that fosters encounters between people and the core messages of the church, particularly the gospel. Evangelists are driven to spread the message and enlist others in the cause. They are exceptional recruiters who draw people to Christ, social connectors who build relationships and mediate between God and people, and sharers of good news who help people see God's love active in their lives.

Evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation (verbal sharing) and presence (incarnational relationship). Both are essential. Only proclamation can articulate the specifics of the Christian story, but presence prepares the soil so that proclamation can bear fruit.

Evangelistic ministry has often been caricatured as confrontational or transactional. However, the New Testament reveals both instantaneous conversion (the "road to Damascus") and gradual, process-oriented conversion (the "road to Emmaus"). Both paradigms are legitimate, and a healthy approach to evangelism recognizes both event and process dynamics.

### Common Misunderstandings

**Misunderstanding 1: Evangelism is only about events**

Many people think evangelistic ministry is primarily about evangelistic events, altar calls, or confrontational approaches. While these can be expressions of evangelistic ministry, they are not the only or even primary expressions. Evangelistic ministry is broader, involving relationships, presence, and process-oriented approaches.

**Misunderstanding 2: Evangelism is separate from discipleship**

Many churches separate evangelism from discipleship, seeing them as distinct activities. However, evangelistic ministry must be reframed within discipleship. The key to church health is not more evangelism but more discipleship, and evangelism should take place within that context.

**Misunderstanding 3: Only certain people can do evangelism**

Some believe that only people with the "gift of evangelism" can do evangelistic ministry. However, Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us"—all believers are endowed with APEST gifting. While some are particularly gifted evangelistically, all believers can participate in evangelistic ministry.

**Misunderstanding 4: Evangelism is only proclamation**

Some reduce evangelistic ministry to verbal proclamation alone. However, evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation and presence. Both are essential, and presence often prepares the soil for proclamation.

### Why It Matters

Evangelistic ministry matters because the church is called to extend the gospel to all people. Without it, churches become insular communities that do not extend the good news. Evangelistic ministry ensures that the gospel reaches those who have not yet encountered it.

The church's decline in reaching new people can often be traced to the reduction of evangelistic ministry to events or the separation of evangelism from discipleship. When evangelistic ministry is reframed within discipleship, it becomes more effective and sustainable.

Evangelistic ministry is essential for the church to fulfill its mission. The Great Commission involves making disciples, and evangelistic ministry is part of that process. Without it, the church cannot fulfill its calling to extend the gospel to all nations.

### Biblical Foundations

**Ephesians 4:7–11** establishes evangelists as the third of five essential ministries given to equip God's people.

**Jesus as Exemplary Evangelist**: Jesus proclaimed and demonstrated the good news of the Kingdom. He offered every person and community an opportunity for radical reorientation, seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:9–10). Jesus is both proclaimer and content of the evangel—he is the good news.

**The Great Commission** (Matthew 28:19-20): "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." The commission involves going (apostolic), making disciples (all APEST functions), and teaching (teaching ministry). Evangelistic ministry is part of this comprehensive commission.

### Theological Framework

Evangelistic ministry is rooted in the doctrine of the gospel. The gospel is good news that must be shared. Evangelistic ministry ensures that this good news reaches all people.

Evangelistic ministry is also rooted in the doctrine of the church. The church is called to be a witnessing community, extending the gospel to all people. Evangelistic ministry is not optional but essential for the church's identity and mission.

Evangelistic ministry is Christological. Jesus is the exemplary evangelist, and all evangelistic ministry flows from his pattern. The church is the Body of Christ, and as such, it must reflect the evangelistic dimension of Jesus' ministry.

### Historical Examples

**The Early Church**: Extended the gospel throughout the known world through evangelistic ministry.

**Philip the Evangelist**: Traveled and proclaimed the gospel, exemplifying evangelistic ministry (Acts 8).

**Contemporary Examples**: Evangelists who extend the gospel through relationships, presence, and proclamation.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### Proclamation and Presence

Evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation (verbal sharing) and presence (incarnational relationship). Both are essential. Proclamation articulates the specifics of the Christian story, while presence prepares the soil so that proclamation can bear fruit.

#### Four Evangelistic Roles

Evangelists operate along four axes:
1. **Investors**: Walk with people through the entire process of conversion
2. **Inviters**: Strategically bring people into environments where they experience the gospel
3. **Convincers**: Gifted in presentational evangelism and compelling argument
4. **Conversers**: Specialize in dialogue and gradual discovery

#### Event and Process

The New Testament reveals both instantaneous conversion (the "road to Damascus") and gradual, process-oriented conversion (the "road to Emmaus"). Both paradigms are legitimate, and a healthy approach recognizes both.

#### Reframing Within Discipleship

Evangelistic ministry must be reframed within discipleship. The key is not more evangelism but more discipleship, and evangelism should take place within that context.

### Stories and Examples

**Philip the Evangelist**: Traveled and proclaimed the gospel (Acts 8)

**The Early Church**: Extended the gospel throughout the known world

**Contemporary Examples**: Evangelists extending the gospel through relationships and presence

### Objection 1: Evangelism is too confrontational

**Alan's Response**: Evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation and presence. Both are legitimate, and presence often prepares the soil for proclamation.

### Objection 2: We need more evangelism, not more discipleship

**Alan's Response**: The key to church health is not more evangelism but more discipleship. When we aim at evangelism as currently understood, we rarely arrive at discipleship. The solution is to refocus on discipleship and allow evangelism to take place within that context.
