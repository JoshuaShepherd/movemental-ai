## Core Definition

Evangelistic ministry is the proclaiming, connecting, multiplying ministry that fosters encounters between people and the core messages of the church, particularly the gospel. Evangelists are driven to spread the message and enlist others in the cause. They are exceptional recruiters who draw people to Christ, social connectors who build relationships and mediate between God and people, and sharers of good news who help people see God's love active in their lives.

## Key Points

1. **Proclamation and Presence**: Evangelistic ministry operates on a continuum between proclamation (verbal sharing) and presence (incarnational relationship). Both are essential.

2. **Four Evangelistic Roles**: Investors (walking with people), Inviters (bringing people into environments), Convincers (presentational evangelism), Conversers (dialogue and discovery).

3. **Event and Process**: Both instantaneous conversion and gradual, process-oriented conversion are legitimate. A healthy approach recognizes both.

4. **Reframed Within Discipleship**: The key to church health is not more evangelism but more discipleship. Evangelism should take place within the context of discipleship.

5. **Given to All**: Evangelistic ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a select few.

6. **Often Reduced to Events**: Evangelistic ministry is often reduced to events, but it's broader, involving relationships, presence, and process.

7. **Jesus as Exemplary**: Jesus is the exemplary evangelist, and all evangelistic ministry flows from his pattern.
