## Introduction

The fractal nature of missional movement reveals that the same missional DNA (mDNA) patterns repeat at every scale, from individual disciples to global movements. This FAQ addresses common questions about how mDNA elements operate fractally, why this matters for movement health, and how understanding fractals helps us participate in movement dynamics. These questions emerge from engagement with leaders exploring how movement patterns work at different scales and how to align with the fractal nature of missional movement.

## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is a fractal, and how does it apply to missional movement?

**Answer:** A fractal is a geometric pattern that repeats itself at different scales. In mathematics, a coastline viewed from space shows the same jagged patterns you see when examining a single rock on the beach. The pattern is scale-invariant—it looks the same whether you're viewing it from far away or up close.

In missional movement, the same mDNA elements that shape a single follower of Jesus also shape entire movements. The six elements—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas—repeat at every scale. What works at the individual level also works at the community level, the movement level, and the global level.

This fractal nature means the pattern is consistent across scales. The same DNA that creates movement globally also creates movement locally. Understanding this helps us see that we can start where we are, with what we have, aligned with the pattern.

### Q2: How do the six mDNA elements repeat at different scales?

**Answer:** Each element operates at every scale, adapting to the scale while maintaining its essence. For example, "Jesus is Lord" operates at the individual level (personal confession and obedience), the community level (communal acknowledgment and practice), and the movement level (movement-wide center and commitment).

Disciple making works similarly: at the individual level, we become like Jesus; at the community level, we form others; at the movement level, we create cultures of disciple making. The missional-incarnational impulse functions at individual level (person goes to workplace as sent one), community level (church goes to neighborhood), and movement level (movement goes to cultures).

Each element maintains its core identity while adapting to different scales. The pattern repeats, ensuring consistency and health across all levels.

### Q3: Why does the fractal nature matter?

**Answer:** The fractal nature matters because it means we can start where we are. We don't need to wait for the perfect structure or the right opportunity. The same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally. When we align with the pattern at our scale, we participate in the larger movement dynamic.

It also provides diagnostic power. When a movement struggles, we can look for which mDNA elements are missing or weak at various scales. Health at one level requires health at all levels. If the DNA is missing at any scale, the movement weakens.

The fractal nature also means our faithfulness matters. Small acts of faithfulness at the individual level become part of the larger pattern. When we get it right at our level, we contribute to the health of the whole.

### Q4: What happens if mDNA elements are missing at some scales?

**Answer:** If mDNA elements are missing at any scale, the movement weakens. Health at one level requires health at all levels. The DNA must be present everywhere for the movement to thrive. If "Jesus is Lord" is strong globally but weak locally, the movement eventually suffers. If disciple making is happening individually but not at the community level, multiplication is limited.

The fractal nature means all elements must be present at all scales. Missing elements at any scale create weakness that affects the whole. This is why diagnosis is important—identifying where elements are missing or weak helps us strengthen the movement.

The good news is that strengthening elements at one scale helps the whole. When we strengthen disciple making at the individual level, it contributes to community and movement health. The fractal nature means health flows across scales.

### Q5: How does this help us diagnose movement health?

**Answer:** The fractal nature provides a diagnostic framework. We can assess movement health by checking if all six mDNA elements are present and healthy at various scales—individual, community, movement. If elements are missing or weak at any scale, that's where we focus strengthening efforts.

For example, if a community struggles with multiplication, we can check: Is disciple making happening? Are organic systems in place? Is APEST functioning? The fractal nature tells us what should be present. Missing elements indicate where to focus.

This diagnostic power is practical. Rather than guessing what's wrong, we can systematically check each element at each scale, identify gaps, and strengthen what's missing. The pattern reveals what's needed.

### Q6: Can we really start where we are? Doesn't movement require large-scale organization?

**Answer:** Yes, we can start where we are. The fractal nature means the same pattern that creates movement globally also creates movement locally. You don't need large-scale organization to begin. You can start living the mDNA at your current scale—as an individual, in a small group, or in a local church.

When you align with the pattern at your scale, you participate in the larger movement dynamic. The pattern you embody locally is the same pattern that operates globally. Starting small doesn't mean you're outside the movement—you're participating in it at your scale.

Large-scale organization can help, but it's not required to start. The fractal nature means movement can begin and multiply from small beginnings when the pattern is present. Start where you are, align with the pattern, and let it multiply.

### Q7: How does this relate to organic systems?

**Answer:** Organic systems are one of the six mDNA elements, and they operate fractally. Organic systems that work at the individual level also work at the community and movement levels. Simple, reproducible patterns repeat at every scale.

The fractal nature means organic systems naturally operate across scales. When systems are truly organic, they repeat themselves, creating the fractal pattern. Organic systems enable the fractal nature by providing reproducible patterns that work at every scale.

Understanding this connection helps us see that organic systems aren't just one element—they enable all elements to operate fractally. Good organic systems help the whole mDNA repeat at every scale.

### Q8: What about the early church? Was it fractal?

**Answer:** Yes, the early church demonstrates the fractal nature. The same mDNA elements that worked at the individual level (disciples following Jesus) also worked at the community level (churches in various cities) and the movement level (spreading throughout the Roman Empire). The pattern repeated at every scale.

The early church shows how the fractal nature enables rapid multiplication. When the pattern is present at every scale, movement spreads quickly. The same DNA that shaped individual disciples also shaped the global movement.

Studying the early church helps us see the fractal nature in action. The pattern was consistent across scales, enabling the movement to multiply rapidly while maintaining health and faithfulness.

### Q9: How do we strengthen the fractal nature in our context?

**Answer:** Strengthening the fractal nature means ensuring all six mDNA elements are present and healthy at every relevant scale. Start by assessing which elements are present and which are missing at your current scale. Then strengthen what's missing.

Focus on one element at a time if needed. Strengthen "Jesus is Lord" at your scale. Then disciple making. Then missional-incarnational impulse. Work through all six elements, ensuring each is present and healthy.

As you strengthen elements at your scale, they contribute to health at other scales. The fractal nature means strengthening locally strengthens globally. Start where you are, strengthen what's missing, and let the pattern multiply.

### Q10: What's the relationship between fractal nature and multiplication?

**Answer:** The fractal nature enables multiplication. When the pattern repeats at every scale, it multiplies naturally. Individuals living the pattern become communities living the pattern, which become movements living the pattern. The repetition enables multiplication.

Multiplication happens when the pattern is present and repeating. The fractal nature means the pattern can multiply from any scale—individual to community to movement. As long as the pattern is present, it can multiply.

Understanding the fractal nature helps us see that multiplication isn't about programs or strategies but about the pattern repeating. When mDNA elements are present and healthy, multiplication happens naturally through the fractal repetition.
