# The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement: How mDNA Repeats at Every Scale  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for aligning with fractal patterns  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for understanding and aligning with the fractal nature of missional movement. The fractal nature means the same mDNA patterns work at every scale, from individual to global. This guide helps you assess which elements are present at your scale, strengthen what's missing, and participate in the larger movement pattern.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **What scale are you operating at?** Individual, community (small group/church), or movement level?

2. **Which mDNA elements are present at your scale?** Assess all six: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST, organic systems, liminality-communitas

3. **Which elements are missing or weak?** Identify gaps at your current scale

4. **How do elements operate at other scales?** Check individual, community, and movement levels

5. **Is the pattern repeating?** Are you seeing the same elements at different scales?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: Fractal mDNA Assessment

**Purpose**: Assess presence of mDNA elements at different scales

**How to Use**: 
- For each scale (Individual, Community, Movement), rate each mDNA element 1-5
- 1=Missing, 2=Weak, 3=Moderate, 4=Strong, 5=Very Strong
- Identify patterns: Which elements are weak at which scales?

**Elements to Assess**:
1. Jesus is Lord
2. Disciple Making
3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse
4. Apostolic Environment (APEST)
5. Organic Systems
6. Liminality-Communitas

**Scoring**: Identify where elements are missing or weak, focus strengthening efforts there

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Understand fractal nature concept
- [ ] Current scale identified
- [ ] All six mDNA elements assessed at your scale
- [ ] Missing/weak elements identified
- [ ] Strengthening plan developed
- [ ] Other scales assessed

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Understanding (Months 1-2)

**Duration**: 2 months  
**Goal**: Understand fractal nature and assess current state

#### Step 1.1: Learn Fractal Concept

- **Action**: Study fractal nature of missional movement
- **Resources Needed**: Reading materials, discussion, examples
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear understanding of fractal patterns

#### Step 1.2: Assess Current Scale

- **Action**: Identify what scale you're operating at
- **Resources Needed**: Reflection, context assessment
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear scale identification

#### Step 1.3: Assess mDNA Elements

- **Action**: Assess all six elements at your scale
- **Resources Needed**: Assessment tools, reflection time
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear picture of element presence/health

### Phase 2: Strengthening (Months 3-6)

**Duration**: 4 months  
**Goal**: Strengthen missing or weak elements at your scale

#### Step 2.1: Prioritize Elements

- **Action**: Identify which elements to strengthen first
- **Resources Needed**: Assessment results, priorities
- **Expected Outcome**: Strengthening priorities identified

#### Step 2.2: Strengthen Elements

- **Action**: Work on strengthening identified elements
- **Resources Needed**: Resources for each element, support, training
- **Expected Outcome**: Elements strengthened at your scale

#### Step 2.3: Assess Progress

- **Action**: Reassess elements, check progress
- **Resources Needed**: Assessment tools, reflection
- **Expected Outcome**: Progress tracked, adjustments made

### Phase 3: Expansion (Months 7-12)

**Duration**: 6 months  
**Goal**: Strengthen elements at other scales and see pattern multiply

#### Step 3.1: Assess Other Scales

- **Action**: Check how elements operate at other scales
- **Resources Needed**: Assessment tools, scale understanding
- **Expected Outcome**: Multi-scale assessment complete

#### Step 3.2: Strengthen Across Scales

- **Action**: Strengthen elements at multiple scales
- **Resources Needed**: Resources, support, coordination
- **Expected Outcome**: Elements strengthened across scales

#### Step 3.3: See Pattern Multiply

- **Action**: Watch for pattern repetition and multiplication
- **Resources Needed**: Observation, documentation
- **Expected Outcome**: Pattern multiplying through repetition

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Focusing on One Scale Only

**Description**: Strengthening elements at one scale while ignoring others

**How to Avoid**: Assess and strengthen at multiple scales, understand scale relationships

### Pitfall 2: Missing Elements

**Description**: Not ensuring all six elements are present

**How to Avoid**: Systematic assessment, ensure all elements present, don't skip any

### Pitfall 3: Not Understanding Fractal Nature

**Description**: Not recognizing that pattern repeats at different scales

**How to Avoid**: Study fractal concept, look for patterns across scales, understand repetition
