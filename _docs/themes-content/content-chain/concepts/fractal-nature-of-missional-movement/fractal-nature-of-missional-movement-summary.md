## Core Definition

The fractal nature of missional movement reveals that the same missional DNA (mDNA) that shapes a single follower of Jesus also shapes entire movements that span continents and centuries. Just as fractal patterns in mathematics repeat at different scales—a coastline viewed from space shows the same jagged patterns as a single rock on the beach—so the missional movement patterns repeat at every scale, from the individual disciple to the global church. The six elements of mDNA—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas—each repeat at every scale, ensuring the whole movement stays alive.

## Key Points

1. **Fractal Pattern Repeats**
   - Same mDNA elements operate at individual, community, and movement levels
   - Pattern visible at every scale—micro to macro
   - Not coincidence but design

2. **All Six Elements Required**
   - Each element must be present at every scale
   - Health at one level requires health at all levels
   - Missing elements at any scale weakens the whole

3. **Start Where You Are**
   - Pattern works at any scale
   - Don't need perfect structure or right opportunity
   - Begin living mDNA at current scale

4. **Diagnostic Power**
   - Fractal nature helps diagnose movement health
   - Identify which elements are missing or weak
   - Pattern reveals what's needed

5. **Design Not Accident**
   - Pattern is intentional, not coincidental
   - Same design principles at every level
   - Alignment with pattern enables movement

6. **Participation in Larger Pattern**
   - Small acts of faithfulness become part of larger pattern
   - Local experiments connect to global movement
   - Individual faithfulness contributes to whole

7. **Already Present**
   - Pattern is already there, not something we create
   - We align with it, not invent it
   - Movement is already present in us

> — *The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement*

> "The word 'fractal' comes from mathematics, describing geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. A coastline viewed from space shows the same jagged patterns you see when examining a single rock on the beach."  
> — *The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement*

> "Here is the promise of the fractal nature of missional movement: the same patterns that create movement at the global level also create movement at the local level."
