# The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement: Visualization Brief

**Concept**: The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement: How mDNA Repeats at Every Scale  
**Purpose**: Visual communication of fractal patterns in missional movement  
**Target Audience**: Designers, content creators, visual communicators  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Concept Overview

The fractal nature of missional movement shows how the same mDNA patterns repeat at every scale. Visual representations must clearly show scale-invariant patterns, how mDNA elements operate at different scales, and how the same pattern works from individual to global levels. The key visual challenge is communicating repetition across scales while showing how each element adapts to different scales while maintaining its essence.

## Visual Metaphors

### Coastline/Fern/Snowflake Metaphor

**Description**: Natural fractals (coastline, fern leaf, snowflake) show the same pattern at different scales. Use these to illustrate how mDNA patterns repeat.

**Visual Elements**:
- Coastline: Same jagged pattern from space and close-up
- Fern leaf: Same pattern in whole leaf and individual sections
- Snowflake: Same pattern in overall shape and detailed sections
- Apply to mDNA: Same elements at individual, community, movement scales

**Use Cases**: Introduction graphics, pattern repetition illustrations, scale-invariant demonstrations

### Nested/Concentric Circles Metaphor

**Description**: Show individual (center), community (middle ring), movement (outer ring) with same mDNA elements in each ring, showing how pattern repeats.

**Visual Elements**:
- Concentric circles representing different scales
- Same six mDNA elements shown in each ring
- Visual connection showing repetition
- Show how elements adapt while maintaining essence

**Use Cases**: Scale diagrams, mDNA element visualization, hierarchical pattern graphics

### Russian Dolls/Mandala Metaphor

**Description**: Like Russian dolls nesting inside each other, or mandala patterns repeating, show how same pattern contains itself at different scales.

**Visual Elements**:
- Nested structures showing same pattern at different sizes
- Each level containing the same elements
- Visual repetition across scales
- Show containment and repetition

**Use Cases**: Nested structure diagrams, pattern containment graphics, scale repetition visualizations

## Diagram Concepts

### Diagram Type 1: mDNA Elements Across Scales

**Purpose**: Show how each mDNA element operates at different scales

**Structure**:
- Six rows (one for each mDNA element)
- Three columns (Individual, Community, Movement scales)
- Each cell shows how that element operates at that scale
- Visual connection showing repetition

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Grid format with clear scale labels
- Use consistent visual language for each element
- Show adaptation while maintaining essence
- Use color or visual weight to show connections

**Visual Style**: Grid format, clear scale distinctions, element consistency

### Diagram Type 2: Scale-Invariant Pattern

**Purpose**: Demonstrate how same pattern appears at different scales (like zooming in/out)

**Structure**:
- Multiple views of same pattern at different zoom levels
- Individual level (close-up)
- Community level (medium view)
- Movement level (wide view)
- Same six elements visible at each level

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Zoom sequence or side-by-side comparison
- Show same elements at each scale
- Visual connection showing it's the same pattern
- Use visual techniques to show scale relationship

**Visual Style**: Zoom visualization, scale comparison, pattern consistency

### Diagram Type 3: Fractal Tree/Branching

**Purpose**: Show how pattern branches and repeats, creating fractal structure

**Structure**:
- Tree or branching structure
- Each branch shows same mDNA elements
- Repetition creates fractal pattern
- Show multiplication through repetition

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Tree diagram with branches
- Each branch labeled with scale (individual, community, movement)
- Same elements shown at each branch level
- Show how repetition enables multiplication

**Visual Style**: Tree/branching diagram, fractal structure, multiplication visualization

## Process Flows

### Fractal Assessment Process

**Steps**:
1. Identify your current scale (individual, community, movement)
2. Assess which mDNA elements are present at your scale
3. Identify missing or weak elements
4. Strengthen elements at your scale
5. Check how elements operate at other scales
6. Strengthen elements across scales
7. See pattern multiply through repetition

**Visual Flow**: Show assessment process with scale indicators and element checkpoints

## Comparison Charts

### mDNA Elements Across Scales Comparison

**Elements to Compare**:
- Each of six mDNA elements
- How each operates at: Individual, Community, Movement scales
- Adaptation vs. essence (how it adapts while maintaining core)

**Visual Format**: Table or grid showing elements across scales, with visual indicators for presence/health

## Infographic Concepts

### Infographic 1: "The Pattern Repeats"

**Concept**: Show how same mDNA pattern appears at different scales

**Elements**:
- Individual, Community, Movement scales
- Six mDNA elements shown at each scale
- Visual connection showing repetition
- Key principle: same pattern, different scales

**Layout**: Multi-scale visualization with clear pattern repetition

### Infographic 2: "Start Where You Are"

**Concept**: Show that pattern works at any scale, you can start where you are

**Elements**:
- Different starting points (individual, small group, church)
- Same pattern available at each
- Multiplication from any starting point
- Key principle: pattern works everywhere

**Layout**: Multiple entry points with same pattern available

### Infographic 3: "Diagnostic Power"

**Concept**: Show how fractal nature helps diagnose movement health

**Elements**:
- Assessment grid (elements × scales)
- Identify missing/weak elements
- Focus strengthening efforts
- Key principle: health requires all elements at all scales

**Layout**: Diagnostic grid with assessment framework

## Color and Symbol Recommendations

### Color Palette

- **Individual Scale**: Personal, intimate colors (warmer tones)
- **Community Scale**: Relational colors (medium tones)
- **Movement Scale**: Expansive colors (broader tones)
- **mDNA Elements**: Consistent colors for each element across scales
- **Connections**: Use visual connections (lines, colors) to show repetition

### Symbol Recommendations

- **Fractal Patterns**: Coastline, fern, snowflake, branching
- **Scale Indicators**: Zoom levels, nested structures, concentric circles
- **mDNA Elements**: Consistent symbols for each element
- **Repetition**: Visual repetition patterns, branching structures
- **Multiplication**: Growth patterns, branching, expansion
