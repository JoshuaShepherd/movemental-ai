## Introduction

The shift from attractional to missional represents a fundamental paradigm change in how the church understands and practices mission. This FAQ addresses common questions about this shift, helping leaders understand what it means to move from a "come and see" approach to a "go and be" approach, and how to integrate missional practice into their contexts. These questions emerge from engagement with church leaders exploring how to recover the church's sentness and engage their communities missionally.

## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is the difference between attractional and missional?

**Answer:** The attractional model assumes the primary task of the church is to attract people to come to church. The focus is on creating compelling programs, services, and events that draw people in. It's a "come and see" approach where we invite people to our buildings, programs, and events.

The missional model recognizes that the church is sent—going to people rather than expecting them to come to us. It's a "go and be" approach where we live among people, embody the gospel in their contexts, and participate in God's mission where we are. The focus shifts from attracting to going, from programs to presence, from events to relationships.

The key difference is direction: attractional brings people to us; missional takes us to people. Attractional assumes people will come if we get our programs right; missional recognizes we must go to people, especially as the church loses its place of honor in society.

### Q2: Does missional mean we abandon all attractional methods?

**Answer:** The missional shift doesn't require abandoning everything that works in the attractional model. The missional future is about integrating both approaches in ways that serve the kingdom. Some people will still come to us, and we should welcome them. But many more will be reached as we go to them, live among them, and serve them in their context.

The shift is about expanding our understanding and approach, not eliminating what works. Attractional methods can still be valuable when integrated within a missional framework. The key is making missional practice primary—going to people—while still welcoming those who come to us.

The question isn't whether to use attractional methods, but what's primary. When missional practice is primary, attractional elements serve the broader mission rather than being the only approach.

### Q3: What is the incarnational principle?

**Answer:** The incarnational principle is at the heart of the missional shift. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14), so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among the people we're called to reach. This means we go to people, live among them, and embody the gospel in their contexts rather than expecting them to come to our contexts.

This principle shapes missional practice in several ways: presence over programs (being with people), relationship over results (investing in people), context over convenience (adapting to people's reality), and service over self (giving ourselves away).

The incarnational principle means we become part of the communities we're called to serve. We don't stay separate and invite people to join us; we join them and share life with them, embodying the gospel in the process.

### Q4: How is this different from just doing outreach or evangelism?

**Answer:** The missional shift is more fundamental than outreach or evangelism. It's about the church's nature as a sent people, not just activities the church does. Mission is not merely an activity of the church; it's the very heartbeat and work of God. We participate in God's mission because we are sent ones.

Outreach and evangelism are often activities we do from our base (the church building) to others. Missional practice involves going to people, living among them, and being the church in their contexts. It's not just sharing the gospel but embodying it, not just inviting people to church but being the church among people.

The difference is identity and presence. Missional practice flows from understanding ourselves as sent ones, living among people as the church, not just doing activities for them from a distance.

### Q5: What about people who want to come to church? Should we turn them away?

**Answer:** Of course not. The missional shift doesn't mean rejecting people who come to us. We should welcome everyone, including those who are drawn to our programs and events. The shift is about expanding our approach, not eliminating welcome.

The key is making missional practice primary while still welcoming those who come. When missional practice is primary, we're going to people even as we welcome those who come. Both approaches serve the mission, but missional practice expands our reach beyond those who will come to us.

The question is balance and priority. Are we only relying on people coming to us, or are we also going to people? Missional practice ensures we're doing both, with going being primary.

### Q6: How do we transition from attractional to missional?

**Answer:** Transitioning requires several shifts: rethinking assumptions about what church is and how it functions, retraining people to see themselves as missionaries rather than just members, restructuring systems to support missional activity, and releasing resources for kingdom expansion rather than institutional maintenance.

The transition involves understanding the church's sentness, equipping people for missional practice, creating structures that support going rather than just gathering, and aligning resources with missional priorities. It's a process that takes time, requiring both understanding and practice.

Key steps include: teaching the missional paradigm, equipping people for missional practice, creating missional communities or expressions, supporting people as they engage their contexts, and integrating missional and attractional approaches effectively.

### Q7: What does missional practice look like practically?

**Answer:** Missional practice looks like: living in neighborhoods and engaging neighbors, participating in workplaces as sent ones, joining communities and serving them, building relationships with people who don't know Jesus, embodying the gospel in specific contexts, creating communities that engage neighborhoods, and being the church where people are.

Practically, this might mean: missional communities living in neighborhoods, workplace engagement as mission, serving communities without expecting return, building relationships over time, creating spaces where people encounter the gospel naturally, and being present in people's lives rather than just inviting them to events.

The key is presence, relationship, and embodiment. We're with people, in relationship with them, embodying the gospel in ways that make sense in their contexts.

### Q8: How does this relate to the early church?

**Answer:** The early church was fundamentally missional. In Acts, we see the church scattering, going to people, and living among them. When persecution scattered the church, it didn't collapse—it multiplied because it was already missional. The church went to people rather than waiting for them to come.

The early church's missional practice included: going to various cities and regions, living among people, adapting to different contexts, embodying the gospel in specific cultures, and multiplying through presence and relationship rather than programs.

The missional shift recovers this early church pattern. We're not inventing something new but recovering what the church was designed to be—a sent people going to the world.

### Q9: What about quality and excellence in programs? Doesn't missional lower standards?

**Answer:** Missional practice doesn't lower standards; it changes what we're excellent at. Instead of excellence in programs that attract people, we pursue excellence in presence, relationship, and embodiment. We're excellent at being with people, serving them, and embodying the gospel in their contexts.

This doesn't mean we abandon quality, but that quality serves a different purpose. Quality programs can still be valuable, but they serve the broader missional purpose rather than being the primary approach. Excellence in missional practice means being excellent at presence, relationship, service, and embodiment.

The standards are different, not lower. We're pursuing excellence in missional engagement rather than just program excellence.

### Q10: How do we measure success in missional practice?

**Answer:** Success in missional practice is measured differently than in attractional approaches. Instead of measuring attendance at programs, we measure: presence in communities, relationships with people who don't know Jesus, engagement in neighborhoods and contexts, communities formed around mission, gospel embodiment in specific contexts, and multiplication through missional engagement.

Quantitative measures might include: number of missional communities, number of relationships with pre-Christians, engagement in neighborhoods, service to communities. Qualitative measures include: depth of relationships, gospel embodiment, community engagement, and multiplication through presence.

The scorecard shifts from "how many came" to "how many are we engaging where they are" and "how well are we embodying the gospel in their contexts."

### Q11: What about theological soundness? Doesn't missional compromise theology?

**Answer:** Missional practice doesn't compromise theology; it grounds theology in practice. The missional shift is theologically grounded in the missio Dei (mission of God), the incarnational principle, and the church's identity as a sent people. It's not about changing theology but about living theology.

Theological soundness in missional practice means: grounding practice in biblical foundations, maintaining theological integrity while adapting to contexts, ensuring gospel fidelity in embodiment, and maintaining connection to theological tradition while engaging contexts.

Theology guides missional practice, ensuring we're embodying the true gospel in ways that honor both the gospel and the contexts we engage.

### Q12: How does this work in different contexts (urban, suburban, rural)?

**Answer:** Missional practice adapts to different contexts while maintaining core principles. In urban contexts, it might mean engaging neighborhoods, workplaces, and communities. In suburban contexts, it might mean engaging schools, communities, and local contexts. In rural contexts, it might mean engaging small communities and local relationships.

The key is adapting the practice to the context while maintaining the core principle of going to people and embodying the gospel where they are. Each context requires understanding that context and engaging it appropriately.

The principles remain the same: presence, relationship, embodiment, service. The application varies by context, requiring cultural intelligence and contextual engagement.

### Q13: What about discipleship in missional practice?

**Answer:** Discipleship happens in missional context. Making disciples involves going to people, engaging them, and forming them in the way of Jesus. Discipleship isn't separate from mission but happens as we engage people missionally.

Missional discipleship includes: forming people in the way of Jesus as we go, making disciples in the context of mission, integrating discipleship and mission, and forming communities around missional practice.

The missional shift doesn't eliminate discipleship but locates it in missional engagement. We make disciples as we go, forming people in the way of Jesus in the context of mission.

### Q14: How do we avoid being too focused on going that we neglect gathering?

**Answer:** The missional shift doesn't eliminate gathering but reorients it. Gathering serves the going. We gather to equip, encourage, and send, then we go to engage missionally. The rhythm is gather-send-gather-send, with gathering serving the sending.

The key is ensuring gathering serves missional practice rather than being an end in itself. When gathering serves going, both are strengthened. We gather to be equipped and encouraged for missional engagement, then we go to engage, then we gather again.

The missional shift changes the purpose of gathering from accumulation to equipping and sending, while still maintaining the importance of gathering for formation and encouragement.

### Q15: What are examples of missional churches or communities?

**Answer:** Examples include: Soma Communities (missional communities in neighborhoods), Forge Mission Training Network (training missional practitioners), various missional communities engaging neighborhoods, workplace churches engaging workplaces, and communities serving specific contexts.

These examples share common characteristics: presence in contexts, relationship with people, service to communities, gospel embodiment, and multiplication through engagement.

Historical examples include: the early church (Acts), Celtic missions, Moravians, and other movements that went to people rather than waiting for them to come.

### Q16: How does this relate to the missional-incarnational impulse in mDNA?

**Answer:** The shift from attractional to missional directly relates to the missional-incarnational impulse, which is one of the six elements of mDNA. This impulse drives sentness (missional) and embodiment (incarnational), combining to create the practice of going to people and dwelling among them.

The missional-incarnational impulse is the DNA-level driver that makes missional practice possible. When this impulse is active, the church naturally goes to people and embodies the gospel. The shift from attractional to missional activates and expresses this impulse.

Understanding this connection helps us see that missional practice isn't just a strategy but flows from the missional DNA that should characterize all Jesus movements.

### Q17: What about the cost? Isn't missional practice more expensive and time-consuming?

**Answer:** Missional practice does require investment, but the question is what we're investing in. Attractional approaches require significant resources for buildings, programs, and events. Missional practice requires investment in relationships, presence, and engagement.

The cost is different, not necessarily greater. Instead of investing primarily in programs and buildings, we invest in people, relationships, and presence. Instead of hiring staff to run programs, we equip people for missional engagement.

The investment shifts from maintaining attractional systems to equipping missional practice. This can actually be more sustainable and multipliable than attractional approaches.

### Q18: How do we maintain unity with a more distributed, missional approach?

**Answer:** Unity in missional practice comes from shared mission, values, and relationships rather than just gathering in one place. When people share a mission and are committed to embodying the gospel in their contexts, unity is maintained through that shared commitment.

Relational connections, shared values, regular gathering for equipping and encouragement, and collective engagement in mission all maintain unity. The unity comes from being the church together, even when distributed across contexts.

The missional shift doesn't eliminate unity but creates it through shared mission and relationships rather than just proximity and programs.

### Q19: What about worship in missional practice?

**Answer:** Worship in missional practice happens in multiple ways: gathering for corporate worship (still important), worship through service and engagement, worship through embodiment of gospel values, and worship that equips for missional engagement.

Corporate worship still matters but serves missional practice. We worship to be formed, equipped, and sent. Worship also happens as we serve, engage, and embody the gospel in our contexts.

The missional shift expands our understanding of worship to include how we live and serve, while maintaining the importance of gathered worship for formation and sending.

### Q20: What's the bottom line—why make this shift?

**Answer:** We make this shift because it aligns the church with its true nature as a sent people. God sent his Son, and the Son sends us. The attractional model, while successful in some contexts, doesn't reflect this fundamental reality. As the church loses its place of honor in society, going to people becomes not just strategic but necessary.

The shift recovers the church's sentness and enables engagement with people who won't come to us. It aligns us with how the early church operated and how God designed the church to function. It enables us to participate more fully in God's mission to sum up all things in Christ.

The bottom line: the church is sent. We can either align with that reality and go to people, or we can resist it and limit our effectiveness. The missional shift is about alignment with who we are and what we're called to be.
