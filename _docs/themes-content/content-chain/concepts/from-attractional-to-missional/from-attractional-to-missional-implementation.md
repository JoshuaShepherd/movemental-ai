## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **What's our primary approach?** Are we primarily attractional (bringing people to us) or missional (going to people)?

2. **Where is our focus?** Is it on programs, events, and buildings, or on presence, relationships, and contexts?

3. **How do we engage our community?** Do we invite people to come, or do we go and engage where they are?

4. **What's our measure of success?** Do we measure attendance and programs, or presence and engagement?

5. **How do people see themselves?** As members who come, or as missionaries who are sent?

6. **Where are we on the continuum?** Primarily attractional, primarily missional, or integrated?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: Missional Readiness Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluates current approach and missional readiness

**How to Use**: 
- Rate each statement 1-5 (1=Strongly Attractional, 5=Strongly Missional)
- Areas scoring 1-2 indicate strong attractional focus
- Areas scoring 4-5 indicate strong missional focus

**Statements**:
1. Our primary approach is going to people rather than bringing people to us
2. We focus on presence and relationships in contexts, not just programs
3. People see themselves as missionaries sent to their contexts
4. We measure engagement and presence, not just attendance
5. We create missional expressions in neighborhoods and contexts
6. Our resources support going, not just gathering
7. We integrate missional and attractional approaches effectively

**Scoring**: 
- 7-14: Strong attractional focus
- 15-21: Mixed, leaning attractional
- 22-28: Mixed, leaning missional
- 29-35: Strong missional focus

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Current approach has been assessed
- [ ] People understand the shift and its importance

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Abandoning Everything Attractional

**Description**: Completely rejecting attractional approaches rather than integrating

**How to Avoid**: Recognize value in both, integrate effectively, maintain welcome for those who come

### Pitfall 2: Not Equipping People

**Description**: Expecting missional practice without equipping

**How to Avoid**: Invest in training, provide resources, offer ongoing support and coaching

### Pitfall 3: Programmatic Missional Approach

**Description**: Making missional another program rather than paradigm shift

**How to Avoid**: Focus on paradigm change, avoid programmatic thinking, emphasize identity and practice

### Pitfall 4: Lack of Integration

**Description**: Tension between missional and attractional rather than integration

**How to Avoid**: Develop integration strategy, see both as valuable, serve the mission through both

### Pitfall 5: Unrealistic Expectations

**Description**: Expecting immediate results from missional shift

**How to Avoid**: Set realistic expectations, allow time for transition, celebrate incremental progress
