## Executive Summary

The shift from attractional to missional represents a fundamental paradigm change in how the church understands and practices mission. The attractional model assumes the primary task is to attract people to come to church—creating compelling programs, services, and events that draw people in. The missional model recognizes that the church is sent—going to people rather than expecting them to come to us. At the heart of this shift is the incarnational principle: just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among the people we're called to reach.

This paradigm shift matters because it aligns the church with its true nature as a sent people. The attractional model, while successful in Christendom contexts, becomes increasingly ineffective as the church loses its place of honor in society. The missional model recovers the church's sentness, calling us to live among those who don't yet know Jesus, embodying the gospel in specific contexts rather than expecting people to come to our programs and buildings.

**Key Points:**
- Attractional: "Come and see" approach, building-centered, program-driven
- Missional: "Go and be" approach, context-centered, relationship-driven
- The shift is paradigmatic, not just methodological
- Incarnational principle: becoming flesh and dwelling among people
- Early church was fundamentally missional, not attractional
- Integration is possible: both/and rather than either/or
- The shift requires rethinking assumptions, retraining people, restructuring systems

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

The shift from attractional to missional represents a fundamental change in the church's understanding of its relationship to the world and its approach to mission. The attractional model assumes the primary task is to attract people to come to church—creating compelling programs, services, and events that draw people in. The missional model recognizes that the church is sent—going to people rather than expecting them to come to us, living among them, embodying the gospel in their contexts.

This shift is not merely methodological but paradigmatic. It changes how we understand the church's nature and purpose. The attractional model assumes the church has a place of honor in society and that people will come if we get our programs right. The missional model recognizes that the church no longer holds that place of honor and must go to people, living among them as sent ones.

At the heart of the missional shift is the incarnational principle: just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among the people we're called to reach. This means presence over programs, relationship over results, context over convenience, and service over self.

The missional future is not about choosing between attractional and missional approaches, but integrating both in ways that serve the kingdom. Some people will still come to us, and we should welcome them. But many more will be reached as we go to them, live among them, and serve them in their context.

### Common Misunderstandings

One misunderstanding is that missional means abandoning all attractional methods. The missional shift doesn't require eliminating everything that works in the attractional model. It's about expanding our understanding and integrating missional approaches. Some people will come to us, and we should welcome them. But the primary focus shifts to going to people.

Another misunderstanding suggests missional is just another evangelism strategy. Missional is more fundamental—it's about the church's nature as a sent people. It changes how we understand church, mission, and our relationship to the world. It's not just a new method but a recovery of the church's true identity.

A third misunderstanding treats missional as primarily about changing Sunday services. The missional shift is more comprehensive, involving how we understand church, how we engage neighborhoods, how we form communities, and how we participate in God's mission. Changing services alone doesn't make a church missional.

A fourth misunderstanding assumes missional means being anti-institutional or anti-structure. Missional churches have structure, but structure serves mission rather than maintenance. The shift is about structure serving sentness rather than accumulation.

### Why It Matters

This shift matters because it aligns the church with its true nature as a sent people. The church exists because God sent his Son, and the Son sends his people. The attractional model, while successful in Christendom contexts, doesn't reflect this fundamental reality. As the church loses its place of honor in society, the attractional model becomes increasingly ineffective.

The missional shift matters because it recovers the church's sentness. When we understand ourselves as sent ones, we naturally go to people rather than expecting them to come to us. We live among them, embody the gospel in their contexts, and participate in God's mission where we are.

This matters because it changes how we engage our neighborhoods and communities. Instead of inviting people to our programs, we go to them, live among them, and serve them. We become part of their communities, engaging them in their contexts rather than expecting them to adapt to ours.

The shift also matters because it addresses the reality that many people won't come to church, no matter how good our programs are. In a post-Christian culture, expecting people to come to us is increasingly unrealistic. Going to them becomes not just strategic but necessary.

### Biblical Foundations

The primary biblical foundation is Jesus' sending of his disciples. In John 20:21, Jesus says, "As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you." This establishes the church as a sent people. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) sends us to make disciples of all nations. Acts 1:8 promises power for witness as we go to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth.

The incarnational principle is foundational. John 1:14 tells us "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us." Philippians 2:5-8 shows Christ's self-emptying and taking the form of a servant. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh and dwell among those we're sent to.

The early church demonstrates missional practice. In Acts, we see the church scattering, going to people, living among them, and embodying the gospel in various contexts. The church doesn't wait for people to come—it goes to them.

The missio Dei (mission of God) provides theological foundation. God is a sending God who sends his Son, and we become sent ones. Mission is not something the church does but something God does, and the church participates in it.

### Theological Framework

The missional shift fits within the framework of the missio Dei—the mission of God. Mission is not an activity of the church but the very heartbeat and work of God. God sends his Son, and we ourselves become a sent people. This sentness is not optional but fundamental to the church's identity.

The incarnational principle provides the theological model. Just as God became flesh and dwelt among us in Christ, so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among those we're sent to. This means embodiment, presence, and participation in specific contexts.

The shift also connects to ecclesiology—our understanding of the church. The church is not a building or institution but a people sent into the world. The church exists for mission, not mission for the church. This changes how we understand church structure, leadership, and practice.

The eschatological vision provides context. God's mission is to sum up all things in Christ (Ephesians 1:10). The missional church participates in this cosmic mission, going into every domain of life and culture to see God's purposes realized.

### Historical Examples

The early church was fundamentally missional. In Acts, we see the church scattering, going to people, and living among them. The church didn't wait for people to come—it went to them, even when persecuted and scattered.

Celtic missions exemplify missional practice. Celtic missionaries went to people, lived among them, learned their languages and cultures, and embodied the gospel in those contexts. They went rather than waiting for people to come.

The Moravians demonstrate missional commitment. They sent missionaries throughout the world, going to people rather than expecting them to come. Their motto "The Lamb's blood alone has power" fueled their missional practice.

Contemporary examples include missional communities that live in neighborhoods, engage workplaces, and participate in communities as sent ones. These expressions go to people, live among them, and embody the gospel in specific contexts.
