## Core Definition

The shift from attractional to missional represents a fundamental paradigm change in how the church understands and practices mission. The attractional model assumes the primary task is to attract people to come to church—creating compelling programs, services, and events that draw people in. The missional model recognizes that the church is sent—going to people rather than expecting them to come to us, living among them, embodying the gospel in their contexts. At the heart of this shift is the incarnational principle: just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among the people we're called to reach.

## Key Points

1. **Attractional Model Characteristics**
   - "Come and see" approach to evangelism
   - Program-driven ministry
   - Event-focused outreach
   - Building-centered activity
   - Professional-led ministry

2. **Missional Model Characteristics**
   - "Go and be" approach to ministry
   - Relationship-driven engagement
   - Community-focused presence
   - Contextual expression
   - Every-member ministry

3. **The Incarnational Principle**
   - Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we become flesh and dwell among people
   - Presence over programs, relationship over results, context over convenience, service over self

4. **Paradigmatic Shift**
   - Not just methodological but fundamental change in understanding
   - Changes how we understand church's nature and purpose
   - Recovers the church's sentness

5. **Integration Possibility**
   - Not either/or but both/and
   - Some people will come to us; many more will be reached as we go to them
   - Integration serves the kingdom effectively

6. **Cultural Reality**
   - Church no longer holds place of honor in society
   - Expecting people to come is increasingly unrealistic
   - Going to people becomes necessary, not just strategic

7. **Biblical Foundation**
   - Jesus sends us: "As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you"
   - Early church was fundamentally missional, going to people
