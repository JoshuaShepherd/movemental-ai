# From Attractional to Missional: Visualization Brief

**Concept**: From Attractional to Missional: The Paradigm Shift in Church Approach  
**Purpose**: Visual communication of the shift from attractional to missional  
**Target Audience**: Designers, content creators, visual communicators  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Concept Overview

The shift from attractional to missional represents a fundamental change in direction and approach. Visual representations must clearly communicate the movement from "come and see" (bringing people to us) to "go and be" (taking us to people). The key visual challenge is showing directional change, the incarnational principle (becoming flesh and dwelling among), and the integration of both approaches. Visuals should emphasize movement, presence, and relationship over programs and events.

## Visual Metaphors

### Direction/Arrow Metaphor

**Description**: Attractional shows arrows pointing inward (people coming to center), missional shows arrows pointing outward (going to people). This visualizes the directional shift clearly.

**Visual Elements**:
- Attractional: Central point (church building) with arrows pointing inward from all directions
- Missional: Central point (church community) with arrows pointing outward in all directions
- People represented around the arrows
- Show movement and direction clearly

**Use Cases**: Direction diagrams, paradigm shift illustrations, movement graphics

### Incarnation/Dwelling Metaphor

**Description**: Show Jesus becoming flesh and dwelling among us, then church becoming flesh and dwelling among people. Visual representation of presence and embodiment.

**Visual Elements**:
- Jesus leaving heaven, becoming human, dwelling among people
- Church leaving its building/programs, going to people, dwelling among them
- Show proximity, presence, relationship
- Contrast with distance, separation, invitation-only approach

**Use Cases**: Incarnational illustrations, presence graphics, relationship visualizations

### Map/Neighborhood Metaphor

**Description**: Attractional shows church as destination (people traveling to it), missional shows church distributed throughout neighborhoods (presence everywhere).

**Visual Elements**:
- Map showing church as single destination with routes to it (attractional)
- Map showing church presence distributed throughout neighborhoods (missional)
- People represented in their contexts
- Show proximity and presence

**Use Cases**: Community engagement diagrams, neighborhood presence maps, distribution graphics

## Diagram Concepts

### Diagram Type 1: Paradigm Shift Comparison

**Purpose**: Side-by-side comparison showing attractional vs. missional approaches

**Structure**:
- Left: Attractional model (come and see, building-centered, program-driven)
- Right: Missional model (go and be, context-centered, relationship-driven)
- Key differences highlighted: direction, focus, method, outcome
- Show integration possibility (both/and)

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Split-screen or side-by-side layout
- Use consistent visual language
- Show direction clearly (inward vs. outward)
- Include integration option showing both approaches working together

**Visual Style**: Clear comparison, directional emphasis, integration shown

### Diagram Type 2: Incarnational Flow

**Purpose**: Show the incarnational process of going and dwelling

**Structure**:
- Starting point: Church/community
- Movement: Going to people/contexts
- Dwelling: Living among, being present
- Engagement: Relationship, service, embodiment
- Outcome: Gospel presence in contexts

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Flow diagram showing the process
- Emphasize movement and presence
- Show contexts and relationships
- Visualize embodiment and engagement

**Visual Style**: Flow diagram, movement emphasis, relationship visualization

## Process Flows

### Transition Process

**Steps**:
1. Recognize need for shift (cultural reality, limited effectiveness)
2. Understand missional paradigm (sentness, incarnational principle)
3. Equip people for missional practice (training, formation)
4. Create missional expressions (communities, engagements)
5. Integrate with attractional approaches (both/and)
6. Measure missional engagement (presence, relationships, multiplication)

**Visual Flow**: Show progression along continuum or through stages, with key transition points and characteristics at each stage

## Comparison Charts

### Attractional vs. Missional Characteristics

**Elements to Compare**:
- Approach: Come and see vs. Go and be
- Focus: Programs/events vs. Presence/relationships
- Location: Building-centered vs. Context-centered
- Method: Invitation vs. Engagement
- Outcome: People coming vs. Gospel presence
- Leadership: Professional-led vs. Every-member
- Measure: Attendance vs. Engagement/Multiplication

**Visual Format**: Comparison table or side-by-side chart with visual indicators

## Infographic Concepts

### Infographic 1: "The Shift"

**Concept**: Visual representation of the directional change from attractional to missional

**Elements**:
- Arrows showing direction change (inward to outward)
- Key characteristics of each approach
- Integration possibility
- Biblical foundation (Jesus sending us)

**Layout**: Clear directional visualization with key points highlighted

### Infographic 2: "Incarnational Principle"

**Concept**: Show Jesus becoming flesh, then church becoming flesh among people

**Elements**:
- Jesus leaving heaven, becoming human, dwelling among us
- Church leaving building, going to people, dwelling among them
- Parallel visualization
- Key principle: presence and embodiment

**Layout**: Parallel flow showing the pattern repeating

### Infographic 3: "Integration Model"

**Concept**: Show how attractional and missional can work together

**Elements**:
- Both approaches represented
- Missional as primary (going to people)
- Attractional as supportive (welcoming those who come)
- Integration serving the kingdom

**Layout**: Integrated model showing both approaches working together

## Color and Symbol Recommendations

### Color Palette

- **Attractional**: Cooler, structured colors (blues, formal tones)
- **Missional**: Warmer, relational colors (oranges, greens, earth tones)
- **Integration**: Blended colors showing combination
- **Movement**: Use dynamic colors and shapes to show activity

### Symbol Recommendations

- **Direction**: Arrows showing movement
- **Presence**: Proximity, closeness, dwelling
- **Relationship**: Connections, networks
- **Incarnation**: Becoming flesh, embodiment
- **Integration**: Blended, combined elements

---

## Layout Suggestions

### For Presentations

- Use directional arrows consistently
- Show movement and presence
- Include integration models
- Use maps/neighborhood visualizations

### For Print Materials

- Clear comparison diagrams
- Flow charts showing process
- Neighborhood/context maps
- Integration models

### For Digital/Interactive

- Interactive directional diagrams
- Animated transitions showing shift
- Interactive neighborhood maps
- Integration tool showing both approaches

## Key Visual Principles

1. **Direction Matters**: Clearly show directional change (inward vs. outward)
2. **Presence Over Programs**: Emphasize presence, relationship, embodiment
3. **Integration Possible**: Show both/and possibility, not just either/or
4. **Movement and Activity**: Show going, engaging, being present
5. **Context-Centered**: Show church in contexts, not just contexts coming to church
6. **Incarnational**: Visualize becoming flesh and dwelling among
