## Questions

### Q1: What does "Jesus is Lord" mean in practical terms?

**Answer**: When we confess "Jesus is Lord," we are making a comprehensive claim about the rule of Christ over every aspect of our lives. This is not merely a statement of personal devotion or a theological affirmation about Jesus's divinity. It is the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed that shapes every decision, every action, every relationship.

In practical terms, this means that Jesus has the right to rule over our work, our family, our politics, our economics, our culture. There is no area of life that exists outside his lordship. The lordship of Jesus provides the organizing principle for all of life. We go where Jesus leads, we do what Jesus commands, we become what Jesus intends.

This practical lordship manifests itself through complete allegiance, simple faith, transformative power, missional clarity, and persecution resistance. When Jesus is truly Lord, everything else falls into place. The other elements of mDNA—discipleship, incarnational mission, liminality-communitas, APEST culture, and organic systems—all flow naturally from this central reality.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus is comprehensive, affecting every aspect of life
- It provides the organizing principle for all decisions and actions
- It creates the conditions for authentic discipleship and missional engagement
- All other mDNA elements flow from this central reality

**Examples**:
- The early church's refusal to acknowledge Caesar as lord demonstrated the practical implications of this confession
- The Chinese underground church's growth from 2 million to 120 million shows the power of this simple confession lived out faithfully

### Q2: How does this differ from simply believing in Jesus?

**Answer**: Believing in Jesus and confessing "Jesus is Lord" are related but distinct. Belief can be intellectual assent—acknowledging that Jesus exists, that he is the Son of God, that he died and rose again. But the confession "Jesus is Lord" goes far beyond intellectual belief. It is a comprehensive commitment that brings all of life under the rule of Christ.

The difference lies in the scope and depth of the commitment. Belief can be compartmentalized—we can believe in Jesus while keeping other areas of life separate. But the lordship of Jesus is comprehensive—it claims every aspect of our existence. There is no room for competing loyalties, no area that exists outside his rule.

In biblical faith, salvation and lordship are inextricably linked. We cannot receive Jesus as Savior without receiving him as Lord. The confession "Jesus is Lord" is essential to salvation (Romans 10:9), but it is also the ongoing reality that shapes our lives. It is not a one-time decision but a daily reality that reorients everything around the lordship of Christ.

**Key Points**:
- Belief can be intellectual assent; lordship is comprehensive commitment
- The lordship of Jesus claims every aspect of life, not just the "religious" parts
- Salvation and lordship are inextricably linked in biblical faith
- Lordship is an ongoing reality, not just a one-time decision

**Examples**:
- Many people believe in Jesus but live as if other things are more important
- The early church's willingness to die for this confession shows it was more than mere belief

### Q3: What does it mean to bring all of life under the lordship of Jesus?

**Answer**: Bringing all of life under the lordship of Jesus means eliminating the false dichotomy between sacred and secular. There is no such thing as sacred and secular in the biblical worldview. It can conceive of no part of the world that does not come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. All life belongs to God, and true holiness means bringing all the spheres of our life under God.

This means that our work, our family, our politics, our economics, our culture—all of it—belongs to God and must be brought under his rule. The Hebraic perspective draws a direct correlation from any and every aspect of life to the eternal purposes of God. This is the intrinsic logic of the Torah. It is a natural extension of the claim of monotheism—namely, that Yahweh is Lord of all of life and not just the "religious zone."

In practical terms, this means we evaluate every decision, every action, every relationship in light of Jesus's lordship. We ask: "Would Jesus be doing this if he were here?" We remove activities not aligned with his mission. We eliminate unnecessary clutter. We realign every aspect of life around Jesus—personally and communally.

**Key Points**:
- There is no sacred-secular divide in the biblical worldview
- All of life belongs to God and must be brought under his rule
- This means evaluating every decision and action in light of Jesus's lordship
- It requires eliminating activities not aligned with his mission

**Examples**:
- Aligning vocation and career under the lordship of Jesus
- Holding a monthly "buy nothing day" to break the power of consumerism
- Sharing credit card statements for accountability in financial stewardship

### Q4: How do we avoid making Jesus "personal" rather than recognizing his comprehensive lordship?

**Answer**: The temptation to make Jesus "personal" rather than recognizing his comprehensive lordship is a subtle but dangerous distortion. When we make Jesus "personal," we treat him as a convenient deity available for protection and blessing but not demanding total allegiance. He becomes "our own personal Jesus"—tucked away in the corner, useful when needed, but not claiming the totality of our lives.

The story of Micah from Judges 17 illustrates this temptation. Micah sets up a private shrine in his house, where he worships idols and installs his own personal priest. This attitude describes much of contemporary Christianity, where Jesus doesn't lay claim to the totality of a believer's life but just blesses their current behavior and offers protection in the life to come.

To avoid this, we must recognize that Jesus is not our own personal Jesus—he is the King of the universe, and he asks for our total allegiance. We must shape our life and spirituality on Jesus, investigating his spirituality as a group and comparing our own to it. We must regularly evaluate all communal activities: "Would Jesus be doing this if he were here?" We must remove activities not aligned with his mission and eliminate unnecessary clutter.

**Key Points**:
- Making Jesus "personal" treats him as convenient rather than comprehensive
- We must recognize Jesus as King of the universe, not just our personal savior
- This requires evaluating all activities in light of Jesus's mission
- We must remove activities not aligned with his lordship

**Examples**:
- The story of Micah and his personal Levite illustrates the danger
- Regularly asking "Would Jesus be doing this?" helps avoid this pitfall

### Q5: What is the relationship between the Shema and "Jesus is Lord"?

**Answer**: The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) represents Israel's basic confession: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one." This declaration, in the context of ancient polytheism, established the foundation of practical monotheism—the claim that one God rules over every aspect of life. When the early church proclaimed "Jesus is Lord," they made the same claim and with the same implications that Israel proclaimed God as Lord in the Shema.

The fundamental religious situation hadn't shifted all that much. Polytheism was still the dominant religious force in the time of the early church, as it is in ours. The names of the gods had changed from those of Canaanite ones (Baal, Ashteroth, etc.) to Greco-Roman ones (Venus, Diana, Apollo, etc.) and from there to romantic love, consumerism, ideologies, and self-help religion in our day, but in essence the confession has the same claim and impact.

When Jesus affirmed the Shema as the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34), he was connecting his own mission to this foundational truth. His teaching on the kingdom of God represents another way of expressing the claim of the one God over all creation. The incarnation does not alter the fundamental practical monotheism of the Scriptures; rather, it restructures monotheism around Jesus Christ. He becomes the focus of our attention and the pivotal point in our relationship to God.

**Key Points**:
- The Shema establishes the foundation of practical monotheism
- "Jesus is Lord" makes the same claim with the same implications
- Jesus connected his mission to the Shema when he affirmed it as the greatest commandment
- The incarnation restructures monotheism around Jesus without altering its fundamental nature

**Examples**:
- Both confessions claim exclusive loyalty to one God
- Both exclude all competing claims to ultimate allegiance
- Both demand comprehensive commitment, not compartmentalized religion

### Q6: How does practical monotheism differ from philosophical monotheism?

**Answer**: Practical monotheism, or what Alan calls "existential monotheism," differs fundamentally from philosophical monotheism. Philosophical monotheism is primarily a statement about God's eternal being in essential oneness—a metaphysical claim about the nature of God. But biblical monotheism, as the biblical players experienced it, is an existential claim that there is only one God and he is Lord of every aspect of life.

The Hebraic perspective on monotheism is concrete and practical. It is not primarily a statement about God as eternal being in essential oneness, as it was for the Hellenist theologians, but rather it is an existential claim that there is only one God and he is Lord of every aspect of life—it's all about the covenant King. The Shema is a call to covenant loyalty, rather than being a statement of theological ontology.

The philosopher poses the question of the nature of God in a form quite alien to the outlook of the biblical writers. The philosopher makes the problem one of intellect rather than of action; he or she views the problem speculatively, seeking objective understanding of a concept of God rather than existentially to grow in personal involvement with God.

To those who claim the name of Jesus, only one power is sovereign—the God we encounter in the Lord Jesus Christ. And we are called to respond with our lives. Christian belief does not consist in merely saying "There is One God." The devil knows that. Christians respond to their God by faith in his deeds, trust in his power, hope in his promise, and passionate abandonment of self to do his will.

**Key Points**:
- Philosophical monotheism is about God's eternal being; practical monotheism is about God's comprehensive lordship
- Biblical monotheism is an existential claim, not a metaphysical speculation
- It requires a response of faith, trust, hope, and passionate abandonment
- It is about covenant loyalty, not theological ontology

**Examples**:
- The Shema calls for covenant loyalty, not just intellectual assent
- The early church's willingness to die shows this was existential, not philosophical

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Metanoia

### Q7: What does it mean to say there is no sacred-secular divide?

**Answer**: Saying there is no sacred-secular divide means recognizing that all of life belongs to God and must be brought under his lordship. The biblical worldview can conceive of no part of the world that does not come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. While in the Western spiritual tradition we have tended to see the "religious" as one category of life among many (we even call nuns and monks the "religious"), the Hebrew mind has no such distinction about a purely "religious" existence but is concerned with all of life.

All of life is sacred when it is placed in relationship to the living God. The Hebraic perspective draws a direct correlation from any and every aspect of life to the eternal purposes of God. This is the intrinsic logic of the Torah. It is a natural extension of the claim of monotheism—namely, that Yahweh is Lord of all of life and not just the "religious zone."

In practical terms, this means we hallow the everyday. We discuss how ordinary tasks can be made holy—cleaning, shopping, working, eating, recreation. We define holiness by what we do to hallow the everyday, not what we abstain from. We regularly affirm that all of life is sacred. We develop a theology that redeems pleasure and passion, tracing them back to God.

**Key Points**:
- All of life belongs to God and is sacred when placed in relationship to him
- The Hebrew mind has no distinction between "religious" and "non-religious" existence
- We must hallow the everyday, making ordinary tasks holy
- Holiness is defined by what we do to hallow the everyday, not what we abstain from

**Examples**:
- Eating: Practice thankfulness, moderation, generosity; include the poor or lonely
- Recreation: Use time to serve, reflect on God, connect with others
- Work: Align vocation and career under the lordship of Jesus

### Q8: How does the lordship of Jesus relate to the kingdom of God?

**Answer**: The kingdom of God can be seen as "the business, or working, end" of the claim of the One God over all of life. The New Testament writers' use of the phrase "the kingdom of God" is another way of saying that God is One, that he is King, and that he claims all and rules over all. When Jesus says "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well" (Matthew 6:33), he is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema.

The kingdom is God's claim on us—it is the "business end" of the reign of Jesus over all life. Many miss this because we don't understand monotheism the way first-century Jews did. While there might be a difference of opinion over Jesus's use of this phrase, most scholars agree that the kingdom of God refers to the active reign of God everywhere and over everyone. It is the activity of God in all spheres of life, especially in the church, but also well beyond it.

The kingdom of God is not primarily about a future realm or a place we go after death. It is about the active reign of God in the present, the comprehensive claim of Jesus over all of life. When we seek first the kingdom, we are bringing all of life under the lordship of Jesus. We are aligning ourselves with the rule of God that is breaking into the world through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

**Key Points**:
- The kingdom of God is the "business end" of the lordship of Jesus
- It refers to the active reign of God everywhere and over everyone
- It is about the present reality of God's rule, not just a future realm
- Seeking the kingdom means bringing all of life under the lordship of Jesus

**Examples**:
- Jesus's teaching on seeking first the kingdom connects to the Shema's call for comprehensive loyalty
- The kingdom is the practical outworking of the lordship of Jesus in every sphere of life

### Q9: Why is "Jesus is Lord" considered the foundational element of mDNA?

**Answer**: "Jesus is Lord" is considered the foundational element of mDNA because it is the organizing center from which all other elements flow. It is not merely one element among others, but the gravitational force that shapes everything else. When movements recover this simple yet profound truth, they unlock the transformative power that lies at the heart of the Christian faith.

All genuine Christian movements involve at their spiritual ground zero a living encounter with the one true God "through whom all things came and through whom we live" (1 Corinthians 8:6), a God who in the very moment of redeeming us claims us as his own through Jesus our Savior. If we fail to apprehend this spiritual center, we can never fully understand movements or reinvoke the power that infused their lives and communities.

The other elements of mDNA—disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and liminality-communitas—all find their proper orientation when Jesus is truly Lord. Disciple making flows from the lordship of Jesus—we become like the one who is Lord. Missional engagement is rooted in his lordship and mission. Apostolic leadership functions under his authority. Organic systems emerge when Jesus is truly Lord. Intense community forms when people share the mission of the one who is Lord.

**Key Points**:
- Jesus is Lord is the organizing center from which all other elements flow
- It is the gravitational force that shapes everything else
- All other mDNA elements find their proper orientation when Jesus is truly Lord
- Movements that recover this truth unlock transformative power

**Examples**:
- The Chinese underground church's growth shows the power of this foundational element
- The early church's transformation of the Roman Empire demonstrates this foundational truth

**Related Concepts**: mDNA, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Environment, Organic Systems, Liminality-Communitas

### Q10: How did the early church's confession "Jesus is Lord" create conflict with Rome?

**Answer**: The early church's confession "Jesus is Lord" created direct conflict with the Roman Empire because it challenged Caesar's claim to ultimate loyalty. In Roman theology, Caesar was a physical manifestation of a god that claimed total allegiance. Furthermore, it was the political genius of Rome to gather all the other gods of the subjugated nations and bring them under the lordship of Caesar and so create a religion that lent a deeper religious unity to the diverse political empire.

A people group could keep its tribal gods only as long as the people were willing to acknowledge that Caesar was lord over them. The fact that they were a conquered people indicated that the Roman god was supreme, so the people generally submitted—except for Jews and Christians.

The early church rejected this claim. The early Christians refused to see Jesus as merely part of Rome's pantheon of the gods. The confession "Jesus is Lord" became in their mouths a deeply subversive claim that effectively undermined the rule of Caesar and all other absolute claims to political lordship. The emperors understood this all too clearly; hence the terrible persecutions that followed.

But the point is that our spiritual forebears really understood the inner meaning of monotheism here. They knew that Jesus is Lord and that this lordship effectively excluded all other claims to ultimate loyalty. They knew that this was the heart of the faith, and they could not, would not, surrender it.

**Key Points**:
- Caesar claimed to be lord, creating direct conflict with the confession "Jesus is Lord"
- The early church refused to acknowledge Caesar as lord, choosing persecution instead
- This confession was deeply subversive, undermining all other claims to political lordship
- The early Christians understood that this lordship excluded all other claims to ultimate loyalty

**Examples**:
- The persecutions under Nero, Domitian, and other emperors
- The willingness of early Christians to die rather than deny this confession

### Q11: How does the lordship of Jesus provide missional clarity?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus provides missional clarity by establishing the foundation for mission. We are sent into the world as those who belong to Jesus, who represent his kingdom, who bear witness to his lordship. Mission flows from the recognition that Jesus is Lord of all, and therefore all must hear and respond to this claim.

When Jesus is truly Lord, we go where Jesus leads, we do what Jesus commands, we become what Jesus intends. The lordship of Jesus provides clear direction for mission because it establishes our identity, our purpose, and our practice. We are not sent on our own mission, but on the mission of the one who is Lord.

This missional clarity manifests itself in several ways. First, it clarifies our identity—we are those who belong to Jesus and represent his kingdom. Second, it clarifies our purpose—we are sent to bear witness to his lordship. Third, it clarifies our practice—we engage in mission as those who are under the authority of the one who is Lord.

The lordship of Jesus also provides missional clarity by eliminating competing claims. When Jesus is truly Lord, there are no other claims that can distract us from mission. We are not divided in our loyalties, but single-minded in our commitment to the one who is Lord.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus establishes the foundation for mission
- We are sent as those who belong to Jesus and represent his kingdom
- It clarifies our identity, purpose, and practice
- It eliminates competing claims that could distract from mission

**Examples**:
- The early church's mission to the ends of the earth flowed from this confession
- Contemporary missional movements find clarity when Jesus is truly Lord

### Q12: What role does the lordship of Jesus play in persecution resistance?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus plays a crucial role in persecution resistance because it provides the foundation for willingness to suffer. When Jesus is truly Lord, believers are willing to endure persecution rather than deny their essential confession. This was true of the early church facing Rome, the Chinese underground church facing communism, and it remains true for believers facing any form of opposition today.

The lordship of Jesus creates this resistance because it establishes what is ultimate. When Jesus is truly Lord, there is nothing that can take his place. No threat, no persecution, no suffering can displace the one who is Lord. This creates a resilience that enables believers to stand firm even in the face of death.

This resistance is not about being stubborn or obstinate. It is about recognizing that the lordship of Jesus is the heart of the faith, and it cannot be surrendered. The early Christians understood that to deny "Jesus is Lord" was to deny the very essence of Christianity. They knew that this was the heart of the faith, and they could not, would not, surrender it.

The lordship of Jesus also provides persecution resistance by creating intense community. When people share the mission of the one who is Lord, they form bonds that can withstand persecution. This is the liminality-communitas that forms when people are willing to suffer together for the sake of the one who is Lord.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus provides the foundation for willingness to suffer
- It establishes what is ultimate, creating resilience in the face of persecution
- It cannot be surrendered because it is the heart of the faith
- It creates intense community that can withstand persecution

**Examples**:
- The early church's willingness to die for this confession
- The Chinese underground church's growth despite persecution

**Related Concepts**: Liminality-Communitas, Disciple Making

### Q13: How does the lordship of Jesus relate to salvation?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus is inextricably linked to salvation in biblical faith. We cannot receive Jesus as Savior without receiving him as Lord. The confession "Jesus is Lord" is essential to salvation (Romans 10:9), but it is also the ongoing reality that shapes our lives. It is not a one-time decision but a daily reality that reorients everything around the lordship of Christ.

Yahweh's lordship is at once complete and graceful salvation as well as total, unqualified demand. In biblical faith, salvation and lordship are inextricably linked. The redemptive work of Christ establishes his claim over our lives. We are saved by grace through faith, but this salvation brings us under the lordship of the one who saved us.

This linkage is not about earning salvation through obedience. It is about recognizing that salvation and lordship are two sides of the same reality. When we are saved, we are brought under the lordship of the one who saved us. When we confess "Jesus is Lord," we are acknowledging both his saving work and his ongoing rule.

The lordship of Jesus also relates to salvation by providing the foundation for transformation. When Jesus is truly Lord, we are transformed into his image. This transformation is not just about personal piety, but about comprehensive discipleship that brings all of life under his rule.

**Key Points**:
- Salvation and lordship are inextricably linked in biblical faith
- We cannot receive Jesus as Savior without receiving him as Lord
- The lordship of Jesus is both the means and the result of salvation
- It provides the foundation for transformation into Christ's image

**Examples**:
- Romans 10:9 connects confession of Jesus as Lord to salvation
- The early church's understanding of salvation included comprehensive lordship

### Q14: What does it mean to "distill the message" to "Jesus is Lord"?

**Answer**: To "distill the message" to "Jesus is Lord" means removing all unnecessary complexities and returning to the essential truth. When persecuted Jesus movements are driven underground, they are forced to jettison all unnecessary impediments, including all unwieldy conceptions and practices of ecclesia. They must condense and purify their core message that keeps them both faithful and hopeful.

The result is a recovery of the power of their core message. Faith is once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus, the Author and Completer of the faith. At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple Christology (essential conceptions of who Jesus is and what he does), yet one that accurately reflects the Jesus of New Testament faith.

This distillation also unleashes the capacity to rapidly transfer the message along relational lines. Freed from the philosophical density of academic language and from dependence on the professional cleric, the gospel becomes profoundly "sneezable." This reference to sneezing is not just whimsical. We know from the study of ideas that they spread in patterns very similar to that of viral epidemics. In order to really take hold and become an "epidemic," they have to be easily transferred from one person to another.

**Key Points**:
- Distilling the message means removing unnecessary complexities
- It returns to the essential truth of Jesus as Lord
- This simplicity allows the message to be easily transferred
- It unlocks the transformative power of the gospel

**Examples**:
- The Chinese underground church's growth shows the power of this distillation
- The early church's rapid expansion demonstrates this principle

### Q15: How does the lordship of Jesus create the conditions for authentic discipleship?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus creates the conditions for authentic discipleship by establishing the foundation for transformation. When Jesus is truly Lord, discipleship becomes a natural response to his claim on our lives. We are compelled to become like him, to follow him, to serve him. This is not about programs or techniques, but about a living relationship with the one who claims us as his own.

The lordship of Jesus provides the organizing principle for discipleship. We become like the one who is Lord. We follow the one who is Lord. We serve the one who is Lord. This creates a clear direction and purpose for discipleship that goes beyond mere information transfer or skill development.

The lordship of Jesus also creates the conditions for authentic discipleship by eliminating competing claims. When Jesus is truly Lord, there are no other masters that can distract us from discipleship. We are not divided in our loyalties, but single-minded in our commitment to the one who is Lord.

This discipleship is comprehensive, affecting every aspect of life. It is not limited to the "religious" aspects, but encompasses work, family, politics, economics, culture. When Jesus is truly Lord, all of life becomes the context for discipleship.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus establishes the foundation for transformation
- It provides the organizing principle for discipleship
- It eliminates competing claims that could distract from discipleship
- It creates comprehensive discipleship that affects every aspect of life

**Examples**:
- The early church's transformation shows the power of this discipleship
- Contemporary missional movements demonstrate this comprehensive approach

### Q16: What is the relationship between "Jesus is Lord" and the incarnation?

**Answer**: The incarnation does not alter the fundamental practical monotheism of the Scriptures; rather, it restructures monotheism around Jesus Christ. He becomes the focus of our attention and the pivotal point in our relationship to God. We adhere to him—he not only initiates the new covenant; he is the New Covenant.

The incarnation reveals the lordship of Jesus in a new way. Through the incarnation, we see what it means for God to be Lord. We see the lordship of Jesus demonstrated in his life, his death, and his resurrection. The incarnation shows us that the lordship of Jesus is not about power and domination, but about service and sacrifice.

The incarnation also establishes the foundation for the lordship of Jesus. Through the incarnation, Jesus demonstrates his authority over all things. He heals the sick, casts out demons, calms the storm, raises the dead. These acts demonstrate his lordship over creation, over evil, over death itself.

The incarnation also shows us how to live under the lordship of Jesus. Jesus's life becomes the model for our own. We see in him what it means to bring all of life under the lordship of God. We see in him the integration of all aspects of life under the rule of the one who is Lord.

**Key Points**:
- The incarnation restructures monotheism around Jesus Christ
- It reveals the lordship of Jesus in a new way
- It establishes the foundation for the lordship of Jesus
- It shows us how to live under the lordship of Jesus

**Examples**:
- Jesus's life demonstrates what it means for God to be Lord
- The incarnation shows the lordship of Jesus through service and sacrifice

### Q17: How does the lordship of Jesus relate to worship?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus relates to worship by establishing what worship truly is. Biblical worship is not confined to certain times or places but is to infuse all of life. Worship is "offering our world back to God" (Alan Hirsch). This comprehensive understanding of worship flows directly from the lordship of Jesus.

When Jesus is truly Lord, all of life becomes an act of worship. Our work, our family, our politics, our economics, our culture—all of it—becomes an offering to the one who is Lord. This is what it means to love God with all of our hearts, minds, and strength.

The lordship of Jesus also redefines worship by eliminating the false distinction between sacred and secular. There is no such thing as sacred and secular in the biblical worldview. All of life is sacred when it is placed in relationship to the living God. When Jesus is truly Lord, every aspect of life becomes an act of worship.

This comprehensive worship includes loving others, obeying Jesus, lingering in God's presence, speaking about God, longing for Christ's return, forsaking other gods and idols, laying down our lives, and loving creation. All of these are ways we worship the one who is Lord.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus establishes what worship truly is
- When Jesus is Lord, all of life becomes an act of worship
- It eliminates the false distinction between sacred and secular
- Comprehensive worship includes many different expressions

**Examples**:
- Loving others is an act of worship
- Obeying Jesus is an act of worship
- Laying down our lives is an act of worship

### Q18: What does it mean to say that "Jesus is Lord" is the gravitational center?

**Answer**: To say that "Jesus is Lord" is the gravitational center means that it is the organizing principle that shapes everything else. Just as gravity holds the solar system together, the lordship of Jesus holds the missional movement together. It is the force that draws everything toward itself, the center around which everything else orbits.

This gravitational center reshapes our people into a movement. When we receive that indicative—that Jesus is Lord—we are compelled toward a communal imperative: practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood. This gravitational pull creates coherence and direction for the movement.

The lordship of Jesus as gravitational center means that all other elements of mDNA find their proper orientation when Jesus is truly Lord. Disciple making, missional engagement, apostolic leadership, organic systems, and intense community all orbit around this central reality. Without this center, the movement fragments and loses coherence.

This gravitational center also provides stability and resilience. When movements face persecution or opposition, the lordship of Jesus provides the anchor that holds them firm. It is the unshakable foundation that cannot be moved, no matter what forces come against it.

**Key Points**:
- The lordship of Jesus is the organizing principle that shapes everything else
- It reshapes our people into a movement
- All other mDNA elements orbit around this central reality
- It provides stability and resilience in the face of opposition

**Examples**:
- The early church's coherence despite persecution
- The Chinese underground church's growth despite opposition

**Related Concepts**: mDNA, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

### Q19: How does the lordship of Jesus relate to the fivefold ministry (APEST)?

**Answer**: The lordship of Jesus relates to the fivefold ministry (APEST) by establishing the foundation and authority for these gifts. The fivefold ministry functions under the lordship of Christ, who gives gifts to his people for the building up of the body. These gifts—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching—operate under his authority and for his purposes.

When Jesus is truly Lord, the fivefold ministry finds its proper orientation. These gifts are not about personal advancement or institutional power, but about serving the one who is Lord. They are expressions of his lordship, ways in which he builds up his people and extends his kingdom.

The lordship of Jesus also provides the context for the fivefold ministry. These gifts function best when Jesus is truly Lord, when the community is centered on him, when his mission is the organizing principle. Without the lordship of Jesus, these gifts can be distorted or misused.

The lordship of Jesus also establishes the purpose of the fivefold ministry. These gifts are given to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ, to extend the kingdom of the one who is Lord. They are not ends in themselves, but means by which the lordship of Jesus is expressed and extended.

**Key Points**:
- The fivefold ministry functions under the lordship of Christ
- These gifts operate under his authority and for his purposes
- They function best when Jesus is truly Lord
- They are means by which the lordship of Jesus is expressed and extended

**Examples**:
- The early church's use of these gifts under the lordship of Jesus
- Contemporary missional movements that center on Jesus's lordship

### Q20: What is the first step in recovering Apostolic Genius?

**Answer**: The first step in recovering Apostolic Genius is the recovery of the lordship of Jesus in its utter simplicity. This is not about adding another program or initiative to our church life. It is about rediscovering the very heart of what it means to be Christian. When Jesus is truly Lord, everything else falls into place.

This recovery begins with a fresh perspective on Jesus. We must pursue a renewed understanding of Jesus's life and mission. We must approach Jesus anew, setting aside institutional perspectives to focus on the core truths of Christ and his gospel. We must recognize that the first followers understood Jesus through a Jewish lens; we must study Jesus's heritage and context to refresh our Christology.

This recovery also requires getting over dualism. We must realign every aspect of life around Jesus—personally and communally. We must identify and confess idols and develop practices to break their power. We must hallow the everyday, making ordinary tasks holy.

This recovery also requires making the Gospels the primary text. To keep Jesus at our collective core, the Gospels must be our primary texts. While we honor all scripture, we read it through the lens of Jesus. We must focus deeply on the central teachings of Jesus, especially the parables and the Sermon on the Mount.

**Key Points**:
- The first step is recovering the lordship of Jesus in its utter simplicity
- This requires a fresh perspective on Jesus
- It requires getting over dualism
- It requires making the Gospels the primary text

**Examples**:
- The Chinese underground church's recovery of this simple truth
- The early church's centering on Jesus's lordship
