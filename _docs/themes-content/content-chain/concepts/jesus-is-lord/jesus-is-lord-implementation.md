# Jesus is Lord: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Jesus is Lord  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for recovering and implementing the lordship of Jesus in community life  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers, missional communities  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for recovering and implementing the lordship of Jesus as the organizing center of missional movement. The lordship of Jesus is not a program to implement but a reality to recover—the foundational truth that shapes every aspect of community life. This guide walks through the process of distilling the message to its essence, eliminating competing loyalties, and bringing all of life under the rule of Christ.

Whether you are starting a new missional community or seeking to renew an existing one, this guide offers concrete steps for making Jesus truly Lord. The process involves assessment, recovery, integration, and transformation. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive approach to recovering this foundational truth.

This guide is designed for communities that are serious about becoming Jesus movements. It requires commitment, courage, and a willingness to let go of anything that competes with the lordship of Jesus. The reward is the transformative power that comes when Jesus is truly Lord—the same power that transformed the early church and the Chinese underground movement.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **Is Jesus truly the organizing center of your community?** 
   - Do major decisions begin with asking "What would Jesus do?"
   - Is Jesus mentioned and referenced in all aspects of community life?
   - Would an outsider recognize Jesus as the center of your community?

2. **Are there competing loyalties?**
   - What other "lords" compete for allegiance in your community?
   - Are there areas of life that exist outside Jesus's lordship?
   - What idols need to be identified and removed?

3. **Is there a sacred-secular divide?**
   - Do you treat some areas of life as "religious" and others as "secular"?
   - Are there parts of life that are not brought under Jesus's lordship?
   - How integrated is faith with daily life?

4. **How simple is your message?**
   - Can you explain the core of your faith in simple terms?
   - Is the message easily transferable from person to person?
   - Have you removed unnecessary complexities?

5. **What is the quality of your discipleship?**
   - Are people becoming more like Jesus?
   - Is discipleship comprehensive, affecting all of life?
   - Is there evidence of transformation?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: The Lordship Inventory

**Purpose**: Identify areas of life that are and are not under the lordship of Jesus

**How to Use**: 
1. List all major areas of life (work, family, finances, recreation, relationships, etc.)
2. For each area, rate on a scale of 1-5 how fully it is under Jesus's lordship
3. Identify areas scoring 3 or below as needing attention
4. Develop specific action plans for each area

**Scoring**: 
- 5 = Fully under Jesus's lordship
- 4 = Mostly under Jesus's lordship
- 3 = Partially under Jesus's lordship
- 2 = Rarely under Jesus's lordship
- 1 = Not under Jesus's lordship

#### Tool 2: The Idol Identification Exercise

**Purpose**: Identify competing "lords" that need to be dethroned

**How to Use**:
1. Reflect on what consumes your time, energy, and resources
2. Identify what you would be unwilling to give up for Jesus
3. List what you turn to for security, identity, and meaning
4. Confess these as idols and develop practices to break their power

**Scoring**: The presence of any idols indicates areas where Jesus is not fully Lord

#### Tool 3: The Message Simplicity Test

**Purpose**: Assess how easily your core message can be transferred

**How to Use**:
1. Write your core message in one sentence
2. Test it with someone outside your community
3. Ask if they can understand and explain it back to you
4. Simplify until it passes the test

**Scoring**: If the message cannot be easily understood and transferred, it needs simplification
