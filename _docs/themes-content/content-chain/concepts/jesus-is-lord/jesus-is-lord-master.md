## Executive Summary

Jesus is Lord stands as the organizing center and gravitational force of all missional movement. This foundational confession represents the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed that shapes every aspect of existence. When movements recover this simple yet profound truth, they unlock the transformative power that lies at the heart of the Christian faith.

At its core, "Jesus is Lord" is the New Testament expression of Israel's primal confession in the Shema: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one." This practical monotheism—what Alan calls "existential monotheism"—means that there is only one God who is Lord over all creation, and this lordship excludes all other claims to ultimate loyalty. The confession reverberates with the deepest currents of biblical revelation, touching the nature of God, his relation to the world as King, and his covenantal claim over every aspect of our lives.

**Key Points:**
- Jesus is Lord is the foundational element of mDNA, the gravitational center that reshapes people into movements
- This confession represents practical monotheism—the claim that one God rules over every aspect of life
- The lordship of Jesus excludes all competing loyalties and demands complete allegiance
- When movements distill their message to this essence, they unlock transformative power
- This confession connects to Israel's Shema and represents the covenant claim of God over his people
- The lordship of Jesus provides missional clarity, persecution resistance, and spiritual authority
- All other mDNA elements flow naturally from this central reality

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Jesus is Lord represents the organizing center and gravitational force of all missional movement. This foundational confession is the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed that shapes every aspect of existence. When the early church proclaimed "Jesus is Lord," they made the same claim and with the same implications that Israel proclaimed God as Lord in the Shema. This confession touches the deepest currents of biblical revelation: the nature of God, his relation to the world as King, and his covenantal claim over every aspect of our lives, both individual and communal.

The lordship of Jesus is not merely a theological proposition but a living reality that shapes every aspect of life and ministry. It represents practical monotheism—what Alan calls "existential monotheism"—the belief that there is only one God who is Lord over all creation, and this lordship excludes all other claims to ultimate loyalty. This is the "business end" of the claim of the one God over all of life, the working out of God's kingdom in every sphere of existence.

In authentic Jesus movements, this lordship manifests itself through complete allegiance, simple faith, transformative power, missional clarity, and persecution resistance. When movements recover this central truth, they discover that everything else falls into place. The other elements of mDNA—discipleship, incarnational mission, liminality-communitas, APEST culture, and organic systems—all flow naturally from this central reality.

### Common Misunderstandings

Many contemporary Christians misunderstand "Jesus is Lord" as merely a statement of personal devotion or a theological affirmation about Jesus's divinity. They reduce it to a private spiritual matter that affects only the "religious" aspects of life. This compartmentalization misses the comprehensive claim that lordship represents.

Others view it as a political statement disconnected from daily life, or as a doctrinal position that requires intellectual assent but not practical obedience. Some treat Jesus as "their own personal Jesus"—a convenient deity available for protection and blessing but not demanding total allegiance.

The biblical understanding of "Jesus is Lord" is far more radical. It is not about adding Jesus to an existing life structure, but about restructuring all of life around Jesus. It is not about Jesus blessing our current behavior, but about Jesus claiming every aspect of our existence. It is not about compartmentalized religion, but about comprehensive discipleship that brings all of life under the lordship of Christ.

### Why It Matters

The lordship of Jesus matters because it is the foundational element of Apostolic Genius—the genetic code for reproducing and sustaining genuine missional movements. When movements lose sight of this central truth, they lose their power and direction. When they recover it, they unlock transformative potential that can change individuals, communities, and societies.

This confession matters because it provides the organizing principle for all of life. Without a clear center, movements fragment and lose coherence. With Jesus as Lord, every decision, every action, every relationship finds its proper orientation. The lordship of Jesus provides missional clarity—we go where Jesus leads, we do what Jesus commands, we become what Jesus intends.

It matters because it creates the conditions for authentic discipleship. When Jesus is truly Lord, discipleship becomes a natural response to his claim on our lives. We are compelled to become like him, to follow him, to serve him. This is not about programs or techniques, but about a living relationship with the one who claims us as his own.

The lordship of Jesus matters because it provides the foundation for resistance to persecution and opposition. When Jesus is truly Lord, believers are willing to endure hardship rather than deny their essential confession. This was true of the early church facing Rome, the Chinese underground church facing communism, and it remains true for believers facing any form of opposition today.

### Biblical Foundations

The biblical foundation for "Jesus is Lord" begins with Israel's primal confession in the Shema: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one. Love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength" (Deuteronomy 6:4-5). This confession established the foundation of practical monotheism—the claim that one God rules over every aspect of life.

When Jesus affirmed the Shema as the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34), he was connecting his own mission to this foundational truth. His teaching on the kingdom of God represents another way of expressing the claim of the one God over all creation. "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33) is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema.

The New Testament confession "Jesus is Lord" (1 Corinthians 8:6, Romans 10:9, Philippians 2:11) carries the full weight of the Shema's implications. Paul's statement that "for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live" (1 Corinthians 8:6) connects the lordship of Jesus directly to the oneness of God.

The incarnation does not alter the fundamental practical monotheism of the Scriptures; rather, it restructures monotheism around Jesus Christ. He becomes the focus of our attention and the pivotal point in our relationship to God. We adhere to him—he not only initiates the new covenant; he is the New Covenant.

Scripture consistently presents the lordship of Jesus as comprehensive and exclusive. There can be no competing loyalties, no divided allegiances. Jesus claims every aspect of life—work, family, politics, economics, culture. This is the "business end" of the reign of Jesus over all life.

### Theological Framework

The lordship of Jesus fits into the broader theological framework of biblical monotheism, covenant relationship, and kingdom theology. It represents the intersection of Christology, soteriology, and missiology—who Jesus is, what he has done, and what he calls us to do.

From a Christological perspective, "Jesus is Lord" affirms both the divinity and the authority of Christ. He is not merely a teacher or example, but the one who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18). His lordship is established through his death, resurrection, and exaltation to the right hand of the Father.

From a soteriological perspective, the lordship of Jesus is inseparable from salvation. In biblical faith, salvation and lordship are inextricably linked. We cannot receive Jesus as Savior without receiving him as Lord. The redemptive work of Christ establishes his claim over our lives.

From a missiological perspective, the lordship of Jesus provides the foundation for mission. We are sent into the world as those who belong to Jesus, who represent his kingdom, who bear witness to his lordship. Mission flows from the recognition that Jesus is Lord of all, and therefore all must hear and respond to this claim.

The theological framework also includes the concept of covenant. The lordship of Jesus represents the new covenant claim of God over his people. Just as Yahweh claimed Israel through the covenant at Sinai, so Jesus claims his people through the new covenant established in his blood. This covenant relationship shapes identity, purpose, and practice.

### Historical Examples

The early church provides the primary historical example of "Jesus is Lord" in action. When Christians refused to acknowledge Caesar as lord, they were making a radical statement about the exclusive lordship of Jesus. This confession became deeply subversive, effectively undermining the rule of Caesar and all other absolute claims to political lordship. The emperors understood this all too clearly, which explains the terrible persecutions that followed.

The Chinese underground church offers a contemporary example of the power of this confession. Despite persecution, imprisonment, and the loss of external structures, they distilled their message to its essence: Jesus is Lord. This simple confession, lived out with complete faithfulness, unleashed the power of Apostolic Genius in their midst, resulting in growth from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years.

The Reformation provides another historical example. When Martin Luther declared "Here I stand, I can do no other," he was expressing the lordship of Jesus over his conscience and his life. The recovery of biblical authority and the priesthood of all believers represented a return to the foundational truth that Jesus is Lord, not the institutional church.

Throughout Christian history, movements that have recovered the simple yet profound truth that "Jesus is Lord" have unlocked transformative power. They have been willing to die for this conviction because they understood it as the heart of the Christian confession. This has been true from the early church through the ages, and it remains true today.

### Evolution of Thought

Alan's thinking on "Jesus is Lord" has remained consistent throughout his writing, though it has been developed and applied in increasingly practical ways. In *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), he established the theological and biblical foundations, connecting it to the Shema and practical monotheism. In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), he provided practical habits and practices for communities seeking to recover this truth. In *ReJesus* (2009), he explored the implications for avoiding the temptation to make Jesus "personal" rather than Lord.

The concept has been refined to emphasize its foundational nature—it is not merely one element among others, but the organizing center from which all other elements flow. The connection to existential monotheism has been strengthened, distinguishing it from philosophical monotheism and emphasizing its practical, life-shaping implications.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### Practical Monotheism (Existential Monotheism)

Practical monotheism, or what Alan calls "existential monotheism," is the belief that there is only one God who is Lord over all creation, and this lordship excludes all other claims to ultimate loyalty. This is not primarily a statement about God's eternal being in essential oneness (as it was for Hellenist theologians), but rather an existential claim that there is only one God and he is Lord of every aspect of life.

The Hebraic perspective on monotheism is concrete and practical. Polytheists can compartmentalize life and distribute it among many powers. Monotheists have only one reference point for life and existence—namely, God. The Shema is the first and original instance of this complete and systemic claim on our lives. It is a call to covenant loyalty, rather than being a statement of theological ontology.

#### The Shema and Its Implications

The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) represents Israel's basic confession: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one." This declaration, in the context of ancient polytheism, had direct and far-reaching implications. It meant that there could no longer be different gods for different spheres of life. Yahweh is the ONE God who has the right to rule over every aspect of life and the world.

This not only constitutes the basis of worship but also sets the agenda for the central religious task of discipleship. It is a call for the Israelite to live his or her life under the saving lordship of one God and not under the tyranny of many gods. The covenant between Israel and Yahweh begins with an absolute claim of Yahweh to all of Israel's life and a total ban on idols and false gods.

#### The Lordship of Jesus in the New Testament

When the early church proclaimed "Jesus is Lord," they made the same claim and with the same implications that Israel proclaimed God as Lord in the Shema. The fundamental religious situation hadn't shifted all that much. Polytheism was still the dominant religious force in the time of the early church, as it is in ours. The names of the gods had changed, but in essence the confession has the same claim and impact.

The early church rejected the claim of the overlordship of Caesar. The early Christians refused to see Jesus as merely part of Rome's pantheon of the gods. The confession "Jesus is Lord" became in their mouths a deeply subversive claim that effectively undermined the rule of Caesar and all other absolute claims to political lordship.

#### All of Life under God

The Hebraic perspective draws a direct correlation from any and every aspect of life to the eternal purposes of God. This is the intrinsic logic of the Torah. It is a natural extension of the claim of monotheism—namely, that Yahweh is Lord of all of life and not just the "religious zone."

There is no such thing as sacred and secular in the biblical worldview. It can conceive of no part of the world that does not come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. All life belongs to God, and true holiness means bringing all the spheres of our life under God. This is what constitutes biblical worship—this is what it means to love God with all of our hearts, minds, and strength.

#### The Kingdom of God as the "Business End" of Lordship

The kingdom of God can be seen as "the business, or working, end" of the claim of the One God over all of life. The New Testament writers' use of the phrase "the kingdom of God" is another way of saying that God is One, that he is King, and that he claims all and rules over all.

When Jesus says "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well" (Matthew 6:33), he is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema. The kingdom is God's claim on us—it is the "business end" of the reign of Jesus over all life.

#### Distilling the Message

Persecuted Jesus movements are driven to distill the essence of their message. When all external structures and reference points are removed, when most leaders and theologians are killed or imprisoned and all access to outside sources is cut off, they are forced through sheer circumstance to unlock something truly potent and compelling in the message they have always carried.

The result is a recovery of the power of their core message. Faith is once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus, the Author and Completer of the faith. At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple Christology (essential conceptions of who Jesus is and what he does), yet one that accurately reflects the Jesus of New Testament faith.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Chinese Underground Church

The Chinese Jesus movement provides a remarkable example of the power of "Jesus is Lord" when distilled to its essence. When all external structures and reference points were removed, when most of their leaders and theologians were killed or imprisoned and all access to outside sources was cut off, they were forced through sheer circumstance to unlock something truly potent in the message they had always carried.

The result was a Jesus movement unparalleled in history—against all possible odds they grew from around 2 million to around 120 million in seventy years. They had distilled the message to its essence: Jesus is Lord. This simple confession, lived out with complete faithfulness, unleashed the power of Apostolic Genius in their midst.

They refused to bow to the claim of the communist state over their lives, a claim that would effectively displace the supreme lordship of Christ. This clash of supreme governance is the source of spiritual conflict, and in this case, the Christians were willing to die rather than deny their essential affirmation.

#### The Early Church and Caesar

The early church's confession "Jesus is Lord" created direct conflict with the Roman Empire. In Roman theology, Caesar was a physical manifestation of a god that claimed total allegiance. Furthermore, it was the political genius of Rome to gather all the other gods of the subjugated nations and bring them under the lordship of Caesar and so create a religion that lent a deeper religious unity to the diverse political empire.

A people group could keep its tribal gods only as long as the people were willing to acknowledge that Caesar was lord over them. The fact that they were a conquered people indicated that the Roman god was supreme, so the people generally submitted—except for Jews and Christians.

The early church rejected this claim. The early Christians refused to see Jesus as merely part of Rome's pantheon of the gods. The confession "Jesus is Lord" became in their mouths a deeply subversive claim that effectively undermined the rule of Caesar and all other absolute claims to political lordship. The emperors understood this all too clearly; hence the terrible persecutions that followed.

#### Micah and His Personal Levite

The story of Micah from Judges 17 illustrates the temptation to make God "personal" rather than recognizing his comprehensive lordship. Micah sets up a private shrine in his house, where he worships idols, wears a priestly ephod of his own making, and even installs one of his sons as his household priest. When a wandering Levite arrives, Micah offers him a job as the high priest of Micah's new homegrown religion.

This attitude describes much of contemporary Christianity. Jesus doesn't lay claim to the totality of a believer's life; he just blesses their current behavior and offers protection in the life to come. This is the temptation to have "your own personal Jesus"—convenient, personalized religion that requires a minimum of fuss.

The biblical understanding of "Jesus is Lord" stands in radical contrast to this. He is not your own personal Jesus—he is the King of the universe, and he asks for your total allegiance.

### Practical Applications

#### Keeping Jesus at the Heart

In remarkable Jesus movements, followers connected their faith to Jesus with utter simplicity, removing all unnecessary clutter and embracing a simple Christology. For them, Jesus was the heart of it all, and some even died for this conviction. At its core, Christianity is a Jesus-fueled movement that seeks to consistently embody the life, spirituality, and mission of its Founder.

Practical steps include seeking a fresh perspective on Jesus, shaping life and spirituality on Jesus, shaping missional engagement on Jesus, and shaping leadership on Jesus. This means regularly evaluating all communal activities: "Would Jesus be doing this if he were here?" It means removing activities not aligned with his mission and eliminating unnecessary clutter.

#### Getting Over Dualism

Authentic faith encompasses all of life. Following Jesus excludes other loyalties and dethrones the false division between sacred and secular. This means realigning every aspect of life around Jesus—personally and communally. It means identifying and confessing idols and developing practices to break their power.

Examples include holding a monthly "buy nothing day," sharing credit card statements for accountability, abstaining from non-essentials and redirecting funds to charity, and aligning vocation and career under the lordship of Jesus. The task is to hallow the everyday—to discuss how ordinary tasks can be made holy (cleaning, shopping, working, eating, etc.).

#### Making the Gospels the Primary Text

To keep Jesus at our collective core, the Gospels must be our primary texts. While we honor all scripture, we read it through the lens of Jesus. This means focusing deeply on the central teachings of Jesus, especially the parables and the Sermon on the Mount. It means establishing communal rhythms where the Gospels are read regularly and repeatedly.

## 4. Scripture Reference Index

### Primary Scripture References

#### Deuteronomy 6:4-9 (The Shema)

**Text**: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one. Love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates."

**Context**: This is Israel's basic confession, given in the context of ancient polytheism where multiple gods ruled over different spheres of life.

**Alan's Interpretation**: The Shema represents the foundation of practical monotheism—the claim that one God rules over every aspect of life. This declaration, in the context of polytheism, meant that there could no longer be different gods for different spheres of life. Yahweh is the ONE God who has the right to rule over every aspect of life and the world.

**Theological Significance**: This establishes the biblical foundation for comprehensive lordship. It is not merely a statement about God's oneness, but a call to bring all of life under the lordship of the one God.

#### 1 Corinthians 8:6

**Text**: "For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live."

**Context**: Paul is addressing the issue of food sacrificed to idols, but he uses this opportunity to affirm the oneness of God and the lordship of Jesus.

**Alan's Interpretation**: This connects the lordship of Jesus directly to the oneness of God. Paul's statement links the Shema's confession of one God to the New Testament confession of Jesus as Lord. The lordship of Jesus is comprehensive—all things came through him and we live through him.

**Theological Significance**: This establishes the continuity between Old Testament monotheism and New Testament Christology. Jesus is Lord in the same way that Yahweh is Lord.

#### Mark 12:28-34

**Text**: "One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, 'Of all the commandments, which is the most important?' 'The most important one,' answered Jesus, 'is this: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." The second is this: "Love your neighbor as yourself." There is no commandment greater than these.'"

**Context**: Jesus is asked about the greatest commandment and responds by quoting the Shema.

**Alan's Interpretation**: When Jesus affirms the Shema as the greatest commandment, he is connecting his own mission to this foundational truth. His teaching on the kingdom of God represents another way of expressing the claim of the one God over all creation.

**Theological Significance**: This establishes Jesus's continuity with the Shema and shows that his mission is rooted in the comprehensive lordship of the one God.

**Source**: *ReJesus*, Chapter 5

#### Matthew 6:33

**Text**: "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."

**Context**: Jesus is teaching about worry and priorities, calling his followers to seek God's kingdom first.

**Alan's Interpretation**: This is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema. The kingdom is God's claim on us—it is the "business end" of the reign of Jesus over all life. Seeking the kingdom first means bringing all of life under the lordship of Jesus.

**Theological Significance**: The kingdom of God is the practical outworking of the lordship of Jesus. It represents the comprehensive claim of God over all of life.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4; *ReJesus*, Chapter 5

#### Romans 10:9

**Text**: "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

**Context**: Paul is explaining the way of salvation, connecting confession and belief.

**Alan's Interpretation**: The confession "Jesus is Lord" is essential to salvation. This is not merely intellectual assent, but a comprehensive commitment to the lordship of Jesus.

**Theological Significance**: Salvation and lordship are inextricably linked. We cannot receive Jesus as Savior without receiving him as Lord.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

#### Philippians 2:11

**Text**: "And every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

**Context**: This is part of the great Christological hymn in Philippians 2, describing Jesus's exaltation.

**Alan's Interpretation**: The universal acknowledgment of Jesus as Lord is the goal of God's redemptive work. This lordship brings glory to the Father.

**Theological Significance**: The lordship of Jesus is established through his death, resurrection, and exaltation. It is comprehensive and universal in scope.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

#### Matthew 28:18

**Text**: "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.'"

**Context**: This is part of the Great Commission, where Jesus sends his disciples into the world.

**Alan's Interpretation**: Jesus's authority is comprehensive—all authority in heaven and on earth. This establishes the foundation for mission. We are sent as those who represent the one who has all authority.

**Theological Significance**: The lordship of Jesus is not merely a theological concept, but a reality with practical implications for mission and discipleship.

## 5. Concept Relationships

### Dependencies

Jesus is Lord has no dependencies—it is the foundational element from which all other concepts flow. However, it is enriched by understanding:
- The biblical narrative of God's redemptive work
- The historical context of Israel's confession
- The New Testament development of Christology

### Contains

Jesus is Lord contains or includes:
- Practical monotheism (existential monotheism)
- The Shema and its implications
- The kingdom of God
- Comprehensive discipleship
- Covenant relationship
- The integration of all of life

### Related Concepts

**mDNA (Missional DNA)**: Jesus is Lord is the first and foundational element of the six-element genetic code. It is the organizing center from which all other elements flow.

**Disciple Making**: Flows directly from the lordship of Jesus. When Jesus is Lord, we are compelled to become like him. Discipleship is the natural response to his claim on our lives.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Rooted in the lordship of Jesus and his mission to seek and save the lost. We are sent into the world as those who belong to Jesus and represent his kingdom.

**Apostolic Environment (APEST)**: Functions under the lordship of Christ, who gives gifts to his people for the building up of the body. The fivefold ministry operates under his authority.

**Organic Systems**: When Jesus is truly Lord, simple, reproducible patterns emerge that multiply rather than expand. These systems reflect the simplicity and power of the gospel.

**Liminality-Communitas**: The intense community that forms when people share the mission of the one who is Lord. This community is forged in the crucible of shared mission.

**Metanoia**: The transformation that occurs when Jesus becomes Lord of our lives. This is the paradigm shift that reorients everything around the lordship of Christ.

### Integration Patterns

Jesus is Lord integrates with other concepts by providing the organizing center. All other mDNA elements find their proper orientation when Jesus is truly Lord. The lordship of Jesus creates the conditions for authentic discipleship, missional engagement, apostolic leadership, organic multiplication, and intense community.

The integration pattern is one of dependence and flow: Jesus is Lord → Disciple Making → Missional-Incarnational Impulse → Apostolic Environment → Organic Systems → Liminality-Communitas. Each element builds on the previous one, but all find their center in the lordship of Jesus.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan first introduced "Jesus is Lord" as the foundational element of mDNA in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006). He established it as the organizing center and gravitational force of all missional movement, connecting it to the Shema and practical monotheism. The concept was developed theologically and biblically, showing how it provides the foundation for all other elements.

### Refinements

In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), Alan provided practical habits and practices for communities seeking to recover this truth. He addressed the challenge of dualism and the sacred-secular divide, offering concrete steps for keeping Jesus at the center of community life.

In *ReJesus* (2009, with Michael Frost), Alan explored the implications for avoiding the temptation to make Jesus "personal" rather than recognizing his comprehensive lordship. He developed the concept of existential monotheism, distinguishing it from philosophical monotheism.

### Current Understanding

Alan's current understanding emphasizes that "Jesus is Lord" is not merely one element among others, but the organizing center from which all other elements flow. It is the foundational truth that shapes every aspect of missional movement. The connection to existential monotheism has been strengthened, emphasizing its practical, life-shaping implications.

The concept has been refined to show how movements that recover this simple yet profound truth unlock transformative power. It is the first step in the revival of Apostolic Genius, the recovery of the lordship of Jesus in its utter simplicity.

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "This sounds like legalism—requiring absolute obedience to Jesus."

**Alan's Response**: The lordship of Jesus is not about legalistic rule-keeping, but about a living relationship with the one who claims us as his own. It is about bringing all of life under the gracious rule of the one who has saved us. The lordship of Jesus is at once complete and graceful salvation as well as total, unqualified demand. In biblical faith, salvation and lordship are inextricably linked, but this linkage is rooted in grace, not law.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

### Objection 2: "This is too radical—it demands too much of people."

**Alan's Response**: The lordship of Jesus is indeed radical, but this is precisely its power. When movements recover this radical truth, they unlock transformative potential. The Chinese underground church grew from 2 million to 120 million because they were willing to embrace this radical confession, even in the face of persecution. The early church transformed the Roman Empire because they refused to compromise on this essential truth.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

### Objection 3: "This creates a false dichotomy between sacred and secular."

**Alan's Response**: Actually, the lordship of Jesus eliminates the false dichotomy between sacred and secular. There is no such thing as sacred and secular in the biblical worldview. It can conceive of no part of the world that does not come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. All life belongs to God, and true holiness means bringing all the spheres of our life under God. This is what constitutes biblical worship.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 2

### Objection 4: "This is too political—it will create conflict with the state."

**Alan's Response**: The lordship of Jesus does have political implications, but it is not primarily political. It is comprehensive—it includes but is not limited to politics. The early church's confession "Jesus is Lord" did create conflict with Rome, but this was because Caesar claimed to be lord. When the state makes absolute claims, it will conflict with the lordship of Jesus. But the lordship of Jesus is not about creating conflict—it is about bringing all of life, including politics, under the rule of Christ.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

### Objection 5: "This is too simple—it doesn't account for the complexity of life."

**Alan's Response**: The simplicity of "Jesus is Lord" is precisely its power. When movements distill their message to this essence, they unlock transformative potential. The Chinese underground church had to simplify because of persecution, and in doing so, they discovered the power of the simple confession. Complexity often obscures the essential truth. Simplicity allows the message to be easily transferred and deeply understood.
