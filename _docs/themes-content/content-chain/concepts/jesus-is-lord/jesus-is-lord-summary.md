## Core Definition

Jesus is Lord stands as the organizing center and gravitational force of all missional movement. This foundational confession represents the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed that shapes every aspect of existence. When movements recover this simple yet profound truth, they unlock the transformative power that lies at the heart of the Christian faith. The lordship of Jesus is not merely a theological proposition but a living reality that demands complete allegiance and brings all of life under the rule of Christ.

## Key Points

1. **The Foundational Element of mDNA**
   - Jesus is Lord is the first and foundational element of the six-element genetic code for missional movement
   - It serves as the organizing center from which all other elements flow
   - When this truth is recovered, movements unlock transformative power

2. **Practical Monotheism (Existential Monotheism)**
   - The confession represents the claim that one God rules over every aspect of life
   - This is not primarily about God's eternal being, but about God's comprehensive lordship
   - The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) establishes the foundation for this understanding

3. **Comprehensive Lordship**
   - The lordship of Jesus excludes all competing loyalties and demands complete allegiance
   - There is no distinction between sacred and secular in the biblical worldview
   - All of life belongs to God and must be brought under the lordship of Christ

4. **The Power of Simplicity**
   - When movements distill their message to "Jesus is Lord," they unlock transformative power
   - The Chinese underground church grew from 2 million to 120 million by embracing this simple confession
   - Complexity often obscures the essential truth; simplicity allows the message to be easily transferred

5. **Missional Clarity**
   - The lordship of Jesus provides clear direction for mission
   - We go where Jesus leads, we do what Jesus commands, we become what Jesus intends
   - This confession creates the conditions for authentic discipleship and missional engagement

6. **Persecution Resistance**
   - When Jesus is truly Lord, believers are willing to endure persecution rather than deny their essential confession
   - The early church faced Rome, the Chinese church faced communism, both because of this confession
   - This willingness to suffer demonstrates the reality of Jesus's lordship

7. **Integration with All of Life**
   - The lordship of Jesus provides the organizing principle for every decision, action, and relationship
   - Work, family, politics, economics, culture—all find their proper orientation under Jesus's lordship
   - This integration eliminates the false dichotomy between sacred and secular
