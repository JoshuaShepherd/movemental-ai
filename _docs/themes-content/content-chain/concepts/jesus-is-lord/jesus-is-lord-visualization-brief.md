## Concept Overview

Jesus is Lord represents the organizing center and gravitational force of all missional movement. This foundational confession is the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center that shapes every aspect of existence. Visual representations should convey the comprehensive nature of this lordship, showing how it integrates all of life and provides the foundation for all other mDNA elements.

The visual challenge is to communicate both the simplicity and the comprehensiveness of this truth. It is profoundly simple—just three words—yet it claims everything. It is the gravitational center that holds the movement together, the organizing principle that shapes all of life. Visual metaphors should capture this dual nature: simple yet comprehensive, foundational yet all-encompassing.

## Visual Metaphors

### The Gravitational Center

**Description**: Jesus is Lord as the gravitational center that holds the missional movement together, much like the sun holds the solar system together. All other elements orbit around this central reality, drawn by its gravitational pull. This metaphor emphasizes the organizing and cohesive power of the lordship of Jesus.

**Visual Elements**: 
- Central figure (Jesus/Cross/Crown) at the center
- Orbiting elements representing other mDNA components
- Lines or rays connecting the center to orbiting elements
- Movement or flow indicating the gravitational pull

**Use Cases**: Diagrams showing the relationship between Jesus is Lord and other mDNA elements, infographics explaining the structure of Apostolic Genius, presentations on the foundational nature of this confession

### The Foundation Stone

**Description**: Jesus is Lord as the foundation stone upon which everything else is built. This metaphor emphasizes the foundational nature of this confession—all other elements rest upon it, and without it, the entire structure collapses. The foundation is often unseen but essential.

**Visual Elements**:
- Large foundation stone at the base
- Building or structure built upon it
- Other mDNA elements as building blocks or levels
- Stability and strength conveyed through visual weight

**Use Cases**: Architecture diagrams, structural representations of mDNA, illustrations of the importance of foundations

### The Tree Root

**Description**: Jesus is Lord as the root system of a tree, providing nourishment and stability for everything that grows above. The roots are often hidden but essential for life. This metaphor emphasizes the life-giving and sustaining power of the lordship of Jesus.

**Visual Elements**:
- Tree with visible root system
- Roots extending deep and wide
- Trunk and branches representing growth and fruit
- Connection between roots and visible growth

**Use Cases**: Growth diagrams, organic representations of movement development, illustrations of hidden foundations

### The Compass

**Description**: Jesus is Lord as a compass that provides direction for all of life. No matter where we are or what we face, the compass always points to true north—the lordship of Jesus. This metaphor emphasizes the directional and orienting power of this confession.

**Visual Elements**:
- Compass with "Jesus is Lord" at true north
- Different life spheres (work, family, politics, etc.) as directions
- Needle always pointing to the center
- Clarity and direction conveyed through clean lines

**Use Cases**: Directional diagrams, life integration illustrations, decision-making frameworks

### The Sun and Its Light

**Description**: Jesus is Lord as the sun that illuminates everything. Just as the sun's light reveals and transforms everything it touches, the lordship of Jesus brings clarity and transformation to every aspect of life. This metaphor emphasizes the illuminating and transforming power of this confession.

**Visual Elements**:
- Sun at the center
- Rays of light extending outward
- Life spheres illuminated by the light
- Warmth and illumination conveyed through color and light

**Use Cases**: Transformation illustrations, illumination diagrams, life integration visuals

## Process Flows

### The Recovery Process

**Steps**:
1. Recognition: Acknowledge the need to recover the lordship of Jesus
2. Distillation: Remove unnecessary complexities, return to simplicity
3. Integration: Bring all of life under the lordship of Jesus
4. Transformation: Experience the transformative power of this confession

**Visual Flow**: Circular or linear process with clear steps, arrows showing progression, checkpoints or milestones

**Decision Points**: Key moments where choices must be made (e.g., removing idols, eliminating dualism)

### The Movement Formation Process

**Steps**:
1. Jesus is Lord becomes the gravitational center
2. Other mDNA elements begin to orbit around this center
3. Movement coherence emerges
4. Multiplication and expansion occur

**Visual Flow**: Organic growth diagram, showing expansion from center outward, multiplication patterns

**Decision Points**: Moments where the movement could fragment or lose coherence

## Additional Notes

The lordship of Jesus is both profoundly simple and comprehensively complex. Visual representations should capture this dual nature—simple enough to be easily understood, comprehensive enough to show the full scope of its implications. The visual should inspire awe at the comprehensiveness of this claim while remaining accessible and actionable.

Avoid visual elements that suggest compartmentalization or division. The lordship of Jesus integrates all of life, so visuals should show connection, integration, and unity. Avoid contrastive or oppositional imagery—this is about positive integration, not negative exclusion.

The visual should convey movement and life, not static doctrine. The lordship of Jesus is dynamic and transformative, so visuals should suggest growth, flow, and transformation. Use organic shapes and flowing lines rather than rigid geometric forms.
