## Introduction

mDNA (Missional DNA) is the six-element genetic code that encodes and reproduces authentic missional movements. Understanding mDNA is essential for churches and leaders who want to recover the forgotten ways of being church that made the early church and every significant Jesus movement in history so powerful and transformative.

This FAQ addresses the most common questions about mDNA. Each answer is drawn from Alan's corpus and written in his voice to ensure accuracy and authenticity. Whether you're a church planter looking to embed mDNA from the beginning, a leader in an established church seeking transformation, or someone simply trying to understand how movements work, these questions and answers will help you grasp the essential nature of mDNA and how it functions.

## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is mDNA and why is it called "DNA"?

**Answer**: mDNA stands for Missional DNA, and the metaphor of DNA is intentionally chosen because it perfectly describes how missional movements function. Just as biological DNA is found in every living cell, codes genetic information for transmission of inherited traits, is self-replicating, and carries vital information for healthy reproduction, so mDNA does the same for ecclesial systems.

The remarkable thing about biological DNA is that each cell carries the full coding of the whole organism. Even though one specific type of cell usually only refers to a small portion of the genetic code for its own structure, it has the whole deal locked away inside it. The macrocosm is contained in the microcosm—the tree is in the seed, the whole organism can be reproduced from one single starting point.

This idea of latent potentials is critically important for understanding mDNA. Because of the latency of mDNA in every authentic expression of God's people, we can say that the seed of the future is in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence. This explains why the Chinese underground church could operate consistently with the early church pattern despite having no access to external resources or teaching—the mDNA was already there, waiting to be activated.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA functions like biological DNA for the church
- Each part contains the full coding of the whole
- mDNA is latent in every authentic expression of God's people
- The metaphor helps us understand self-replication and reproduction

**Examples**:
- The Chinese underground church operating like the early church without external resources
- Each Christian carrying the full potential to start a movement
- The seed containing the full potential of the tree

### Q2: What are the six elements of mDNA?

**Answer**: The six elements of mDNA are: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Environment (APEST), Organic Systems, and Liminality-Communitas. These elements work together as an integrated system to create what we call Apostolic Genius.

Jesus is Lord is the foundational element—the central confession and organizing center that shapes everything else. When Jesus is truly Lord, all other elements flow naturally from this foundational reality. Disciple Making is the essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus. Without authentic discipleship, there can be no authentic movement.

The Missional-Incarnational Impulse combines the twin impulses of mission (sending) and incarnation (embedding) that drive the church outward and embed it deeply in culture. Apostolic Environment (APEST) refers to the fivefold ministry gifts functioning together to create balanced, whole communities capable of comprehensive mission.

Organic Systems are self-replicating, self-sustaining systems that can grow and multiply naturally without external control. Liminality-Communitas describes the power of threshold experiences and authentic community that create the conditions for transformation.

Each element is necessary, but none is sufficient on its own. The power lies in the integration of all six elements working together as a system.

**Key Points**:
- Six elements: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST, Organic Systems, Liminality-Communitas
- Each element is necessary but not sufficient alone
- They work together as an integrated system
- Jesus is Lord is the foundational element

**Examples**:
- Early church had all six elements functioning together
- Chinese underground church demonstrates all six elements
- Contemporary movements like CMA show all six elements in action

**Related Concepts**: APEST, Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Organic Systems, Liminality-Communitas

### Q3: Do we need all six elements, or can we focus on just one or two?

**Answer**: While each element of mDNA brings significant benefits when developed individually, Apostolic Genius only activates when all six elements are present and functioning together as an integrated system. This is one of the most common misunderstandings about mDNA.

Think of it this way: discipleship is a critical center of focus for any church, and any church that focuses on disciple making is going to be more authentic. Discipleship by itself will not produce movement. Other factors must come into play for movement to take place. Risk taking, incarnational mission, movement organization, and APEST ministry must enter the equation if movement is to take place. Discipleship is necessary to movement, and it requires the other elements to be sufficient.

The same is true for all the mDNA elements. APEST is necessary and will bring much-needed wholeness to ministry, but APEST alone, devoid of authentic discipleship and mission and the right kind of structure, will likely cause problems. Leaders need to develop one area, keeping in mind that it has an impact on the whole.

The power of Apostolic Genius lies in the integration of all six elements working together. When all six elements are present and functioning together, something remarkable happens: a movement is born that can transform the world.

**Key Points**:
- Each element brings benefits individually
- Apostolic Genius requires all six elements functioning together
- Elements are necessary but not sufficient alone
- The power lies in integration, not individual elements

**Examples**:
- A church with great discipleship but no mission becomes inwardly focused
- A church with mission but no discipleship lacks depth and sustainability
- A church with all elements but no organic systems struggles to multiply

### Q4: Is mDNA only for new churches, or can established churches use it?

**Answer**: mDNA is latent in all authentic expressions of God's people, including established churches. The Chinese underground church demonstrates that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can become powerful, transformative movements given the right circumstances. Established churches can become significantly missional, though transformation will take time depending on the organization's starting point.

The key is to recognize that every community that faithfully follows Jesus already has all the latent potential it needs. Our task is to awaken the collective memory and conditions for reactivating Apostolic Genius. This means going deeper than surface-level programs to the level of genetic code.

For established churches, the process involves identifying the weakest mDNA elements and making them the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element, and so on. Online assessment tools, such as the missional fitness test at theforgottenways.org, are available to help churches assess their current state.

The scope of change required is indeed paradigmatic, but it's not impossible. The challenge is to be patient, prayerful, and committed to sustaining long-term change. Don't seek quick fixes for complex issues. Most contexts will be hybrids—part organic, part institutional. The challenge is to increasingly apply the Apostolic Genius typology and all its elements.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA is latent in all authentic expressions of God's people
- Established churches can become significantly missional
- Transformation takes time depending on starting point
- Process involves identifying and strengthening weakest elements

**Examples**:
- Chinese underground church transformation from institutional to movement
- Various established churches that have transitioned to missional forms
- Hybrid models that are part organic, part institutional

**Related Concepts**: Metanoia, From Attractional to Missional

### Q5: How long does it take to embed mDNA in a church?

**Answer**: The time required to embed mDNA depends entirely on the starting point. New church planters have the advantage of embedding mDNA from the beginning, laying down the basic movemental approach from the start. For established churches, transformation will take time, and the duration depends on the organization's starting point, the depth of institutionalization, and the commitment of leadership and community.

The key is to be realistic about change. Every group must consider how long it will take to genuinely embed Apostolic Genius. Established churches can become significantly missional, but transformation requires patience, prayer, and commitment to sustaining long-term change. Don't seek quick fixes for complex issues.

The process is about awakening latent potential. This awakening happens through creating the right environment and giving meaningful vocabulary to what people are experiencing. Leaders need to create conditions where mDNA can be activated.

Remember that mDNA is something that is already there and needs to be activated. The recovery process involves stripping away the complexities that have accumulated over centuries and returning to the essential elements that have always been there.

**Key Points**:
- Time required depends on starting point
- New churches can embed from the beginning
- Established churches need more time
- Process requires patience and long-term commitment

**Examples**:
- Church planters embedding mDNA from day one
- Established churches taking years to transition
- Various timelines depending on context and commitment

### Q6: What is the difference between mDNA and Apostolic Genius?

**Answer**: mDNA refers to the six individual elements that encode missional movement: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST, Organic Systems, and Liminality-Communitas. Apostolic Genius is the emergent phenomenon that arises when all six elements of mDNA are present and functioning together as an integrated system.

Think of mDNA as the individual components and Apostolic Genius as the system that emerges from their interaction. Apostolic Genius is an emergent organization—the system that arises out of the dynamic interrelationship of all the various key elements of mDNA. This is exactly how all complex living systems emerge and evolve.

When separate, local efforts connect with each other as networks, then strengthen as communities of practice, suddenly and surprisingly a new system emerges at a greater level of scale. This system of influence possesses qualities and capacities that were unknown in the individuals. They are properties of the system, and once the system emerges, individuals possess them.

Apostolic Genius is that movemental energy, those vibrant spiritual instincts, that seem to pulsate throughout communities of faith that transform their world. It's the "spirit" that imbued the New Testament church and other expressions of the apostolic church. It's so fundamental to the life of the church that we cannot readily "see it" and name it, similar to how we struggle to define life itself or electricity.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA refers to the six individual elements
- Apostolic Genius is the emergent system from all six elements
- Apostolic Genius has properties that don't exist in individual elements
- It's the movemental energy that transforms communities

**Examples**:
- Individual mDNA elements vs. the system that emerges
- Early church demonstrating Apostolic Genius
- Chinese church showing Apostolic Genius in action

**Related Concepts**: System Thinking, Emergence

### Q7: Do we need persecution or extreme circumstances for mDNA to work?

**Answer**: While persecution can force the activation of mDNA, as seen in the early church and Chinese underground church, less intense, adaptive challenges can and do force the church to respond. The key is the presence of all six elements and an adaptive challenge that acts as catalyst.

Persecution does have a "gift" that it confers on the persecuted: it enables them to distill the essence of the message and thus access it in a new way. When all external structures and reference points are removed, when most leaders and theologians are killed or imprisoned and all access to outside sources is cut off, communities are forced through sheer circumstance to unlock something truly potent and compelling in the message they have always carried.

But we don't need persecution to activate mDNA. The Western church faces its own adaptive challenges: cultural marginalization, post-Christian context, declining influence, and the need to reach beyond m0-m1 cultural distance. These challenges, while less intense than persecution, can still force the church to adapt and innovate.

The challenge forces the church to jettison unnecessary elements and focus on what is essential. This distillation process can happen through various adaptive challenges. The key is recognizing the challenge and responding by activating mDNA.

**Key Points**:
- Persecution is not necessary for mDNA activation
- Adaptive challenges act as catalysts
- Western church faces its own adaptive challenges
- The key is responding by activating mDNA

**Examples**:
- Early church under persecution
- Chinese church under persecution
- Western church facing cultural marginalization
- Various adaptive challenges that force innovation

**Related Concepts**: Adaptive Challenges, Liminality-Communitas

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface

### Q8: How do we know if mDNA is activated in our church?

**Answer**: When all six elements of mDNA are present and functioning together, certain signs become evident. The most obvious sign is spontaneous expansion—growth happens through multiplication. New communities and expressions emerge organically.

Other signs include distributed leadership, organic growth that flows from the system itself, authentic community marked by shared mission and vulnerability, and missional effectiveness that reaches beyond cultural barriers.

The early church demonstrates these signs: they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years through multiplication, they had distributed leadership (apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers functioning throughout), they organized organically in homes and networks, they experienced intense communitas through shared persecution, and they reached across cultural barriers.

Contemporary movements like Church Multiplication Associates show similar signs: exponential multiplication, simple reproducible systems, distributed leadership, authentic community, and missional effectiveness. When you see these signs, you know mDNA is activated and Apostolic Genius is at work.

**Key Points**:
- Spontaneous expansion through multiplication
- Distributed leadership
- Organic growth
- Authentic community
- Missional effectiveness

**Examples**:
- Early church growth patterns
- CMA multiplication
- Chinese church expansion
- Various contemporary movements

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Multiplication

### Q9: Can we implement mDNA elements one at a time?

**Answer**: Yes, and this is actually the recommended approach for established churches. While all six elements are necessary for Apostolic Genius, churches don't need to implement them all at once. Start where you are. Identify the weakest element and make it the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element.

The key is to understand that while you're working on one element, you're keeping in mind that it has an impact on the whole. Each element informs and amplifies the others, so developing one area will have ripple effects throughout the system.

For instance, if you focus on developing authentic discipleship, you'll find that this impacts mission, community, and leadership. If you focus on developing missional-incarnational impulse, you'll find that this requires and strengthens discipleship, community, and systems.

The process is iterative and ongoing. You're developing a living system. The goal is progress toward having all six elements present and functioning together.

**Key Points**:
- Start with weakest element
- Work on one at a time
- Understand impact on whole system
- Process is iterative and ongoing

**Examples**:
- Churches starting with disciple making
- Churches beginning with missional impulse
- Various starting points depending on context

**Related Concepts**: Implementation, System Thinking

### Q10: What role does the Holy Spirit play in mDNA?

**Answer**: The Holy Spirit is the essential context for mDNA to function. Apostolic Genius is actually one of the essential works of the Holy Spirit in birthing, shaping, and directing the church. The Spirit provides the very ground on which apostolic movements are birthed, empowered, sustained, and effectively deliver their message.

The Spirit connects us to God and to one another, brings us to Jesus, works in and through the process of discipleship to make us more like Christ, sanctifies us, generates the mission, empowers us, goes before us, and leads the church into its own future. There is no way to God, let alone to the dynamics of missional movement, without the prior work of the Spirit in making it all possible.

Because this work is so primal, so original, so fundamental to each element and to the whole, the Spirit doesn't represent "one of" the elements of mDNA. Rather, the Holy Spirit provides the very context in which it all takes place. In fact, Apostolic Genius actually is one of the direct works of the Spirit in the church.

This means that mDNA is a work of God through the Spirit. We recover and activate what the Spirit has already placed within us. The Spirit awakens the latent potential that lies dormant in every authentic expression of God's people.

**Key Points**:
- Holy Spirit is essential context for mDNA
- Apostolic Genius is a work of the Spirit
- Spirit awakens latent potential
- No movement without the Spirit

**Examples**:
- Early church empowered by Spirit
- Chinese church sustained by Spirit
- Contemporary movements enabled by Spirit

**Related Concepts**: Holy Spirit, Apostolic Genius

### Q11: How does mDNA relate to church growth?

**Answer**: mDNA creates a fundamentally different kind of growth than traditional church growth approaches. Traditional church growth focuses on addition—attracting people to existing structures and programs. mDNA creates multiplication—new communities and expressions emerging organically through relational networks.

The early church demonstrates this: they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years, an average of 40% exponential growth per decade. This growth happened through multiplication, not addition. New communities emerged as existing ones multiplied, spreading like a virus through relational networks.

Church Multiplication Associates shows this in contemporary context: they grew to over 500 churches in a few short years by focusing on multiplication rather than addition. They embedded simple, reproducible systems that could multiply naturally without external control.

The difference is fundamental. Addition requires resources, programs, and centralized management. Multiplication happens organically through self-replicating systems. Addition grows existing structures. Multiplication creates new structures. Addition is mechanical. Multiplication is organic.

When mDNA is activated, growth happens naturally as a byproduct of the system functioning properly. The focus is not on growth but on being faithful to the six elements. Growth follows as the natural result of the system working as designed.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA creates multiplication, not addition
- Growth happens organically through self-replication
- Focus is on system, not growth
- Growth follows as natural result

**Examples**:
- Early church exponential growth
- CMA multiplication
- Chinese church expansion
- Various organic movements

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Multiplication

### Q12: What if our church doesn't have apostolic leaders?

**Answer**: Apostolic leadership is about creating an apostolic environment where all five APEST gifts can function. Every believer has some measure of these gifts. The key is recognizing, valuing, and utilizing all five gifts throughout the community.

The challenge for most churches is that they have created environments that suppress apostolic gifts while elevating others (typically teaching and shepherding). When we create environments that value and release all five gifts, apostolic influence emerges naturally.

This means organizing community around APEST functions. It means helping people identify their primary APEST gifts and creating opportunities for those gifts to be expressed. It means ensuring leadership teams include all five gifts.

The apostolic gift is foundational for releasing and nurturing the other equipping ministries. But apostolic influence doesn't require a single apostolic leader. It requires an apostolic environment where apostolic thinking, pioneering, and multiplication are valued and released throughout the community.

**Key Points**:
- Apostolic leadership is about environment, not individuals
- All believers have APEST gifts
- Create environments that release all five gifts
- Apostolic influence emerges when gifts are valued

**Examples**:
- Churches organizing around APEST
- Leadership teams including all five gifts
- Communities releasing apostolic influence

**Related Concepts**: APEST, Apostolic Environment

### Q13: How does mDNA work in small churches versus large churches?

**Answer**: mDNA is scale-invariant, meaning it works at every level from individual to movement. The fractal nature of mDNA means it repeats at every scale. Each level contains the full coding of mDNA, demonstrating the self-similar nature of the system.

A small house church of ten people can have all six elements functioning: Jesus is Lord, they're making disciples, they're living missionally, they have APEST gifts functioning, they're organized organically, and they experience communitas. A large network of thousands can have the same six elements functioning at the network level.

The key is that mDNA functions the same way regardless of size. What changes is the scale, not the elements. A small church with mDNA activated will multiply into other small churches. A large church with mDNA activated will multiply into other expressions and networks.

Size is not the issue. The issue is whether all six elements are present and functioning together. A small church with all six elements is more "movemental" than a large church with only one or two elements. The power lies in the system, not the size.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA is scale-invariant
- Works at every level from individual to movement
- Size doesn't matter; elements do
- Small churches can be more movemental than large ones

**Examples**:
- Small house churches with mDNA
- Large networks with mDNA
- Various sizes demonstrating same principles

### Q14: Can mDNA work in traditional denominational settings?

**Answer**: Yes, mDNA can work in traditional denominational settings, though it will require significant adaptation. The Chinese underground church demonstrates that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can become powerful, transformative movements given the right circumstances.

The key is recognizing that mDNA is latent in all authentic expressions of God's people, including traditional denominations. The challenge is creating space for mDNA to be activated within existing structures. This often means working at multiple levels: local church, regional, and denominational.

Some denominations are creating "missional streams" or "apostolic networks" within their larger structures. These function as movements within institutions, demonstrating mDNA principles while remaining connected to denominational resources and relationships.

The process requires patience and long-term commitment. Denominational transformation takes time, but it's possible when leaders at various levels commit to recovering mDNA. The key is starting where you are and making progress, not trying to transform everything at once.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA can work in denominational settings
- Requires adaptation and patience
- Can create movements within institutions
- Start where you are and make progress

**Examples**:
- Denominations creating missional streams
- Networks within larger structures
- Various hybrid models

**Related Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional, Metanoia

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 2; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface

### Q15: What's the difference between mDNA and other missional church models?

**Answer**: mDNA is genetic code. This is a crucial distinction. Most missional church approaches focus on methods, techniques, or programs. mDNA focuses on the underlying code that makes movements possible.

Genetic code is something that's already there and needs to be activated. mDNA is recovered from within. mDNA must be awakened in each context.

This doesn't mean methods and techniques are unimportant. But they must flow from mDNA, not replace it. When methods flow from mDNA, they're authentic and effective. When methods are implemented without mDNA, they become programs that don't produce movement.

The early church and Chinese church had no access to missional church models or techniques. They operated from latent mDNA that was activated by adaptive challenges. This is why they could function consistently despite vastly different contexts and resources.

mDNA provides the framework for evaluating and developing missional approaches. Any method or technique that aligns with mDNA elements is likely to be effective. Any that contradicts mDNA elements is likely to hinder movement.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA is code, not a model
- Code is recovered, models are implemented
- Methods must flow from mDNA
- mDNA provides framework for evaluation

**Examples**:
- Early church operating from mDNA without models
- Chinese church functioning from latent code
- Contemporary models that align with mDNA

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Implementation

### Q16: How do we assess whether our church has mDNA?

**Answer**: Several assessment tools are available to help churches evaluate their mDNA. The missional fitness test at theforgottenways.org provides an online assessment that measures the presence of Apostolic Genius in your church. The APEST test helps identify and develop Ephesians 4:11 ministry using individual or 360° feedback.

Beyond formal assessments, you can evaluate your church by asking key questions about each element: Is Jesus truly Lord in our community, or is he one priority among many? Are we making disciples, or just running programs? Do we have a missional-incarnational impulse, or are we primarily attractional? Do we have APEST culture, or are we missing key gifts? Are we organized organically, or mechanically? Do we experience communitas, or just community?

The evaluation process should involve the whole community, not just leaders. Use the Explore-Evaluate-Employ framework from the Handbook: first explore what mDNA means, then evaluate where you are, then employ practices to develop weak areas.

Remember that assessment is about progress. Identify the weakest element and make it the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element.

**Key Points**:
- Use formal assessment tools
- Ask key questions about each element
- Involve whole community in evaluation
- Focus on progress, not perfection

**Examples**:
- Online missional fitness test
- APEST assessment tools
- Community evaluation processes

**Related Concepts**: Assessment, Implementation

### Q17: What happens if one element of mDNA is missing or weak?

**Answer**: When one element of mDNA is missing or weak, the whole system is affected. This is because mDNA functions as an integrated system where each element informs and amplifies the others. Tampering with one affects the whole system.

For instance, if a church has strong discipleship but lacks missional-incarnational impulse, it will become inwardly focused and stagnant. If it has strong mission but weak discipleship, it will lack depth and sustainability. If it has all elements but weak organic systems, it will struggle to multiply.

The good news is that identifying and strengthening weak elements can have transformative effects on the whole system. When you develop one area, you'll find that it impacts others. Developing discipleship will strengthen mission. Developing mission will require and strengthen discipleship. Developing APEST will enhance all areas.

The key is to identify the weakest element and make it the focus of strategic effort. Don't try to fix everything at once. Work on one element, keeping in mind its impact on the whole. Once that element is strengthened, move to the next weakest element.

**Key Points**:
- Missing or weak elements affect whole system
- Strengthening one element impacts others
- Identify weakest element and focus there
- Work iteratively, not all at once

**Examples**:
- Churches with strong discipleship but weak mission
- Churches with mission but weak discipleship
- Various imbalances and their effects

**Related Concepts**: System Thinking, Implementation

### Q18: Can mDNA be taught, or is it something you just have?

**Answer**: mDNA is both something you have and something that can be awakened through teaching and practice. The key is understanding that mDNA is latent in every authentic expression of God's people. It's already there, but it needs to be recovered and activated.

Teaching plays a crucial role in this recovery process. Leaders need to create the right environment and give meaningful vocabulary to what people are experiencing. When people begin to understand mDNA, they often say, "I feel that I kind of 'remember' these ideas even though I have never been able to fully articulate them."

This "remembering" is the key. We're awakening something that's been forgotten. Teaching helps people recognize what they're already experiencing and gives them language to understand and develop it.

Teaching must be combined with practice for mDNA to be activated. This is why the Handbook emphasizes "acting our way into a new way of thinking." Transformation happens through active engagement.

The combination of teaching and practice creates the conditions for mDNA activation. Teaching provides understanding and vocabulary. Practice provides experience and activation. Together, they recover what has been forgotten.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA is latent but needs awakening
- Teaching provides understanding and vocabulary
- Practice provides experience and activation
- Combination of teaching and practice recovers mDNA

**Examples**:
- People "remembering" forgotten ways
- Teaching combined with practice
- Various learning processes

**Related Concepts**: Metanoia, Implementation

### Q19: How does mDNA relate to the early church's success?

**Answer**: mDNA explains how the early church achieved such remarkable growth. Despite being an illegal religion, having no church buildings, incomplete Scriptures, no formal institutions, and making it hard to join, the church grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years.

This growth can only be explained by the presence of all six elements of mDNA working together. The early church had Jesus as Lord at the center, they were making disciples, they had a strong missional-incarnational impulse, they had apostolic leadership and APEST culture, they organized organically, and they experienced intense communitas through shared persecution.

The early church demonstrates mDNA in its purest form. They had none of the things we assume are necessary for church growth—buildings, programs, professional clergy, complete Scriptures—yet they grew exponentially because mDNA was fully activated.

This is why studying the early church is so important for understanding mDNA. They show us what happens when all six elements are present and functioning together. They demonstrate the power of Apostolic Genius when it's fully activated.

**Key Points**:
- Early church demonstrates mDNA in purest form
- All six elements were present and functioning
- Growth happened despite lack of resources
- Shows power of Apostolic Genius when activated

**Examples**:
- Early church growth from 25,000 to 20 million
- All six elements evident in Acts and early church history
- Comparison with contemporary movements

**Related Concepts**: Historical Examples, Apostolic Genius

### Q20: What's the most important thing to remember about mDNA?

**Answer**: The most important thing to remember about mDNA is that it's something we recover. It's latent in every authentic expression of God's people, waiting to be activated. The seed of the future is in the womb of the present—the possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence.

This means we're recovering something ancient and fundamental. The six elements of mDNA are retrievals—they represent the forgotten ways of being church that Jesus intended for his people.

When we understand this, it changes everything. We're activating what's already there. We're awakening collective memory. We're recovering what has been forgotten.

This gives us hope. mDNA is already there, so recovery is possible. It's latent in every authentic expression of God's people, so any church can become a movement. The possibility lies at the root of our existence, so the future is open to what God can do through activated mDNA.

**Key Points**:
- mDNA is recovered, not created
- It's latent in every authentic expression
- We're awakening, not inventing
- This gives hope for recovery

**Examples**:
- Chinese church recovery
- Early church activation
- Contemporary movements awakening

**Related Concepts**: Recovery, Hope, Activation
