# mDNA (Missional DNA): Implementation Guide

**Concept**: mDNA (Missional DNA)  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for activating mDNA in churches and communities  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

---

## Overview

This implementation guide provides a practical, step-by-step approach to activating mDNA (Missional DNA) in your church or community. Whether you're a church planter starting fresh, a leader in an established church seeking transformation, or part of a denomination looking to recover movement dynamics, this guide will help you understand where you are and how to move forward.

The guide is based on Alan Hirsch's extensive research and practical experience, drawing from *The Forgotten Ways* and *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*. It recognizes that mDNA is something we recover—it's latent in every authentic expression of God's people, waiting to be activated.

The implementation process is about awakening latent potential and creating conditions where all six elements of mDNA can be present and functioning together. This is a journey that requires patience, prayer, and long-term commitment.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **Jesus is Lord**: Is Jesus truly the organizing center of our community, or is he one priority among many? Do we see all of life under his lordship, or do we compartmentalize faith?

2. **Disciple Making**: Are we making disciples who make disciples, or are we running programs? Is discipleship the norm for everyone, or an optional extra for a few?

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Do we go to people, or do we expect them to come to us? Are we embedded in our neighborhoods, or isolated from them?

4. **APEST Culture**: Do we have all five ministry gifts functioning, or are we missing key gifts (especially apostolic and prophetic)? Is leadership distributed, or centralized?

5. **Organic Systems**: Are we organized for multiplication, or for maintenance? Do we have simple, reproducible systems, or complex, resource-heavy structures?

6. **Liminality-Communitas**: Do we take risks together, or stay in comfort zones? Do we experience intense community through shared mission, or superficial community through programs?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: Missional Fitness Test (mPULSE)

- **Purpose**: Measures the presence of Apostolic Genius (mDNA) in your church
- **How to Use**: Complete online assessment at theforgottenways.org/mpulse
- **Scoring**: Provides scores for each of the six elements and overall Apostolic Genius score
- **Interpretation**: Scores help identify strongest and weakest elements for strategic focus

#### Tool 2: APEST Assessment

- **Purpose**: Identifies individual and community APEST gift distribution
- **How to Use**: Complete individual assessment and/or 360° feedback at theforgottenways.org/apest
- **Scoring**: Shows primary and secondary gifts for individuals and gift balance for community
- **Interpretation**: Helps identify missing gifts and develop balanced leadership

#### Tool 3: Community mDNA Evaluation

- **Purpose**: Group assessment of all six mDNA elements
- **How to Use**: Gather leadership team or core community, evaluate each element on scale of 1-10
- **Scoring**: Create visual chart showing strength of each element
- **Interpretation**: Identify weakest elements for strategic development

### Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Leadership team has read *The Forgotten Ways* or understands mDNA framework
- [ ] Community recognizes need for change or movement dynamics
- [ ] There is commitment to long-term transformation, not quick fixes
- [ ] Resources (time, energy, support) are available for the journey
- [ ] There is willingness to let go of programs/structures that don't serve mission
- [ ] Community is open to distributed leadership and organic organization
- [ ] There is prayerful commitment to following Jesus into mission

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Trying to Implement All Elements at Once

**Description**: Attempting to develop all six elements simultaneously, leading to overwhelm and lack of focus

**Why It Happens**: Enthusiasm to see change, misunderstanding that elements can be developed individually, pressure to see results quickly

**How to Avoid**:
- Start with weakest element and focus there
- Understand that this is a long-term journey
- Resist the urge to do everything at once
- Trust the process of iterative development

**If You're Already There**: Step back, reassess, choose one element to focus on, create realistic timeline

### Pitfall 2: Treating mDNA as a Program

**Description**: Approaching mDNA as something to implement when it should be approached as something to recover

**Why It Happens**: Institutional mindset, programmatic thinking, desire for clear steps and techniques

**How to Avoid**:
- Remember mDNA is latent, not created
- Focus on awakening, not implementing
- Emphasize recovery of forgotten ways
- Avoid programmatic language and approaches

**If You're Already There**: Shift mindset from implementation to recovery, focus on creating conditions for activation

### Pitfall 3: Neglecting Element Integration

**Description**: Developing elements individually without ensuring they work together as a system

**Why It Happens**: Checklist mentality, lack of system thinking, focus on individual elements

**How to Avoid**:
- Always consider how elements relate to each other
- Develop practices that activate multiple elements
- Regularly evaluate system integration
- Understand that power lies in integration

**If You're Already There**: Intentionally develop element relationships, create integration practices, evaluate system health

### Pitfall 4: Impatience and Short-Term Thinking

**Description**: Expecting quick results and giving up when change takes time

**Why It Happens**: Cultural pressure for quick fixes, lack of understanding about transformation timeline, unrealistic expectations

**How to Avoid**:
- Set realistic expectations (years, not months)
- Celebrate small wins along the way
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- Commit to long-term journey

**If You're Already There**: Recalibrate expectations, celebrate what has been accomplished, recommit to long-term process

### Pitfall 5: Lack of Community Engagement

**Description**: Only leaders engaging with mDNA, leaving community uninformed and unengaged

**Why It Happens**: Top-down leadership approach, assumption that leaders can do it alone, lack of communication

**How to Avoid**:
- Involve whole community in assessment and development
- Communicate clearly and regularly
- Create opportunities for community input
- Empower people to participate

**If You're Already There**: Expand engagement, improve communication, create participation opportunities

- Emerged as organic movement with distributed leadership

**Results**: 
- Church transformed from declining institution to vibrant movement
- Multiple communities planted across Melbourne
- Network (now called Red Church) continues to multiply
- Significant impact on city of Melbourne

**Lessons Learned**: 
- Movements begin at the margins
- Grace creates space for transformation
- Chaos can precede order
- Context shapes expression
- Multiplication beats addition
