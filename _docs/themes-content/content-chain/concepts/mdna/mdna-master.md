## Executive Summary

mDNA (Missional DNA) is the six-element genetic code that encodes and reproduces authentic missional movements. Just as biological DNA contains the genetic information necessary for life and reproduction, mDNA contains the essential elements that enable the church to function as a transformative Jesus movement. These six elements—Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Environment (APEST), Organic Systems, and Liminality-Communitas—work together as an integrated system to create what Alan Hirsch calls "Apostolic Genius," the life force that powered the early church and every significant Jesus movement in history.

**Key Points:**
- mDNA is latent in every authentic expression of God's people and can be recovered and reactivated
- All six elements must be present and functioning together for Apostolic Genius to activate
- Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own—they work as an integrated system
- mDNA functions like built-in instincts that guide the patterns of behavior in all movements
- The Chinese underground church and early church demonstrate mDNA in action despite vastly different contexts
- mDNA is self-replicating and contains the full coding of the whole movement in each part

**Essential Quotes:**

> "Imagine there was a power which lies hidden at the very heart of God's people. Suppose this power was built into the initiating 'stem cell' of the church by the Holy Spirit, but buried and lost through centuries of neglect and disuse. Imagine that if rediscovered, this hidden power could unleash remarkable energies that would propel Christianity well into the twenty-second century."

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

mDNA (Missional DNA) is the six-element genetic code that encodes, guides, and reproduces authentic missional movements. The metaphor of DNA is intentionally chosen because, like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every living cell of the church, codes genetic information for transmission of inherited traits, is self-replicating, carries vital information for healthy reproduction, and when mutated affects the integrity of the whole system.

The six elements of mDNA are:

1. **Jesus is Lord**: The central confession and organizing center that shapes everything else
2. **Disciple Making**: The essential task of embodying the message and mission of Jesus
3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The twin impulses of mission (sending) and incarnation (embedding) that drive the church outward
4. **Apostolic Environment (APEST)**: The fivefold ministry gifts functioning together to create balanced, whole communities
5. **Organic Systems**: Self-replicating, self-sustaining systems that can grow and multiply naturally
6. **Liminality-Communitas**: The threshold experiences and intense community that form through shared mission

These six elements work together as an integrated system to create what Alan calls "Apostolic Genius"—the emergent phenomenon, that movemental energy, those vibrant spiritual instincts that pulsate throughout communities of faith that transform their world. Apostolic Genius is the system that arises from the dynamic interrelationship of all six elements working together.

The remarkable thing about mDNA is that it is latent in every authentic expression of God's people. Just as each cell in a biological organism carries the full coding of the whole organism, each Christian and each Christian community carries the full potential of Apostolic Genius within them. This means that the seed of the future is in the womb of the present—the possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence.

### Common Misunderstandings

**Misunderstanding 1: mDNA is a program or technique**
Many people approach mDNA as if it were a program to be implemented or a technique to be mastered. This misses the fundamental nature of mDNA as genetic code—it's something that is already there and needs to be activated. mDNA is an awakening of lost imagination. We must delve deep into our collective memories as God's people and "remember" the forgotten ways of apostolic movements.

**Misunderstanding 2: Individual elements can be implemented separately**
While each element of mDNA brings benefits when developed individually, Apostolic Genius only activates when all six elements are present and functioning together. This is a common mistake—churches focus on one element (like discipleship or mission) and wonder why they don't see movement dynamics. The power lies in the integration of all elements working as a system.

**Misunderstanding 3: mDNA is only for new churches or church planters**
mDNA is latent in all authentic expressions of God's people, including established churches. The Chinese underground church demonstrates that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can become powerful, transformative movements given the right circumstances. Established churches can become significantly missional, though transformation will take time depending on the organization's starting point.

**Misunderstanding 4: mDNA requires persecution or extreme circumstances**
While persecution can force the activation of mDNA (as seen in the early church and Chinese underground church), less intense, adaptive challenges can and do force the church to respond. The key is the presence of all six elements and an adaptive challenge that acts as catalyst.

**Misunderstanding 5: mDNA is a Western innovation**
mDNA is a recovery. These elements are observable in every transformational mission movement in history: the New Testament church, the subsequent early church, the Celtic movements, the Moravian movement, early Methodism, the Chinese church, and Indian house church movements. Alan's contribution is identifying and articulating what has always been there.

### Why It Matters

mDNA matters because it explains how the early church grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years, how the Chinese underground church grew from 2 million to 80 million despite persecution, and how every significant Jesus movement in history has functioned. Without understanding mDNA, the church in the West will continue to decline, operating with institutional forms that worked in Christendom but are ineffective in post-Christian contexts.

The Western church stands at a critical moment. We can continue down the path of institutional maintenance and gradual decline, or we can choose to recover the forgotten ways that have made God's people the most powerful transformative force in history. The recovery of mDNA is not optional—it is essential for the church's survival and effectiveness in the twenty-first century.

When mDNA is activated, remarkable things happen:
- The church becomes a movement
- Growth happens through multiplication
- Leadership is distributed throughout the community
- Mission becomes the organizing center of community life
- Community becomes authentic through shared mission and vulnerability
- The gospel spreads like a virus through relational networks

### Biblical Foundations

The biblical foundation for mDNA begins with the Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20), where Jesus commands his followers to make disciples of all nations. This commission contains within it the seeds of all six elements: the lordship of Jesus ("all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"), the call to disciple making ("make disciples"), the missional impulse ("go"), and the promise of presence ("I am with you always").

Ephesians 4:11-12 provides the biblical foundation for the APEST element, describing the fivefold ministry gifts that Christ gave to the church. This passage shows that these gifts are for equipping all God's people for ministry.

The book of Acts demonstrates mDNA in action. The early church operated with all six elements: Jesus was central to their confession, they made disciples, they were sent out missionally, they had apostolic leadership, they organized organically, and they experienced intense communitas through shared persecution and mission.

The parables of Jesus, particularly the parables of the kingdom (mustard seed, yeast, seed), illustrate the organic, self-replicating nature of mDNA. These parables show how the kingdom grows naturally, spreads organically, and multiplies through simple, reproducible patterns.

### Theological Framework

mDNA fits within the broader theological framework of missio Dei (the mission of God). The mission of God is the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. The church is a sent people, participating in God's mission. mDNA encodes this missional identity into the very structure of the church.

The doctrine of the Holy Spirit is central to understanding mDNA. Apostolic Genius is one of the essential works of the Holy Spirit in birthing, shaping, and directing the church. The Spirit connects us to God and to one another, brings us to Jesus, works in and through discipleship, generates the mission, empowers us, and leads the church into its future.

The incarnation provides the theological foundation for the missional-incarnational impulse. Just as God became flesh and dwelt among us, so the church is called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach. This theological doctrine functions as a missional methodology.

The doctrine of the priesthood of all believers undergirds the distributed, organic nature of mDNA. Every believer carries the full potential of Apostolic Genius, and every believer is called to participate in God's mission. This democratizes ministry and mission, extending it to the whole people of God.

### Historical Examples

**The Early Church (AD 100-310)**
The early church demonstrates mDNA in its purest form. Despite being an illegal religion, having no church buildings, incomplete Scriptures, no formal institutions, and making it hard to join, the church grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years. This growth can only be explained by the presence of all six elements of mDNA working together.

**The Chinese Underground Church**
At the time of Mao's rise to power, the church in China numbered about two million. After decades of violent purges, with all missionaries expelled, churches nationalized, leaders killed or jailed, and all public Christian gatherings banned, Christianity was expected to be eradicated. Yet when the Bamboo Curtain was lifted, the church had grown to 60-80 million. They had no Bibles, no professional clergy, no official structure, and no mass meetings—yet they grew enormously because mDNA was activated.

**The Wesleyan Movement**
By the end of John Wesley's life, one in thirty English men and women were Methodists. In 1776, less than 2% of Americans were Methodists; by 1850, the movement claimed 34% of the population. The key was high levels of commitment to disciple making and mission. The movement declined when it moved away from its original missional ethos and degenerated into mere religious legalism maintained by institution, rule books, and highly professionalized clergy.

**The Moravian Movement**
The Moravians sent missionaries around the world while maintaining intense community life. They combined missional sending with incarnational presence, demonstrating how all six elements of mDNA work together.

**Contemporary Examples**
Church Multiplication Associates (CMA) grew to over 500 churches in a few short years by embedding mDNA from the beginning. They emphasized simple, reproducible disciple-making systems (Life Transformation Groups), organic organization, and a commitment to multiplication. Other contemporary examples include Soma Communities, NewThing Network, and various house church networks around the world.

### Evolution of Thought

Alan's thinking on mDNA developed through his experience at South Melbourne Restoration Community, where he observed movement dynamics in action. His study of the early church and Chinese underground church led him to identify the common patterns that became the six elements of mDNA.

The concept was first fully articulated in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), where Alan introduced the six elements and the concept of Apostolic Genius. The second edition (2016) refined the framework and added greater emphasis on the Holy Spirit as the context for Apostolic Genius.

*The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009) represented a shift toward practical application, providing habits and practices for each element. This showed the evolution from theory to practice, from understanding to implementation.

Over time, Alan has emphasized that mDNA is a recovery of what has always been there. The framework has remained consistent, with the emphasis shifting toward activation and recovery.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### The DNA Metaphor
The choice of DNA as a metaphor is intentional and profound. Like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every living cell of the church, codes genetic information for transmission of inherited traits, is self-replicating, carries vital information for healthy reproduction, and when mutated affects the integrity of the whole system. The macrocosm is contained in the microcosm—the tree is in the seed, the whole organism can be reproduced from one single starting point.

#### Latency and Activation
One of the most important insights about mDNA is that it is latent in every authentic expression of God's people. This means the seed of the future is in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence. This latency explains why the Chinese underground church could operate consistently with the early church pattern despite having no access to external resources or teaching.

#### System vs. Individual Elements
While each element of mDNA brings benefits when developed individually, Apostolic Genius only activates when all six elements are present and functioning together as an integrated system. This is a critical distinction—mDNA is a living system where each element informs and amplifies the others.

#### Emergence and Apostolic Genius
Apostolic Genius is an emergent phenomenon—it emerges when the system forms. When separate, local efforts connect with each other as networks, then strengthen as communities of practice, suddenly and surprisingly a new system emerges at a greater level of scale. This system possesses qualities and capacities that were unknown in the individuals. They are properties of the system, and once the system emerges, individuals possess them.

#### The Holy Spirit as Context
The Holy Spirit provides the very context in which mDNA functions. Apostolic Genius is actually one of the essential works of the Holy Spirit in birthing, shaping, and directing the church. The Spirit connects us to God and to one another, brings us to Jesus, works in and through discipleship, generates the mission, empowers us, and leads the church into its future.

#### Adaptive Challenges as Catalyst
mDNA requires an adaptive challenge to act as catalyst. This can be persecution (as in the early church and Chinese church), cultural marginalization (as in the West today), or other significant challenges that force the church to adapt and innovate. The challenge forces the church to jettison unnecessary elements and focus on what is essential.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Story of South Melbourne Restoration Community
Alan's most formative experience was his involvement in South Melbourne Restoration Community (SMRC), where he observed mDNA in action. The church had gone through the familiar pattern of birth, growth, and rapid decline. When Alan and his wife Deb were called there in 1989, they were the last-ditch effort to turn it around.

The story begins with George, a drug dealer who chose to go to jail instead of paying parking fines. While in jail, he encountered God through reading the Bible and found new life in Jesus. On release, he and his brother John began sharing their faith with everyone on their list—friends, contacts, and people they sold drugs to. Within six months, about fifty people had given their lives to the Lord, including Alan's future wife Debra.

This untamed group of people—gays, lesbians, goths, drug addicts, prostitutes, and party animals—immediately began to cluster in houses and build a common life together. What is remarkable is that here, latent in this spontaneous, chaotic, and unchurched group of people, lay the seeds of an agile, evolving, missional movement, long before they even knew such concepts existed.

The community took in just about anyone who wanted a bed. At times there were drug deals going on in the back rooms and Bible studies in the lounge. John and George were arrested a few times for disturbing the peace while trying to cast demons out of people in the backyard. Yet for all the chaos and ambiguity, there was something wonderfully apostolic about that group. The Holy Spirit was almost tangibly present at times.

Most of this group ended up joining South Melbourne Church of Christ when Alan and Deb were called there as pastors. The two narratives—the traditional declining church and the grassroots vigorous movement—came into contact, and a remarkable story of transformation began.

#### The Early Church Growth
The early church demonstrates mDNA in its purest form. In AD 100, there were as few as 25,000 Christians. By AD 310, just before Constantine, there were up to 20 million. This represents growth from 0.012% to 10% of the population in 200 years—an average of 40% exponential growth per decade.

This growth happened despite:
- Being an illegal religion, sometimes severely persecuted
- Having no church buildings as we know them—only small, converted houses
- Not having the complete Scriptures—the canon was still being assembled
- Having no formal institutions or professional leadership
- Having no programs and structures common today
- Making it hard to join—aspiring converts underwent significant initiation periods

The only explanation for this growth is the presence of all six elements of mDNA working together as an integrated system.

#### The Chinese Underground Church
At the time of Mao's rise to power, the church in China numbered about two million, modeled on Western forms. After decades of violent purges, with all missionaries expelled, churches nationalized, leaders killed or jailed, and all public Christian gatherings banned, Christianity was expected to be eradicated.

Yet when the Bamboo Curtain was lifted, missionaries discovered the church had flourished beyond imagination—estimates ranged from 60 million upwards, with David Aikman suggesting as many as 80 million in *Jesus in Beijing*.

The Chinese church had:
- No Bibles (sometimes one page per house church)
- No professional clergy
- No official structure
- No mass meetings

Yet they grew enormously. How? They intuitively knew what to do when all external support structures were destroyed. They operated in a way completely consistent with the phenomenology of the early church. This demonstrates the latency of mDNA—it was always there, waiting to be activated.

#### Church Multiplication Associates (CMA)
CMA is a contemporary example of mDNA in action. Started by Neil Cole in Long Beach, California, the movement grew to over 500 churches in a few short years and now has churches in sixteen countries around the world.

Cole explains: "Starting a single church was not an option for us; we would settle for nothing less than a church multiplication movement and we would abandon all things, even successful ones that would hold us back from that goal."

CMA demonstrates all six elements:
- Simple yet profound affirmation of the lordship of Jesus
- Emphasis on discipleship through Life Transformation Groups (LTGs)
- Masterful design of organic systems based on Scripture
- Definite missional-incarnational impulse—doing church in parking lots, cafés, pubs, houses
- Explicit commitment to APEST approach to ministry and leadership
- Mission-oriented communities that are fluid, adaptive, and adventure-based

#### The Wesleyan Movement
By the end of John Wesley's life, one in thirty English men and women were Methodists. In 1776, less than 2% of Americans were Methodists; by 1850, the movement claimed 34% of the population.

The key to Methodism's success was the high level of commitment expected of participants. This cause declined to the degree that the movement moved away from its original missional ethos of evangelism and disciple making and degenerated into mere religious legalism maintained by institution, rule books, and highly professionalized clergy.

In 1850, Methodist leaders decided that all circuit riders and local ministers had to complete four years of ordination studies. Growth ceased straightaway. Ten years later (1860) they no longer required classes and bands—discipleship had become an optional extra. Methodism has been in decline in relation to percentage of the population ever since.

This story demonstrates how mDNA can be lost when elements are removed or weakened.

### Practical Applications

**For Church Planters:**
Church planters have the advantage of embedding mDNA from the beginning. They can choose to plant movements. The key is to embed mDNA in the initiating community, especially in the understanding of leadership, before initiating the project, so that mDNA can inform the very consciousness of the church-planting team.

**For Established Churches:**
Established churches can become significantly missional, but transformation will take time depending on the organization's starting point. The key is to identify the weakest mDNA elements and make them the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element, and so on. Online assessment tools, such as the missional fitness test at theforgottenways.org, are available.

**For Denominations:**
Denominations can use mDNA as a framework for assessing and developing churches. They can focus on developing the six elements of mDNA throughout their network.

**For Small Groups:**
Small groups can use mDNA as a framework for assessing their health and mission. Each element provides a focal point for diagnosis, decision making, and development.

**For Individuals:**
Individuals can assess their own alignment with mDNA and work on developing areas of weakness. The APEST assessment can help individuals identify their primary ministry gifts.

### Common Questions Addressed

**How long does it take to embed mDNA?**
This depends on the starting point. New church planters can embed mDNA from the beginning. Established churches will need more time. The key is patience, prayer, and commitment to sustaining long-term change. Don't seek quick fixes for complex issues.

**Can we focus on just one element?**
While developing one area is beneficial, true movements require the full system. Resist the "silver bullet" temptation. All six elements are necessary for an apostolic movement.

**What if our church is too institutional?**
Every community that faithfully follows Jesus already has all the latent potential it needs. Our task is to awaken the collective memory and conditions for reactivating Apostolic Genius. Most contexts will be hybrids—part organic, part institutional. The challenge is to increasingly apply the Apostolic Genius typology and all its elements.

**How do we know if mDNA is activated?**
When all six elements are present and interacting, spontaneous expansion can occur. Signs include: multiplication, distributed leadership, organic growth, authentic community, and missional effectiveness.

**What if we don't have all the elements?**
Start where you are. Identify the weakest element and make it the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element. The key is progress, not perfection.

### Misconceptions and Corrections

**Misconception: mDNA is a program**
**Correction**: mDNA is genetic code that is already present and needs to be activated. It's about awakening lost imagination, not implementing new programs.

**Misconception: We need to create mDNA**
**Correction**: mDNA is already there—it's latent in every authentic expression of God's people. Our task is to recover and reactivate it.

**Misconception: Only new churches can have mDNA**
**Correction**: Established churches can become significantly missional. The Chinese church demonstrates that highly institutionalized forms can become powerful movements.

**Misconception: mDNA requires persecution**
**Correction**: While persecution can activate mDNA, less intense, adaptive challenges can also force the church to respond and activate mDNA.

**Misconception: We can implement elements one at a time and achieve full activation**
**Correction**: While each element brings benefits individually and can be developed one at a time, Apostolic Genius only activates when all six elements are present and functioning together as a system.

### Connections to Other Concepts

**Connection to APEST**: APEST is both a component of mDNA (the apostolic environment element) and a related framework that can be studied independently. The fivefold ministry gifts create the balanced leadership environment necessary for mDNA to function.

**Connection to Jesus is Lord**: This is the foundational element of mDNA. All other elements flow from the central confession that Jesus is Lord.

**Connection to The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement**: mDNA repeats at every scale—individual, community, movement. Each level contains the full coding of mDNA.

**Connection to Metanoia**: The transformation framework of metanoia enables individuals and communities to shift from institutional thinking to movement thinking, making mDNA activation possible.

**Connection to Organic Systems**: Organic systems are one of the six elements of mDNA, providing the structural framework for multiplication and sustainability. This concept can also be studied independently for its organizational principles.

**Connection to Disciple Making**: Disciple making is one of the six elements of mDNA, providing the depth and quality necessary for movement. This practice can also be developed independently.

**Connection to Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: This element combines the theological concepts of missio Dei and incarnation, providing the outward thrust and embedding mechanism for mission. This concept integrates two essential theological foundations.

**Connection to Liminality-Communitas**: This element explains how authentic community forms through shared mission and threshold experiences. This draws from anthropology and sociology to explain community dynamics.

#### Ephesians 4:11-12 (The Fivefold Ministry)
- **Text**: "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up."
- **Context**: Paul's teaching on the unity and diversity of the church
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This passage provides the biblical foundation for the APEST element of mDNA. These gifts are for equipping all God's people for ministry. When all five gifts function together, they create the balanced, whole community necessary for movement.
- **Theological Significance**: The fivefold ministry gifts are essential for the health and mission of the church. They represent different ways of thinking, leading, and ministering that are necessary for comprehensive mission.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 8; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 5

#### John 20:21 (The Sending)
- **Text**: "Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.'"
- **Context**: Jesus' appearance to the disciples after the resurrection
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This verse establishes the missional-incarnational impulse. We are sent (missional) in the same way the Son was sent—as embodied message (incarnational). This is the pattern for all mission.
- **Theological Significance**: The church's mission is rooted in the mission of God (missio Dei) and modeled on the incarnation of Christ.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

#### Deuteronomy 6:4-9 (The Shema)
- **Text**: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates."
- **Context**: Moses' instruction to Israel about loving God
- **Alan's Interpretation**: The Shema establishes practical monotheism—the claim that there is only one God who is Lord over every aspect of life. When the early church proclaimed "Jesus is Lord," they made the same claim with the same implications. This is the foundation for the "Jesus is Lord" element of mDNA.
- **Theological Significance**: Biblical monotheism is a claim that God is Lord over all of life. This eliminates any supposed divide between sacred and secular.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 2

#### 1 Corinthians 8:6
- **Text**: "Yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live."
- **Context**: Paul's teaching on food sacrificed to idols
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This verse connects the Shema to the lordship of Jesus. It shows that the early church understood Jesus' lordship in the same way Israel understood Yahweh's lordship—as comprehensive claim over all of life.
- **Theological Significance**: Jesus' lordship is the organizing center of the Christian faith and the foundation of mDNA.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

#### Acts 2:42-47 (The Early Church)
- **Text**: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."
- **Context**: Description of the early church after Pentecost
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This passage demonstrates all six elements of mDNA in action: Jesus is central, they are making disciples, they are living missionally, they have apostolic leadership, they are organized organically, and they experience intense communitas.
- **Theological Significance**: This is the normative pattern for the church—a movement characterized by all six elements of mDNA.

#### Matthew 13:31-32 (The Mustard Seed)
- **Text**: "He told them another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.'"
- **Context**: Jesus' parables of the kingdom
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This parable illustrates the organic, self-replicating nature of mDNA. The kingdom grows naturally, spreads organically, and multiplies through simple, reproducible patterns. This is how mDNA functions.
- **Theological Significance**: The kingdom of God operates organically, not mechanically. It grows from small beginnings through natural multiplication.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 9

#### Matthew 13:33 (The Yeast)
- **Text**: "He told them still another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.'"
- **Context**: Jesus' parables of the kingdom
- **Alan's Interpretation**: Like yeast, mDNA works from within, transforming the whole. It's activated from within. This illustrates the latency of mDNA.
- **Theological Significance**: The kingdom works from within, transforming everything it touches.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 9

#### Romans 11:33-36 (The Doxology)
- **Text**: "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! 'Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?' 'Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?' For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen."
- **Context**: Paul's doxology after exploring God's plan for Israel and the Gentiles
- **Alan's Interpretation**: This passage points to the very core of a Hebraic understanding of God: "for from him and through him and for him are all things." This is the epicenter of the biblical consciousness of God and the foundation for understanding mDNA.
- **Theological Significance**: All things come from God, through God, and for God. This comprehensive claim is the foundation of practical monotheism and the "Jesus is Lord" element of mDNA.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4

#### John 8:31-32 (True Disciples)
- **Text**: "To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, 'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'"
- **Context**: Jesus' teaching about true discipleship
- **Alan's Interpretation**: True discipleship involves holding to Jesus' teaching, which leads to freedom. This is the essence of the disciple-making element of mDNA.
- **Theological Significance**: Discipleship is essential. It's the pathway to truth and freedom.
- **Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5

## 5. Concept Relationships

### Dependencies

mDNA depends on:
- **The Holy Spirit**: Apostolic Genius is one of the essential works of the Holy Spirit. Without the Spirit, mDNA cannot be activated.
- **The Lordship of Jesus**: This is the foundational element from which all others flow. Without Jesus as Lord, the other elements lose their center.
- **Biblical Monotheism**: The Shema and the lordship of Jesus provide the theological foundation for mDNA.

### Contains

mDNA contains six elements:
1. **Jesus is Lord**: The central confession and organizing center
2. **Disciple Making**: The essential task of making disciples
3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The twin impulses of mission and incarnation
4. **Apostolic Environment (APEST)**: The fivefold ministry gifts functioning together
5. **Organic Systems**: Self-replicating, self-sustaining systems
6. **Liminality-Communitas**: Threshold experiences and intense community

Each of these elements can be studied independently, but they only create Apostolic Genius when functioning together as an integrated system.

### Related Concepts

**APEST (Fivefold Ministry)**: APEST is both a component of mDNA (the apostolic environment element) and a related framework that can be studied independently. The fivefold ministry gifts create the balanced leadership environment necessary for mDNA to function.

**Jesus is Lord**: This is the foundational element of mDNA and also stands as its own concept. The lordship of Jesus is the organizing center from which all other elements flow.

**The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement**: This concept explains how mDNA repeats at every scale—individual, community, movement. Each level contains the full coding of mDNA, demonstrating the self-similar nature of the system.

**Metanoia**: The transformation framework that enables individuals and communities to shift from institutional thinking to movement thinking, making mDNA activation possible.

**Organic Systems**: One of the six elements of mDNA, but also a concept that can be studied independently for its organizational principles.

**Disciple Making**: One of the six elements of mDNA, but also a practice that can be developed independently.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: One of the six elements of mDNA, combining the theological concepts of missio Dei and incarnation.

**Liminality-Communitas**: One of the six elements of mDNA, drawing from anthropology and sociology to explain authentic community formation.

**From Attractional to Missional**: This paradigm shift is necessary for the missional-incarnational impulse element of mDNA to function.

**Starfish vs. Spider**: This organizational metaphor illustrates the organic systems element of mDNA.

### Integration Patterns

mDNA integrates with other concepts in several ways:

**As a Framework**: mDNA provides a framework for understanding how other concepts work together. For example, APEST functions within the mDNA framework as the apostolic environment element.

**As a System**: mDNA demonstrates how individual concepts (like disciple making or organic systems) work together as an integrated system to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

**As a Diagnostic Tool**: mDNA can be used to assess the health and missional effectiveness of churches, movements, and organizations.

**As a Recovery Mechanism**: mDNA helps recover forgotten ways of being church that have been lost in institutional forms.

**As a Multiplication Engine**: When all six elements are present and functioning together, mDNA creates the conditions for exponential multiplication and sustainable growth.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan's thinking on mDNA developed through his experience at South Melbourne Restoration Community, where he observed movement dynamics in action. He noticed that this spontaneous, chaotic, and unchurched group of people had latent within them the seeds of an agile, evolving, missional movement, long before they even knew such concepts existed.

His study of the early church and Chinese underground church led him to ask: "How did they do it?" How did the early church grow from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years? How did the Chinese church grow from 2 million to 80 million despite persecution?

The answer lay in identifying the common patterns that became the six elements of mDNA. Alan discovered that these elements were present in every transformational mission movement in history: the New Testament church, the subsequent early church, the Celtic movements, the Moravian movement, early Methodism, the Chinese church, and Indian house church movements.

### Refinements

The concept was first fully articulated in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), where Alan introduced the six elements and the concept of Apostolic Genius. The original formulation emphasized the six elements as discrete components that work together.

The second edition (2016) refined the framework in several ways:
- Added greater emphasis on the Holy Spirit as the context for Apostolic Genius
- Clarified that Apostolic Genius is an emergent phenomenon, not just the sum of parts
- Emphasized the system nature of mDNA—how elements inform and amplify each other
- Added more contemporary examples and case studies

*The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009) represented a shift toward practical application, providing habits and practices for each element. This showed the evolution from theory to practice, from understanding to implementation.

### Current Understanding

Alan's current understanding emphasizes that:
- mDNA is not a technique but a recovery of what has always been there
- The framework has remained consistent, but the emphasis has shifted toward activation and recovery
- mDNA is latent in every authentic expression of God's people
- The key is not creating mDNA but awakening it
- All six elements must be present and functioning together for Apostolic Genius to activate
- The Holy Spirit is the essential context for mDNA to function
- Adaptive challenges act as catalysts for mDNA activation

The framework continues to be used as a diagnostic tool, a recovery mechanism, and a multiplication engine for churches and movements around the world.

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "This is too complex. We can't implement all six elements."

**Alan's Response**: While all six elements are necessary for Apostolic Genius, churches don't need to implement them all at once. Start where you are. Identify the weakest element and make it the focus of strategic effort. Once improved, address the next-weakest element. The key is progress, not perfection. Any church that adopts even one element (like disciple making or missional-incarnational impulse) has moved closer to being an authentic Jesus movement.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface; *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3

### Objection 2: "This only works for new churches or in persecution contexts."

**Alan's Response**: The Chinese underground church demonstrates that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can become powerful, transformative movements given the right circumstances. Established churches can become significantly missional, though transformation will take time depending on the organization's starting point. Persecution is not necessary—less intense, adaptive challenges can force the church to respond.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 2; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface

### Objection 3: "We've tried being missional and it didn't work."

**Alan's Response**: Many efforts at change fail because they only address symptoms, not the underlying system. Most change programs concentrate on structures and processes (the "petals") without changing the systems story (the "paradigm"). Unless the paradigm and the system that maintains it are changed, there can be no lasting change. mDNA requires going deeper to the level of genetic code, not just surface-level programs.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 2

### Objection 4: "This sounds like church growth techniques repackaged."

**Alan's Response**: mDNA is genetic code that is already present and needs to be activated. It's about awakening lost imagination. The difference is fundamental: mDNA is recovered from within. The early church and Chinese church had no access to techniques or programs—they operated from latent mDNA.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Introduction

### Objection 5: "Our church is too small/too large/too traditional for this."

**Alan's Response**: mDNA is scale-invariant—it works at every level from individual to movement. The fractal nature of mDNA means it repeats at every scale. Every community that faithfully follows Jesus already has all the latent potential it needs. Our task is to awaken the collective memory and conditions for reactivating Apostolic Genius.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface

### Objection 6: "This requires too much change. People will resist."

**Alan's Response**: The scope of change required is indeed paradigmatic, but it's not impossible. The Chinese church proves that highly institutionalized forms can become movements. The key is patience, prayer, and commitment to sustaining long-term change. Don't seek quick fixes for complex issues. Start with one element, build momentum, and let the system emerge naturally.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Preface; *The Forgotten Ways*, Conclusion

### Objection 7: "We don't have apostolic leaders."

**Alan's Response**: Apostolic leadership is about creating an apostolic environment where all five APEST gifts can function. Every believer has some measure of these gifts. The key is recognizing, valuing, and utilizing all five gifts throughout the community.
