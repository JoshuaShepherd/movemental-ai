## Core Definition

mDNA (Missional DNA) is the six-element genetic code that encodes and reproduces authentic missional movements. Just as biological DNA contains the genetic information necessary for life and reproduction, mDNA contains the essential elements that enable the church to function as a transformative Jesus movement. These six elements work together as an integrated system to create what Alan Hirsch calls "Apostolic Genius," the life force that powered the early church and every significant Jesus movement in history.

## Key Points

1. **mDNA is Latent in Every Authentic Expression of God's People**
   - The seed of the future is in the womb of the present—the possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence
   - Just as each cell in a biological organism carries the full coding of the whole organism, each Christian and each Christian community carries the full potential of Apostolic Genius within them
   - This explains why the Chinese underground church could operate consistently with the early church pattern despite having no access to external resources

2. **All Six Elements Must Be Present and Functioning Together**
   - The six elements are: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Environment (APEST), Organic Systems, and Liminality-Communitas
   - While each element brings benefits when developed individually, Apostolic Genius only activates when all six elements are present and functioning together as an integrated system
   - The power lies in the integration of all elements working together, not in any single element

3. **mDNA Functions Like Built-In Instincts**
   - Each element of mDNA functions like built-in instincts that guide the patterns of behavior in all movements
   - These are retrievals—they represent the forgotten ways of being church that Jesus intended for his people
   - They are observable in every transformational mission movement in history: the early church, Celtic movements, Moravian movement, Wesleyan movement, Chinese church, and Indian house church movements

4. **Apostolic Genius is an Emergent Phenomenon**
   - Apostolic Genius doesn't exist until the system emerges from the dynamic interrelationship of all six elements
   - When separate, local efforts connect with each other as networks, then strengthen as communities of practice, suddenly a new system emerges at a greater level of scale
   - This system possesses qualities and capacities that were unknown in the individuals—they are properties of the system, not the individual

5. **The Holy Spirit is the Essential Context**
   - Apostolic Genius is actually one of the essential works of the Holy Spirit in birthing, shaping, and directing the church
   - The Spirit connects us to God and to one another, brings us to Jesus, works in and through discipleship, generates the mission, empowers us, and leads the church into its future
   - There is no way to God, let alone to the dynamics of missional movement, without the prior work of the Spirit

6. **mDNA is Self-Replicating and Contains Full Coding**
   - Like biological DNA, mDNA is self-replicating and carries vital information for healthy reproduction
   - The macrocosm is contained in the microcosm—the tree is in the seed, the whole organism can be reproduced from one single starting point
   - This means that if you or I were blown like a seed into a different field, God could create a Jesus community out of each of us

7. **Adaptive Challenges Act as Catalyst**
   - mDNA requires an adaptive challenge to act as catalyst for activation
   - This can be persecution (as in the early church and Chinese church), cultural marginalization (as in the West today), or other significant challenges that force the church to adapt and innovate
   - The challenge forces the church to jettison unnecessary elements and focus on what is essential

## Essential Quotes

> "Imagine there was a power which lies hidden at the very heart of God's people. Suppose this power was built into the initiating 'stem cell' of the church by the Holy Spirit, but buried and lost through centuries of neglect and disuse. Imagine that if rediscovered, this hidden power could unleash remarkable energies that would propel Christianity well into the twenty-second century."
> — *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Introduction

> "Each element of mDNA is an irreducible and essential component of the genetic code of movement that I call Apostolic Genius. Each mDNA then is a concentrated area of focus composed of a complex of theology, practice, instincts, habits, culture, and commitments."
> — *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3

> "The possibility of movement lies at the root of the church's existence."
> — *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3

> "When all six elements are present and functioning together, something remarkable happens: a movement is born that can transform the world."
> — *The Forgotten Ways*, Conclusion

> "Apostolic Genius is actually latent in all true Christians and is, I believe, one of the works of the Holy Spirit in us. In some mysterious way, when we are incorporated into God's family, we all seem to become 'seeds' bearing the full potential of God's people within us."
