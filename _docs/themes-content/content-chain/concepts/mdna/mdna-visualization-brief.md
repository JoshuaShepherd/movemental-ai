# mDNA (Missional DNA): Visualization Brief

**Concept**: mDNA (Missional DNA)  
**Purpose**: Visual communication of the six-element genetic code for missional movements  
**Target Audience**: Designers, content creators, visual communicators  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

## Concept Overview

mDNA (Missional DNA) is the six-element genetic code that encodes and reproduces authentic missional movements. The concept uses the DNA metaphor intentionally—just as biological DNA is found in every cell, codes genetic information, and is self-replicating, so mDNA functions for the church. The six elements (Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST, Organic Systems, Liminality-Communitas) work together as an integrated system to create "Apostolic Genius"—the movemental energy that powered the early church and every significant Jesus movement.

Visual representations should emphasize: the integrated system nature (elements working together), the latent potential (already there, waiting to be activated), the self-replicating quality (like DNA), and the fractal nature (repeats at every scale). The visuals should feel organic and alive, not mechanical or programmatic.

## Visual Metaphors

### DNA Double Helix
**Description**: The classic DNA double helix structure with the six elements of mDNA represented as base pairs or segments along the helix. This directly connects to the DNA metaphor and shows how the elements are intertwined and essential to the whole structure.

**Visual Elements**: 
- Two intertwined spirals representing the integrated system
- Six distinct segments or nodes representing each mDNA element
- Connection points showing how elements relate to each other
- Potential for showing "unzipping" to represent activation or replication

**Use Cases**: Main concept diagrams, educational materials, foundational explanations

### Seed to Tree
**Description**: A seed containing the full potential of the tree, with the tree showing all six elements as branches or root systems. This illustrates the latency principle—the macrocosm contained in the microcosm.

**Visual Elements**:
- Small seed with visible "DNA" structure inside
- Tree growing from seed with six main branches or root systems
- Each branch/root labeled with an mDNA element
- Growth progression showing development over time

**Use Cases**: Teaching about latency, growth and development, potential and actualization

### Network/Web Structure
**Description**: A network or web with six central nodes (mDNA elements) connected to each other and radiating outward. This shows the organic, decentralized nature of movements and how elements amplify each other.

**Visual Elements**:
- Six central nodes representing mDNA elements
- Interconnecting lines showing relationships
- Radiating connections showing multiplication
- Organic, non-hierarchical structure

**Use Cases**: Showing system relationships, organic organization, multiplication patterns

### Living Cell
**Description**: A living cell with mDNA visible inside, showing how each "cell" (church/community) contains the full coding. Multiple cells can show replication and multiplication.

**Visual Elements**:
- Cell membrane as boundary
- Nucleus containing mDNA structure
- Visible mDNA strands within
- Multiple cells showing division and multiplication

**Use Cases**: Explaining latency, self-replication, the "each contains the whole" principle

## Diagram Concepts

### Diagram Type 1: The mDNA System Diagram

**Purpose**: Show how the six elements work together as an integrated system to create Apostolic Genius

**Structure**:
- **Center**: "Apostolic Genius" or "Holy Spirit" as the central context
- **Six Elements**: Arranged around center in circular or hexagonal pattern:
  1. Jesus is Lord (foundational, at bottom or center)
  2. Disciple Making
  3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse
  4. APEST
  5. Organic Systems
  6. Liminality-Communitas
- **Connections**: Lines or arrows showing how elements inform and amplify each other
- **Context**: Holy Spirit shown as background or surrounding element

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Circular arrangement with elements equidistant from center
- Hexagonal arrangement with one element at each point
- Layered approach with Jesus is Lord as foundation layer
- Interactive version where highlighting one element shows its connections

**Visual Style**: Organic, flowing, interconnected. Avoid rigid boxes or mechanical appearance.

### Diagram Type 2: The Activation Process

**Purpose**: Show how mDNA moves from latent to activated state

**Structure**:
- **Left Side**: Dormant/Latent state (grayed out, compressed, or "sleeping")
- **Middle**: Catalyst/Activation (adaptive challenge, Holy Spirit, intentional recovery)
- **Right Side**: Activated state (vibrant, expanding, multiplying)
- **Elements**: Same six elements shown in both states

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Horizontal flow from left to right
- Before/after comparison
- Progressive stages showing transformation
- Animated version showing activation process

**Visual Style**: Transformation theme, movement from static to dynamic, awakening imagery

### Diagram Type 3: The Fractal Nature

**Structure**:
- **Individual Level**: One person with six elements
- **Community Level**: Group of people, each with six elements, forming community
- **Movement Level**: Multiple communities, each with six elements, forming movement
- **Self-Similarity**: Same pattern visible at each scale

**Layout Suggestions**:

- Zoom-in/zoom-out view
- Side-by-side comparison of scales
- Interactive version allowing zooming between levels

**Visual Style**: Fractal patterns, self-similarity, scale invariance

### Diagram Type 4: Element Relationships

**Purpose**: Show how individual elements relate to and amplify each other

**Structure**:
- **Six Elements**: Each shown as distinct but connected
- **Relationships**: Lines or arrows showing how elements inform each other
- **Examples**: 
  - Jesus is Lord → flows to all others
  - Disciple Making ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse (mutual reinforcement)
  - APEST ↔ Organic Systems (structure and leadership)
  - Liminality-Communitas ↔ all elements (creates conditions)

**Layout Suggestions**:
- Network diagram with weighted connections
- Flow diagram showing primary relationships
- Matrix showing strength of relationships
- Interactive version showing relationships when hovering over elements

**Visual Style**: Network/graph style, showing connections and relationships

## Process Flows

### Process: mDNA Activation

**Steps**:
1. **Recognition**: Recognize mDNA is latent (already there)
2. **Assessment**: Assess current state of all six elements
3. **Prioritization**: Identify weakest element(s)
4. **Development**: Develop weakest element(s) intentionally
5. **Integration**: Ensure elements work together as system
6. **Multiplication**: Allow system to multiply naturally

**Visual Flow**: Circular or spiral flow showing iterative process. Can loop back to assessment as system develops.

**Decision Points**: 
- Which element to develop first?
- When to move to next element?
- How to measure progress?

### Process: From Institution to Movement

**Steps**:
1. **Current State**: Institutional form (mechanical, centralized)
2. **Awakening**: Recognition of latent mDNA
3. **Recovery**: Intentional recovery of forgotten ways
4. **Activation**: All six elements present and functioning
5. **Emergence**: Apostolic Genius emerges
6. **Multiplication**: Movement multiplies organically

**Visual Flow**: Transformation journey from one state to another, showing the paradigm shift required.

**Decision Points**: 
- Willingness to change?
- Commitment to long-term process?
- Resources and support available?

## Additional Notes

When creating visuals for mDNA, remember:
- **Avoid Mechanical Appearance**: mDNA is organic and alive, not a machine or program
- **Emphasize Integration**: Show how elements work together, not as separate parts
- **Show Latency**: Visualize the "already there, waiting to be activated" concept
- **Demonstrate Scale**: Show how mDNA works at individual, community, and movement levels
- **Use Movement**: Visuals should feel dynamic, not static
- **Connect to DNA**: The DNA metaphor should be clear but not overwhelming
- **Show Transformation**: From latent to activated, from institution to movement

The goal is to help people "see" mDNA—to visualize what is often intangible and help them understand how the system works. Good visuals can make complex concepts accessible and memorable.
