## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is metanoia and how is it different from repentance?

**Answer**: Metanoia is the Greek word that is often translated as "repentance," but it encompasses far more than the English word typically conveys. The Greek word *metanoia* (μετάνοια) literally means "change of mind" or "change of thinking," but in biblical usage it involves a radical reorientation of the whole person—mind, soul, and will—toward God and his purposes.

Far from the stereotypical perception of repentance as something that leaves us feeling diminished and ashamed, metanoia is a beautiful grace of God. This grace enables us to transcend the bounds of our current condition and opens us up to an expansive understanding of God, the world, our organizations, and ourselves. Properly understood, metanoia is not negative—it is not self-pity or merely remorse, but conversion—the re-centering of our whole life on the Trinity.

Repentance means looking forward with hope, not backward with regret; looking upward at God's love, not downward at our shortcomings. Metanoia is imagination invigorated, awakening to wonder. It enables us to see anew the beauty that awaits when we turn toward God's reality.

**Key Points**:
- Metanoia = change of mind/heart, radical reorientation
- More than feeling sorry for sin
- Conversion—re-centering on the Trinity
- Looking forward with hope, upward at God's love

**Examples**:
- Jesus' first words calling for metanoia (Mark 1:15)
- Paul's conversion—scales falling from his eyes (Acts 9:18)
- Personal transformation experiences

**Related Concepts**: Conversion, Transformation, The Mind of Christ

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapters 1-2

### Q2: Why did Jesus make metanoia his first public words?

**Answer**: Jesus could have begun his ministry in any number of ways, delivering what we now celebrate as the Great Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount. Instead, his first words were: "The time has come... the kingdom of God has come near. Metanoiete and believe the good news!" (Mark 1:15).

This establishes metanoia as the essential entry point to the Kingdom of God. To even hear and understand the profound truths Jesus teaches, we must first open our minds and hearts to metanoia. Encountering Jesus is an immediate invitation to fundamental transformation—to truly know God is to change.

Metanoia is the doorway to Jesus' spiritual revolution. It reveals that God is not "out there"; we are in God and God is in us. With the mind of Christ, our perception of reality is profoundly altered. The whole conception of the Kingdom is so novel that only those who are ready to make a new start can even see it, let alone enter into it.

**Key Points**:
- Metanoia is the entry point to the Kingdom
- Required to understand Jesus' teachings
- Immediate invitation to transformation
- Doorway to spiritual revolution

**Examples**:
- Mark 1:15 as Jesus' first public proclamation
- The radical nature of the Kingdom requiring new vision
- Early disciples experiencing metanoia

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, The Kingdom of God, Conversion

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 2

### Q3: Is metanoia a one-time event or an ongoing process?

**Answer**: While there may be decisive moments of metanoia, it is fundamentally an ongoing process. Sanctification is both instantaneous and ongoing; so is salvation—we are called to "work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12). Metanoia is integrated into the process of becoming more and more like Jesus, requiring continual openness to transformation.

The Western evangelical focus on one-time decisions underplays the ongoing process of conversion. As Eugene Peterson said, discipleship is "a long obedience in the same direction." Metanoia is not only entry to the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15) but also being increasingly attuned to God (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

Conversion is often a gradual process, unfolding over a lifetime—not simply a one-time event. Genuine openness to metanoia should mark the lives of those committed to loving and serving the ever-greater God. This ongoing process enables us to continue growing, learning, and aligning with the mind of Christ.

**Key Points**:
- Both instantaneous and ongoing
- Integrated into becoming like Jesus
- Long obedience in the same direction
- Continual openness to transformation

**Examples**:
- Initial conversion experiences
- Ongoing transformation throughout life
- Organizations requiring continual metanoia

**Related Concepts**: Sanctification, Disciple Making, Transformation

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 2

### Q4: How does metanoia relate to the mind of Christ?

**Answer**: Metanoia acts as a portal into an alternative universe—a gateway to the mind of God (the Logos)—leading to greater attunement to God and his purposes in the world. Through ongoing practices of metanoia, the human mind becomes increasingly configured to the mind of God in Jesus, enabling us to see the world as it truly is, through the lens of the Logos.

The Holy Spirit implants the mind of the Son of God into our hearts so that we may fashion our lives accordingly. This mind enables us to understand spiritual things, discern God's will, and operate with divine logic rather than merely human reasoning. Christo-logic—thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ—allows us to solve the world's problems from outside the closed-loop logic that created them.

Paul declares that believers have "the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16), accessed through the Holy Spirit. This mind is not automatic but requires ongoing metanoia—openness to transformation and alignment with God's ways of thinking and seeing.

**Key Points**:
- Metanoia is gateway to the mind of Christ
- Holy Spirit implants Christ's mind into our hearts
- Enables Christo-logic and spiritual insight
- Requires ongoing metanoia to access

**Examples**:
- Seeing the world through God's perspective
- Operating with divine logic
- Spiritual discernment and wisdom
- Solving problems from outside closed-loop thinking

**Related Concepts**: The Mind of Christ, Christo-Logic, The Holy Spirit

### Q5: What is wholehearted transformation and why does it matter?

**Answer**: True metanoia involves wholehearted transformation—integrating mind, soul, and will. The heart, as the executive center of life, comprises three dimensions: mind (intellect, understanding), soul (affections, passions, emotions), and will (volition, choice, action). All three must be engaged for authentic transformation.

The Great Commandment calls us to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30), engaging every dimension of our being. Omission of any component makes true love and deep metanoic transformation impossible. The heart is where decisions and choices are made for the whole person—it is the executive center where intellect, passion, and decision converge.

When at least one essential dimension of metanoic transformation is missing, confusion and inability to integrate follow. Like a body whose core functions are at odds, the half-hearted or double-minded person or organization is out of sync, working against itself and tearing itself apart.

**Key Points**:
- Engages mind, soul, and will
- Heart is executive center of life
- All three dimensions must be engaged
- Omission creates dysfunction

**Examples**:
- Churches with only mind (intellectual but unloving)
- Churches with only soul (passionate but unwise)
- Churches with only will (active but directionless)
- Wholehearted churches experiencing transformation

**Related Concepts**: The Heart, Spiritual Formation, Integration

### Q6: What is the U-shaped Metanoia Journey?

**Answer**: The Metanoia Journey follows a U-shaped curve, requiring descent (unlearning) before ascent (relearning). This pattern appears in personal development, organizational change, and biblical narratives.

The downcurve (unlearning) involves four stages:
1. **Unravel**: Becoming aware of paradigmatic issues, systemic dysfunction, and embracing the adaptive challenge
2. **Uncover**: Roaming the mind with "soft eyes"; sensing systemic flaws, movement blockers, mourning unfaithfulness
3. **Unlock**: Exploring new frontiers, imagining possibilities, fostering spiritual receptivity, moving from narrow to open thinking
4. **Understand**: Reformulating paradigms, identifying meta-ideas, seeking order within chaos

The upcurve (relearning and building) involves four stages:
1. **Paradigm**: Reformulating the mental map and DNA of the organization
2. **Platform**: Establishing soulful culture and scalable structures
3. **Practices**: Codifying rhythms and tools for reproducibility
4. **Perform**: Scaling learning, sustaining cultural health, and refining systems for future growth

**Key Points**:
- U-shaped curve: descent before ascent
- Downcurve: unlearning (Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand)
- Upcurve: relearning (Paradigm, Platform, Practices, Perform)
- Pattern appears in personal and organizational change

**Examples**:
- Personal transformation journeys
- Organizational renewal processes
- Biblical hero's journey narratives
- Jesus' own journey through incarnation, death, and resurrection

**Related Concepts**: The Hero's Journey, Organizational Change, Transformation

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapters 4-7

### Q7: Why is unlearning so important?

**Answer**: No one can learn without first unlearning. Regular repentance, or unlearning, is the price of transformation. This involves recognizing obsolete ideas, letting go of outdated practices, and opening ourselves to new possibilities. Unlearning is often twice as hard as learning, but it is essential for growth and adaptation.

As Epictetus noted, "It is impossible for a person to learn what they think they already know." The greatest obstacle to charting a faithful future is the illusion that our current understanding is the starting point for forward movement. True transformation requires paradigm change, which begins with unlearning.

The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. Learning and unlearning are continuous, iterative processes. Metanoia enables us to transcend previous understandings and break through to new ways of seeing.

**Key Points**:
- Cannot learn without first unlearning
- Unlearning is often twice as hard as learning
- Essential for growth and adaptation
- Continuous, iterative process

**Examples**:
- Churches unlearning attractional paradigms
- Leaders unlearning hierarchical models
- Individuals unlearning reductionist thinking
- Organizations unlearning obsolete practices

**Related Concepts**: Learning Organizations, Paradigm Shift, Adaptation

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 2, 5

### Q8: How does metanoia work at the organizational level?

**Answer**: Metanoia operates at both personal and collective levels. Throughout Scripture, the call to repentance is addressed primarily to corporate entities—nations and the church. Organizations, communities, and even denominations require metanoia for renewal and mission effectiveness.

At the collective level, metanoia ushers an organization into becoming what social scientists call a "learning organization"—an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. Clearly, new ideas are essential if any learning is to take place, but these can only be accessed and appropriated through the collective un/learning that takes place in a genuinely metanoic process.

The Metanoia Journey provides a practical process for organizational transformation. It requires leadership unity, apostolic imagination, telling an alternate story, and letting things die. The process involves both the downcurve (unlearning) and upcurve (relearning), creating comprehensive organizational transformation.

**Key Points**:
- Operates at personal and collective levels
- Creates learning organizations
- Requires collective un/learning
- Metanoia Journey provides practical process

**Examples**:
- Churches experiencing corporate metanoia
- Denominations undergoing renewal
- Organizations becoming learning organizations
- Movements emerging from transformation

**Related Concepts**: Learning Organizations, Organizational Change, Collective Transformation

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapters 1, 5-7

### Q9: What is Christo-logic?

**Answer**: Christo-logic is thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ. It enables us to see everything from God's perspective, think holistically rather than reductionistically, engage in self-transcending rather than closed-loop thinking, and operate with spiritual instinct rather than merely rational analysis.

Because metanoia calibrates the believer to Christ, who is the Word of God, Christo-logic is logic derived from the pattern of Jesus Christ. We can only be confident that we know the Divine Mind and operate accordingly through the prism of Jesus' life and teachings—he is "the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6).

Christo-logic allows us to solve the world's problems from outside the closed-loop logic that created them. It is holistic rather than reductionist, self-transcending rather than closed-loop, and spiritually instinctive rather than merely rational. This logic enables us to see the world as it truly is, through the lens of the Logos.

**Key Points**:
- Thinking formatted according to pattern of Christ
- Enables seeing from God's perspective
- Holistic, self-transcending, spiritually instinctive
- Solves problems from outside closed-loop logic

**Examples**:
- Seeing wealth and money through Jesus' eyes
- Understanding power and leadership from Christ's perspective
- Addressing race, gender, forgiveness through Christo-logic
- Resolving organizational problems with divine logic

**Related Concepts**: The Mind of Christ, Christology, Spiritual Wisdom

### Q10: How do mind, soul, and will work together in metanoia?

**Answer**: The heart, as the executive center of life, comprises three dimensions that must all be engaged for authentic transformation: mind (intellect, understanding), soul (affections, passions, emotions), and will (volition, choice, action). Each dimension presupposes and supports the others.

**Mind** refers to a way of thinking—a mindset rather than simply the physical brain. The mind assimilates and makes sense of experience. Because the mind is inseparable from the heart, any change of mind is a change of heart, and vice versa.

**Soul** is strongly associated with pathos: those aspects of human life that enthrall—eros, empathy, compassion, and sympathy. The soul is the seat of the restless yearnings of the human heart: passion, desire, and the search for truth, integrity, meaning, and salvation.

**Will** involves the capacity of a person to originate things and events that would not otherwise exist. This creative ability arises from human freedom and lies at the heart of all creativity.

The more we integrate mind, soul, and will, the more we experience a transformed, metanoic heart—aligned with God's purposes. Conversely, fragmentation yields dysfunction.

**Key Points**:
- Heart comprises mind, soul, and will
- All three must be engaged
- Each supports the others
- Integration creates transformation

**Examples**:
- Mind-churches lacking heart
- Soul-churches neglecting reason
- Will-churches relying on sheer effort
- Wholehearted churches experiencing transformation

**Related Concepts**: The Heart, Wholeheartedness, Integration

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 4

### Q11: What are meta-ideas and how do they relate to metanoia?

**Answer**: Meta-ideas are foundational concepts that shape all other thinking within an organization—"primordial ideas" or "cornerstone concepts." Change at this level changes everything. Identifying meta-ideas is critical for leveraging change throughout the organization.

If you are familiar with Alan's mDNA model of movement, each of the mDNA elements are, in effect, meta-ideas. These include: Jesus is Lord, Discipleship and Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Liminality-Communitas. Each of these offers powerful leverage throughout the organization.

Meta-ideas function as levers with which to move the whole system. As Archimedes said, "If I had a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, I could move the world." Meta-ideas provide that leverage, enabling comprehensive organizational transformation through metanoia.

**Key Points**:
- Foundational concepts that shape all thinking
- Change at this level changes everything
- mDNA elements are meta-ideas
- Provide leverage for comprehensive transformation

**Examples**:
- Jesus is Lord as meta-idea
- APEST as meta-idea
- Discipleship as meta-idea
- Organizations transformed through meta-ideas

**Related Concepts**: mDNA, Paradigm Shift, Organizational DNA

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 5, 9

### Q12: What is the difference between paradigm, platform, and practices?

**Answer**: The upcurve of the Metanoia Journey involves three levels that build on each other:

**Paradigm (The Seed/Mind)**: The mental map and DNA of the organization. This is the conceptual foundation, the "seed" that contains the potential for everything else. The paradigm includes meta-ideas, belief systems, and conscious competencies.

**Platform (The Tree/Soul)**: The culture and structures that guide outcomes. This is the "tree" that grows from the seed, corresponding to the soul. The platform includes organizational culture (theological distinctives, core values, vocabulary, heroes, celebrations, branding) and structures (relationships, resources, results).

**Practices (The Forest/Will)**: The rhythms and tools that make transformation tangible. This is the "forest" that emerges from many trees, corresponding to the will. Practices include core practices, habits, rhythms, algorithms, and tools.

A movement starts with a catalytic idea (paradigm), grows healthy and big (platform), and is sustained by the viability of each prior stage (practices). If any phase is insufficient, movement stalls.

**Key Points**:
- Paradigm = seed/mind (mental map and DNA)
- Platform = tree/soul (culture and structures)
- Practices = forest/will (rhythms and tools)
- Each builds on the previous

**Examples**:
- Paradigm: Missional movement as mental map
- Platform: Culture and structures supporting mission
- Practices: Rhythms and tools for everyday mission

**Related Concepts**: Organizational Transformation, Culture, Structures

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapters 6-7

### Q13: How do we identify blockers to transformation?

**Answer**: Force field analysis helps identify what enhances or hinders organizational objectives. Boosters are forces that support change; blockers are forces that resist it. Metanoia comes into play by exposing what limits the achievement of vision and enabling transformation.

Common blockers include: attractional forms that undermine missional intent, obsolete paradigms that no longer fit new contexts, reductionist thinking that fragments understanding, institutional inertia that resists change, and traditionalism that outsources thinking.

The "Uncover" stage of the Metanoia Journey involves sensing systemic flaws, movement blockers, and mourning unfaithfulness. Key questions include: What cultural upheavals or anomalies have surfaced? How do these inconsistencies make us feel? Where have we recognized our unfaithfulness to God's mission? What are the cornerstone concepts on which our organization is built? Can we identify three to five blockers that hinder our purpose?

**Key Points**:
- Force field analysis identifies boosters and blockers
- Common blockers: attractional forms, obsolete paradigms, reductionist thinking
- Uncover stage involves sensing systemic flaws
- Key questions help identify blockers

**Examples**:
- Attractional structures blocking missional intent
- Hierarchical models blocking distributed leadership
- Programmatic thinking blocking organic systems
- Institutional inertia blocking innovation

**Related Concepts**: Force Field Analysis, Organizational Assessment, Barriers to Change

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 5

### Q14: What is the role of childlikeness in metanoia?

**Answer**: Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3). Childlikeness—humility, playfulness, openness to wonder, and an accepting spirit—enables ongoing un/learning. Recovering this approach ("beginner's mind") is the path to spiritual wisdom and creative breakthroughs.

Children do not act as if their mental map is complete and reliable; they are open to outside guidance. Adults often live as if their mental map is the final word, making it impossible for them to live with the playfulness of children. Metanoia requires childlike openness—the willingness to see things as if for the first time, to wonder, to explore, and to learn.

Einstein retained a childlike curiosity, claiming, "I have no special gifts. I am only passionately curious." Michael Polanyi observed that metanoia is an intensified adult form of the worldview development found in children. Recovering this approach is essential for ongoing transformation.

**Key Points**:
- Childlikeness enables ongoing un/learning
- Openness to wonder and exploration
- Beginner's mind approach
- Path to spiritual wisdom and breakthroughs

**Examples**:
- Children's natural curiosity and wonder
- Adults stuck in fixed mental maps
- Leaders recovering childlike openness
- Organizations fostering learning culture

**Related Concepts**: Learning, Wonder, Openness, Beginner's Mind

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 2, 7

### Q15: How does metanoia relate to seeing reality as it is?

**Answer**: Max De Pree asserted, "The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality." While Jesus decisively shapes the movement bearing his name, leaders must take seriously the task of delineating the framework within which people think about his church. Allowing Jesus to guide, leaders must manage how the organization sees itself and its function in the world.

Metanoia enables us to see reality for what it is, rather than through clouded lenses. Common clouded lenses include: rose-colored glasses (seeing only what we wish to see), confirmation bias (interpreting reality to affirm existing beliefs), and all answers/no questions (expecting leaders to have all answers).

Abraham Heschel contends that prior knowledge can prevent us from truly seeing reality. He writes, "The principle to be kept in mind is to know what we see rather than to see what we know." He further teaches the importance of perceiving and thinking in the present—an ability that is foundational to true insight: metanoia.

**Key Points**:
- Leaders must define reality
- Metanoia enables seeing reality as it is
- Common clouded lenses distort perception
- Know what we see, not see what we know

**Examples**:
- Leaders seeing only what they wish to see
- Confirmation bias in organizational assessment
- Organizations with clouded lenses
- Metanoia enabling clear vision

**Related Concepts**: Leadership, Perception, Reality, Insight

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 6

### Q16: What is the relationship between core values and core practices?

**Answer**: Core values are often displayed on walls, in literature, on websites, and more. The problem arises in actually living them out. One reason for this is that we have mainly informed people's heads and not required anything of their behavior. In communities shaped by values, it's hard to disagree with them—each value often has a Bible verse attached, and who can argue with Scripture? But because value statements appeal primarily to beliefs and don't require much else, the common response is mere assent.

Instead of merely writing, talking, teaching, and lecturing about culture and values, we suggest you develop common practices that give people pathways to act their way into a new way of thinking. Core practices are specific expressions of our core DNA, which are fractalized throughout the organization. They embody the values of the organization and are lived out through the lives of its members and their wider community.

The progression follows: Core Values → Core Practices → Habits → Rhythms → Algorithms. This progression engages the will of the organization, making transformation tangible and embodied.

**Key Points**:
- Core values often remain unembodied
- Core practices give pathways to act
- Practices embody values and DNA
- Progression: Values → Practices → Habits → Rhythms → Algorithms

**Examples**:
- Churches with values but no practices
- Organizations developing core practices
- Practices embodying organizational DNA
- Transformation through embodied practices

**Related Concepts**: Core Values, Practices, Habits, Organizational Culture

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 7

### Q17: How does metanoia create learning organizations?

**Answer**: At the collective level, metanoia ushers an organization into becoming what social scientists call a "learning organization"—an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. Clearly, new ideas are essential if any learning is to take place, but these can only be accessed and appropriated through the collective un/learning that takes place in a genuinely metanoic process.

Learning organizations are dynamic, adaptive, and innovative by nature. They program ongoing change—metanoia—into their definitions, recognizing that all living systems must expel waste (obsolete practices) to stay healthy. Metanoia is essential for this kind of renewal.

Organizations committed to metanoia become true learning organizations—skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. This enables them to adapt to changing contexts and remain effective in mission.

**Key Points**:
- Metanoia creates learning organizations
- Skilled at creating, acquiring, transferring knowledge
- Dynamic, adaptive, innovative by nature
- Program ongoing change into definitions

**Examples**:
- Organizations that learn and adapt
- Churches becoming learning communities
- Movements that innovate and grow
- Systems that evolve and improve

**Related Concepts**: Learning Organizations, Adaptation, Innovation, Organizational Development

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 1, 7

### Q18: What is the role of lament in metanoia?

**Answer**: We must also feel the pain of our own intransigence—the tension between our as-is state and the calling Jesus originally designed for us. Metanoia engages mind, soul, and will—an experience often marked by lament, referred to by Christian mystics as the "gift of tears." Such tears engage both sides of the brain, uniting mind, soul, and will.

Do not fear lament or weeping—corporate lament can act as a catalyst for communities seeking breakthrough. Almost every revival is marked by both weeping and rejoicing. The "Uncover" stage of the Metanoia Journey involves mourning unfaithfulness, recognizing where we have failed to be faithful to God's mission and purpose.

Lament is not self-pity but honest recognition of the gap between who we are and who God calls us to be. This recognition creates the conditions for transformation, opening us to God's grace and new possibilities.

**Key Points**:
- Lament marks metanoic experience
- Gift of tears unites mind, soul, and will
- Corporate lament can catalyze breakthrough
- Honest recognition of gap creates conditions for transformation

**Examples**:
- Personal moments of deep transformation with tears
- Corporate lament in revivals
- Organizations mourning unfaithfulness
- Breakthrough following lament

**Related Concepts**: Lament, Mourning, Transformation, Revival

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 5

---

### Q19: How does metanoia relate to the form of Christ?

**Answer**: The "form of Christ" involves the overall pattern or gestalt—the complete, integrated figure through which the parts become intelligible. This Christoformity is both divine and human, archetypal and personal, the standard by which the church and individual believers find their true identity and vocation.

Bonhoeffer aptly names the church as "the form of Christ in the world": "The Church is nothing but a section of humanity in which Christ has truly taken form." Through metanoia, we are redefined by Jesus and find our true measure in him. The form of Christ is critical for recognizing the authenticity of the church and for assessing the world's condition from a Christ-centered perspective.

Metanoia enables us to sense the invisible—the form of Christ that should shape all we are and do. This form provides the pattern for authentic church life and mission, enabling us to see and embody Christ in the world.

**Key Points**:
- Form of Christ = overall pattern/gestalt
- Church is form of Christ in the world
- Metanoia redefines us by Jesus
- Provides pattern for authentic church life

**Examples**:
- Churches conforming to form of Christ
- Organizations embodying Christ's pattern
- Individual believers taking Christ's form
- Mission shaped by Christ's form

**Related Concepts**: Christology, The Form of Christ, Christoformity, Ecclesiology

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 8

### Q20: How do we implement metanoia in our organization?

**Answer**: Implementing metanoia involves the Metanoia Journey process, which follows a U-shaped curve. The downcurve (unlearning) involves: Unravel (becoming aware of paradigmatic issues), Uncover (sensing systemic flaws), Unlock (exploring new frontiers), and Understand (reformulating paradigms). The upcurve (relearning) involves: Paradigm (reformulating mental map and DNA), Platform (establishing culture and structures), Practices (codifying rhythms and tools), and Perform (scaling and sustaining).

The process requires: leadership unity (staff and board working together), apostolic imagination (right-brained creativity and innovation), telling an alternate story (centered on Jesus and his kingdom), and letting things die (relinquishing old systems).

Key steps include: completing force field analysis to identify blockers, engaging in the downcurve process of unlearning, reformulating paradigm and DNA, shaping culture and structures, developing core practices, and creating rhythms and tools for ongoing transformation.

**Key Points**:
- Metanoia Journey provides practical process
- U-shaped curve: unlearning before relearning
- Requires leadership unity, apostolic imagination, alternate story
- Involves paradigm, platform, and practices

**Examples**:
- Organizations using Metanoia Journey
- Churches experiencing transformation
- Movements emerging from metanoia
- Leaders implementing process

**Related Concepts**: The Metanoia Journey, Organizational Transformation, Implementation

**Sources**: *Metanoia*, Chapters 5-7
