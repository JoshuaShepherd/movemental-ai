## Introduction

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. This mDNA element links two discrete theological motivators that combine to extend the impact of the gospel and embed the Jesus story deeply into the host culture. Yet it is one of the most easily overlooked elements because it is obscured by the evangelistic-attractional impulse that dominates much of contemporary church practice.

This FAQ addresses the most common questions about what the missional-incarnational impulse means, how it differs from attractional approaches, why it matters for missional movement, and how to implement it in contemporary contexts. Each answer is drawn from Alan's corpus and written in his voice to ensure accuracy and authenticity.

## Questions

### Q1: What is the difference between missional and attractional approaches?

**Answer**: The missional approach is centrifugal (go-to-them) rather than centripetal (come-to-us). It is a sending rather than an attractional approach. The New Testament pattern of mission is centrifugal—we go to them, we do not ask them to come to us. When Jesus likens the kingdom of God to seeds being sown, he is not kidding. The missional impulse creates a viral "sneeze-like" pattern of outward movement.

The attractional approach, by contrast, relies on come-and-get-it methods. It asks people to come to us, to adapt to our culture, to fit into our programs. The strategy is to stimulate numerical growth through better programming, improved plant and resources, and effective marketing. In our standard forms, there is no real emphasis on going but a whole lot of coming.

The net effect of using attractional evangelism only is to unwittingly block the outward-bound movement that is built into the message of the gospel itself. Instead of being sown in the wind, the seeds are put into ecclesial storehouses, thus effectively extinguishing the purpose for which seeds were made.

**Key Points**:
- Missional is go-to-them (centrifugal); attractional is come-to-us (centripetal)
- The New Testament pattern is missional, not attractional
- Attractional approaches block the outward-bound movement built into the gospel
- Seeds must be sown, not stored

**Examples**:
- The early church went to the ends of the earth (missional)
- Contemporary attractional churches ask people to come to services (attractional)

### Q2: How do we shift from come-to-us to go-to-them?

**Answer**: Shifting from come-to-us to go-to-them requires a fundamental reorientation of our approach to mission. It begins with recognizing that we are a sent people, not a gathering people. We are sent into the world, not called to gather the world to us. This shift affects everything—our time, our resources, our priorities, our practices.

Practical steps include: going out (moving God's people into the hub of life through proximity, frequency, and spontaneity), going deep (embedding the gospel within the fabric of community through meaningful relationships and engagement), minimizing "in-house" meetings, and investing time in community presence.

The shift also requires changing our metrics. Instead of measuring how many people come to us, we measure how many people we are going to. Instead of measuring attendance, we measure engagement. Instead of measuring programs, we measure presence.

**Key Points**:
- Recognize we are a sent people, not a gathering people
- Go out (proximity, frequency, spontaneity) and go deep (meaningful engagement)
- Minimize in-house meetings; invest in community presence
- Change metrics from attendance to engagement

**Examples**:
- Move into neighborhoods where mission is focused
- Spend time in local gathering places regularly
- Share meals with both group and non-group members

### Q3: What does it mean to live incarnationally?

**Answer**: Living incarnationally means becoming flesh and dwelling among those we are seeking to reach, just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us. It is not just about cultural relevance or contextualization, but about presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership.

Presence means being physically present in the communities we are seeking to reach—living among them, not just visiting them. Participation means engaging with the life of the community, not just observing it from the outside. This means engaging with their culture, their struggles, their joys, and their concerns.

Proclamation means that our presence and participation create opportunities for proclamation. The gospel is communicated not just through words, but through the way we live our lives. Partnership means working alongside the community, not above it. We see ourselves as partners in God's mission, not as saviors bringing solutions from the outside.

**Key Points**:
- Incarnation means becoming flesh and dwelling among them
- Requires presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership
- Not just cultural relevance, but deep engagement
- Working alongside, not above, the community

**Examples**:
- Moving into neighborhoods where mission is focused
- Participating in community life, not just observing
- Sharing the gospel through relationship and life

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6; *The Shaping of Things to Come*

### Q4: How do presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation work together?

**Answer**: Presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation (the EPIC framework developed by Michael Frost) work together to create authentic incarnational engagement. Presence means that God, in Jesus, moved into the neighborhood. Relationships and close connection are essential. We must be physically present in the communities we are seeking to reach.

Proximity means that Jesus engaged people from all walks of life; so must we. This involves moving into neighborhoods where mission is focused, spending time in local gathering places, and building familiarity through regular presence. Proximity creates the conditions for relationship and understanding.

Powerlessness means serving with humility and rejecting power-based leadership. We do not come as those who have all the answers or who are superior, but as those who serve. This vulnerability creates trust and opens doors for authentic engagement.

Proclamation means being prepared to share the gospel wherever we go. Our presence, proximity, and powerlessness create opportunities for proclamation. The gospel is communicated not just through words, but through the way we live our lives.

**Key Points**:
- Presence: Moving into the neighborhood, being physically present
- Proximity: Engaging people from all walks of life, building familiarity
- Powerlessness: Serving with humility, rejecting power-based leadership
- Proclamation: Sharing the gospel through words and life

**Examples**:
- Moving into inner-city neighborhoods (presence and proximity)
- Serving with humility (powerlessness)
- Sharing the gospel relationally (proclamation)

### Q5: What is the relationship between mission and incarnation?

**Answer**: Mission and incarnation are not two separate things, but one integrated reality. Mission without incarnation becomes colonial and exploitative. Incarnation without mission becomes accommodation and compromise. Together, they create a powerful force for transformation.

The missional impulse is the outward thrust that compels us to go. The incarnational impulse is the way in which we go—as embodied message, becoming flesh and dwelling among them. We are sent (missional), but we are also told how we are to be sent (incarnationally)—in the same way in which the Son was sent.

The integration means that we go to them (missional) and we become part of them (incarnational). We do not remain separate or distant, but we enter into the very fabric of their existence. This is how God chose to redeem the world—not from a distance, but by entering into it.

**Key Points**:
- Mission and incarnation are one integrated reality
- Mission without incarnation becomes colonial; incarnation without mission becomes accommodation
- We are sent (missional) and we are sent incarnationally (as embodied message)
- We go to them and become part of them

**Examples**:
- The early church went to the ends of the earth and became part of communities
- Celtic missionaries lived among the people, learning language and culture

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Q6: How do we avoid colonial or exploitative approaches?

**Answer**: Avoiding colonial or exploitative approaches requires maintaining the integration of mission and incarnation. When mission is separated from incarnation, it becomes colonial—we go to them but remain separate, bringing our solutions from the outside. When we live incarnationally, we become part of the community, working alongside them as partners.

Key principles include: working alongside the community, not above it; seeing ourselves as partners in God's mission, not as saviors; listening deeply to the community's story, needs, and rhythms; redeeming and affirming what is good while gently challenging what is not; and maintaining gospel integrity while adapting our methods.

The goal is not to impose our culture or solutions, but to embody the gospel authentically in the host culture. This requires humility, patience, and a willingness to learn from the community we are seeking to serve.

**Key Points**:
- Maintain integration of mission and incarnation
- Work alongside, not above, the community
- See ourselves as partners, not saviors
- Listen deeply and adapt authentically

**Examples**:
- Learning local language and customs
- Participating in community life
- Working alongside community members

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Jesus is Lord

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6; *The Shaping of Things to Come*

### Q7: How do we maintain gospel integrity while contextualizing?

**Answer**: Maintaining gospel integrity while contextualizing requires understanding the difference between the gospel (which is unchanging) and our methods (which must adapt to context). The gospel is the message of God's redemption through Jesus Christ. This message does not change, but how we communicate and embody it must adapt to each cultural context.

Contextualization means making the gospel accessible and understandable in each cultural context without compromising its essential truth. It requires understanding the culture, learning the language, engaging with the worldview, and finding ways to communicate the gospel that resonate with that culture.

The key is to maintain the essential truth of the gospel while adapting our methods. We do not change the message, but we change how we communicate and embody it. This requires deep cultural understanding, theological clarity, and authentic relationship.

**Key Points**:
- The gospel is unchanging; methods must adapt
- Contextualization makes the gospel accessible without compromising truth
- Requires understanding culture, learning language, engaging worldview
- Maintain essential truth while adapting communication

**Examples**:
- Learning local language and customs
- Finding cultural forms that communicate the gospel
- Maintaining theological clarity while adapting methods

### Q8: What does "going out" mean in practice?

**Answer**: "Going out" means moving God's people into the hub of life, fostering mission through proximity, frequency, and spontaneity. Proximity involves moving into neighborhoods where mission is focused and spending time in local gathering places (cafés, sports clubs, pubs, parks)—these natural habitats foster relationships.

Frequency means regularly visiting the same places to build familiarity. Shop at the same local stores. Attend school pickup or community events regularly. Share meals or social time with both group and non-group members. Regular presence builds trust and creates opportunities for relationship.

Spontaneity means making space for impromptu connection. Reorder schedules collectively and individually to allow for spontaneity. Minimize "in-house" meetings; invest time in community presence. Organize gatherings with flexibility, responding to opportunities as they arise.

**Key Points**:
- Going out means moving into the hub of life
- Proximity: Move into neighborhoods, spend time in gathering places
- Frequency: Regularly visit same places to build familiarity
- Spontaneity: Make space for impromptu connection

**Examples**:
- Moving into inner-city neighborhoods
- Regular presence at local cafés or parks
- Flexible schedules that allow for spontaneous engagement

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Organic Systems

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 4

### Q9: What does "going deep" mean in practice?

**Answer**: "Going deep" means embedding the gospel within the fabric of community through meaningful relationships and engagement. This involves meaningful engagement (investing time in genuine friendships, participating in rites of passage like weddings and funerals, learning the art of meaningful conversation), proclamation (sharing the gospel relationally and conversationally, exciting curiosity through stories), holy living (living lives that embody the message, celebrating life and practicing hospitality), hospitality (regularly sharing meals, especially with the marginalized, hosting celebrations), contextualizing community (encouraging new Christian communities to form their own expressions, listening deeply to the community's story), and sending (continuing to send out teams to seed and embed the gospel).

Going deep is about quality of relationship and engagement, not just quantity of contacts. It takes time, patience, and commitment. It cannot be rushed or forced.

**Key Points**:
- Going deep means embedding the gospel within the fabric of community
- Requires meaningful engagement, proclamation, holy living, hospitality
- About quality of relationship, not just quantity
- Takes time, patience, and commitment

**Examples**:
- Investing in genuine friendships
- Participating in community rites of passage
- Sharing meals regularly with neighbors

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Liminality-Communitas

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 4

### Q10: Why is the attractional model limited?

**Answer**: The attractional model is limited because it is effective only in m0–m1 contexts—where there is little cultural distance between the church and the culture. As cultural complexity increases, the attractional model becomes less and less effective. It is good at harvesting the low-hanging cultural fruit but has no real vision, understanding, and method of how to reach beyond a merely evangelistic approach to context.

The attractional model relies on come-and-get-it approaches that work when people are already culturally close to the church. But when cultural distance increases, these approaches fail. The strategy becomes to stimulate numerical growth through better programming, improved plant and resources, and effective marketing—but this cannot reach beyond cultural barriers.

The missional-incarnational model, by contrast, can reach where the attractional model cannot. It goes to them rather than asking them to come to us. It embeds the gospel in the host culture rather than expecting the culture to adapt to the church.

**Key Points**:
- Attractional model effective only in m0–m1 contexts
- Cannot reach beyond cultural barriers
- Good at harvesting low-hanging fruit but not deep engagement
- Missional-incarnational model can reach where attractional cannot

**Examples**:
- Attractional works when people are culturally close
- Missional-incarnational works across cultural distance
- Early church went to diverse cultures (missional-incarnational)

**Related Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional, Disciple Making

### Q11: How does the missional-incarnational impulse relate to the missio Dei?

**Answer**: The missional-incarnational impulse is the practical outworking of the missio Dei (the mission of God). Mission is not merely an activity of the church, but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. Mission means "sending," and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God's action in human history.

God is a "missionary God," and the church is a "sent people." As God sent the Son into the world, so we are at core a sent or simply a missionary people. The missional-incarnational impulse is how we participate in God's mission—by going (missional) and by becoming part of the communities we reach (incarnational).

This connects our mission to God's mission. We are not creating our own mission, but participating in the mission that God has been about from the beginning. The missional-incarnational impulse is how we join God in his mission to restore and heal creation.

**Key Points**:
- The missional-incarnational impulse is the practical outworking of the missio Dei
- Mission is God's initiative, not just the church's activity
- God is a "missionary God," and we are a "sent people"
- We participate in God's mission by going and becoming part of communities

**Examples**:
- God's mission began with Israel being a blessing to the nations
- Jesus's mission was to seek and save the lost
- Our mission is to participate in God's mission

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Q12: How does the incarnation provide a model for mission?

**Answer**: The incarnation provides a model for mission because it shows how God chose to redeem the world—not from a distance, but by entering into the very fabric of human existence. Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us. He did not remain separate or distant, but entered into our world, our culture, our struggles, our joys.

This same pattern must characterize our approach to mission. We are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach. The incarnation is not just a theological doctrine; it is a missional methodology. It shows us how to engage in mission—by entering into the lives and contexts of those we are seeking to reach.

Just as Jesus became vulnerable by taking on human flesh, so we must embrace vulnerability in mission. Just as Jesus entered into our world, so we must enter into the worlds of those we are seeking to reach. The incarnation is both the means and the model for mission.

**Key Points**:
- The incarnation shows how God chose to redeem the world
- Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us—entered into our world
- This same pattern must characterize our approach to mission
- The incarnation is both the means and the model for mission

**Examples**:
- Jesus entered into human existence fully
- We are called to enter into the lives of those we seek to reach
- The incarnation provides the pattern for our mission

**Related Concepts**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple Making

### Q13: What is the "sneeze-like" pattern of the missional impulse?

**Answer**: The "sneeze-like" pattern refers to the viral nature of the missional impulse. Just as a sneeze spreads particles outward in a pattern, so the missional impulse spreads the gospel outward through relational networks. This pattern is centrifugal—moving outward from a center—rather than centripetal—drawing inward to a center.

The missional impulse creates this sneeze-like pattern because it is easily transferable along relational lines. When people encounter the gospel and are transformed, they naturally want to share it with others in their relational networks. This creates a viral spread that moves outward organically.

The attractional model, by contrast, suppresses this sneeze by holding back the impulse to sneeze in the first place. Instead of allowing the gospel to spread outward, it tries to contain it within ecclesial structures. This blocks the natural outward movement that is built into the gospel itself.

**Key Points**:
- The "sneeze-like" pattern refers to the viral spread of the missional impulse
- It is centrifugal—moving outward—rather than centripetal
- Easily transferable along relational networks
- The attractional model suppresses this natural movement

**Examples**:
- Early church spread through relational networks
- Contemporary movements spread organically through relationships
- Attractional churches try to contain rather than release

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Q14: How do we find "people of peace"?

**Answer**: "People of peace" are local leaders and influencers who are open to spiritual things. These relationships provide organic access to new networks and opportunities for gospel witness. Finding people of peace requires going out, being present, and paying attention to who is open and responsive.

Look for people who are already asking spiritual questions, who are open to conversation, who have influence in their networks, and who are willing to engage with the gospel. These people often provide natural bridges into communities and networks that would otherwise be difficult to access.

Once found, invest in these relationships. Share meals, spend time together, listen to their stories, and be prepared to share the gospel when opportunities arise. People of peace often become key partners in missional engagement.

**Key Points**:
- People of peace are local leaders open to spiritual things
- They provide organic access to new networks
- Look for those asking spiritual questions and open to conversation
- Invest in these relationships as key partners

**Examples**:
- Local business owners open to spiritual conversation
- Community leaders interested in transformation
- Neighbors asking questions about faith

### Q15: How does hospitality fit into incarnational mission?

**Answer**: Hospitality is essential to incarnational mission because it creates environments where belonging precedes believing. When we regularly share meals with others, especially the marginalized or poor, and host celebrations, we create spaces where people can experience the gospel before they understand it intellectually.

Hospitality is not just about being nice; it is about creating environments where the kingdom of God can be experienced. It is about practicing inclusive, joyful hospitality modeled on Jesus's own approach. Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners, creating spaces where they could encounter the gospel.

In incarnational mission, hospitality becomes a primary practice. We share meals regularly, host celebrations, and create environments where people can belong before they believe. This creates natural opportunities for relationship, conversation, and gospel witness.

**Key Points**:
- Hospitality creates environments where belonging precedes believing
- Share meals regularly, especially with the marginalized
- Host celebrations that model the kingdom
- Creates natural opportunities for relationship and witness

**Examples**:
- Regular meal sharing with neighbors
- Hosting community celebrations
- Creating spaces where people can belong

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Liminality-Communitas

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 4

### Q16: What is the difference between contextualization and accommodation?

**Answer**: Contextualization makes the gospel accessible and understandable in each cultural context without compromising its essential truth. It requires understanding the culture, learning the language, engaging with the worldview, and finding ways to communicate the gospel that resonate with that culture. The goal is to maintain the essential truth of the gospel while adapting our methods.

Accommodation, by contrast, compromises the essential truth of the gospel in order to fit into the culture. It changes the message, not just the methods. It seeks to make the gospel palatable by removing its challenging or offensive elements.

The key difference is that contextualization maintains gospel integrity while adapting methods, while accommodation compromises gospel integrity to fit culture. Contextualization requires deep cultural understanding and theological clarity. Accommodation requires neither.

**Key Points**:
- Contextualization maintains gospel truth while adapting methods
- Accommodation compromises gospel truth to fit culture
- Contextualization requires cultural understanding and theological clarity
- Accommodation seeks to make the gospel palatable by removing challenges

**Examples**:
- Learning local language and customs (contextualization)
- Removing challenging teachings to fit culture (accommodation)
- Finding cultural forms that communicate truth (contextualization)

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Jesus is Lord

### Q17: How does the missional-incarnational impulse create multiplication?

**Answer**: The missional-incarnational impulse creates multiplication because it spreads the gospel through relational networks in a viral, "sneeze-like" pattern. When people encounter the gospel and are transformed, they naturally want to share it with others in their relational networks. This creates organic multiplication that moves outward.

The incarnational aspect enables multiplication because it embeds the gospel deeply in the host culture. When the gospel is embodied authentically in a culture, it becomes reproducible within that culture. People can see it, experience it, and pass it on to others.

The missional aspect enables multiplication because it creates the outward movement that allows the gospel to spread. Instead of containing the gospel within ecclesial structures, it releases it to spread organically through relational networks.

**Key Points**:
- Missional-incarnational impulse spreads through relational networks
- Creates viral, "sneeze-like" pattern of multiplication
- Incarnational aspect embeds gospel deeply, making it reproducible
- Missional aspect creates outward movement that allows spread

**Examples**:
- Early church spread through relational networks
- Contemporary movements multiply organically
- Gospel embedded in culture becomes reproducible

**Related Concepts**: Organic Systems, Disciple Making

### Q18: How do we measure effectiveness in missional-incarnational mission?

**Answer**: Measuring effectiveness in missional-incarnational mission requires different metrics than attractional approaches. Instead of measuring how many people come to us, we measure how many people we are going to. Instead of measuring attendance, we measure engagement. Instead of measuring programs, we measure presence.

Key metrics include: proximity (are we present in the community?), frequency (are we regularly engaging?), relationships (are we building genuine friendships?), engagement (are people participating in community life?), transformation (are lives being changed?), and multiplication (is the gospel spreading?).

The goal is not to measure success by attractional standards, but by missional-incarnational standards. Are we going? Are we present? Are we engaging? Are we transforming? Are we multiplying?

**Key Points**:
- Different metrics than attractional approaches
- Measure going, not coming; engagement, not attendance
- Key metrics: proximity, frequency, relationships, engagement, transformation, multiplication
- Measure by missional-incarnational standards, not attractional

**Examples**:
- Number of people we are going to, not coming to us
- Quality of relationships, not quantity of contacts
- Evidence of transformation, not just information transfer

**Related Concepts**: Disciple Making, Organic Systems

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6; *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, Chapter 4

### Q19: How does the missional-incarnational impulse relate to cultural distance?

**Answer**: The missional-incarnational impulse becomes increasingly important as cultural distance increases. The attractional model is effective only in m0–m1 contexts—where there is little cultural distance between the church and the culture. As cultural complexity and distance increase, the attractional model becomes less and less effective.

The missional-incarnational model, by contrast, can bridge cultural distance. By going to them and becoming part of them, we can reach people that the attractional model cannot reach. The incarnational aspect enables us to understand and engage with different cultures, while the missional aspect enables us to go where we would not naturally go.

This is why the missional-incarnational impulse is essential for reaching diverse cultures and contexts. It enables us to go beyond our own cultural boundaries and engage authentically with people from different backgrounds.

**Key Points**:
- Attractional model effective only in low cultural distance (m0–m1)
- Missional-incarnational model can bridge cultural distance
- Incarnational aspect enables understanding and engagement
- Missional aspect enables going beyond cultural boundaries

**Examples**:
- Early church went to diverse cultures (missional-incarnational)
- Contemporary cross-cultural mission requires missional-incarnational approach
- Urban mission requires bridging cultural distance

**Related Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional, Disciple Making

**Sources**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Q20: What is the relationship between the missional-incarnational impulse and the Great Commission?

**Answer**: The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) establishes both the missional (go) and the incarnational (make disciples of all nations) aspects of our calling. The command to "go" establishes the missional impulse—we are sent into all the world. The command to "make disciples of all nations" implies an incarnational approach—we must understand and engage with different cultures to make disciples.

The Great Commission sends us, but it also tells us how we are to be sent—as those who make disciples. Making disciples requires presence, participation, and relationship. It requires becoming part of the communities we are seeking to reach. This is the incarnational aspect.

The missional-incarnational impulse is the practical outworking of the Great Commission. It is how we fulfill the command to go and make disciples of all nations. We go (missional) and we become part of the communities we reach (incarnational) in order to make disciples.

**Key Points**:
- Great Commission establishes both missional (go) and incarnational (make disciples) aspects
- Command to "go" establishes missional impulse
- Command to "make disciples of all nations" implies incarnational approach
- Missional-incarnational impulse is the practical outworking of the Great Commission

**Examples**:
- Early church went to all nations and became part of communities
- Contemporary mission requires both going and becoming part of communities
