# Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for implementing the missional-incarnational impulse in community life  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers, missional communities  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

---

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for implementing the missional-incarnational impulse—the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. This is not about adding outreach programs, but about fundamentally reorienting our approach from attractional (come-to-us) to missional (go-to-them) and from surface contact to deep embedding. This guide walks through the process of shifting paradigms, developing habits for going out and going deep, and creating sustainable practices for missional-incarnational engagement.

Whether you are starting a new missional community or seeking to renew an existing one, this guide offers concrete steps for making the missional-incarnational impulse central to your community's life. The process involves assessment, paradigm shift, habit development, and ongoing engagement. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive approach to recovering this essential mDNA element.

This guide is designed for communities that are serious about becoming missional movements. It requires commitment, courage, and a willingness to let go of attractional approaches. The reward is the transformative power that comes when the missional-incarnational impulse is fully activated—the same power that transformed the early church, the Celtic mission, and contemporary movements around the world.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **What is your primary approach to mission?**
   - Are you primarily attractional (come-to-us) or missional (go-to-them)?
   - Do you measure success by attendance or by engagement?
   - Are you going out or asking people to come in?

2. **How incarnational is your engagement?**
   - Are you present in the community or separate from it?
   - Do you participate in community life or observe from outside?
   - Are you becoming part of the community or remaining separate?

3. **What is your cultural distance?**
   - Are you in an m0–m1 context (low cultural distance)?
   - Are you trying to reach beyond your cultural comfort zone?
   - Is the attractional model still effective, or do you need missional approaches?

4. **How integrated are mission and incarnation?**
   - Are mission and incarnation working together or separately?
   - Do you go but remain separate, or go and become part of?
   - Is there risk of colonial approaches or accommodation?

5. **What are your current practices?**
   - Do you have habits for going out (proximity, frequency, spontaneity)?
   - Do you have habits for going deep (meaningful engagement, proclamation)?
   - Are these practices central or peripheral?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: The Missional-Attractional Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether your approach is primarily missional or attractional

**How to Use**:
1. Evaluate each aspect of your mission approach
2. Rate on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very attractional, 5 = very missional)
3. Identify areas that are primarily attractional
4. Develop plan to shift toward missional

**Scoring**:
- 5 = Very missional (go-to-them, centrifugal)
- 4 = Mostly missional
- 3 = Mixed (some missional, some attractional)
- 2 = Mostly attractional
- 1 = Very attractional (come-to-us, centripetal)

#### Tool 2: The Incarnational Engagement Inventory

**Purpose**: Assess how incarnational your engagement is

**How to Use**:
1. Evaluate presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership
2. Rate each on a scale of 1-5
3. Identify areas needing improvement
4. Develop specific action plans

**Scoring**:
- 5 = Fully incarnational (present, participating, proclaiming, partnering)
- 4 = Mostly incarnational
- 3 = Partially incarnational
- 2 = Rarely incarnational
- 1 = Not incarnational (separate, observing, not engaging)

#### Tool 3: The Cultural Distance Evaluation

**Purpose**: Assess cultural distance and determine appropriate approach

**How to Use**:
1. Evaluate cultural distance from your community to target context
2. Determine if you are in m0–m1 (low distance) or beyond (high distance)
3. Assess if attractional approaches are still effective
4. Determine if missional-incarnational approaches are needed

**Scoring**: 
- m0 = No cultural distance (same culture)
- m1 = Low cultural distance (similar culture)
- m2+ = High cultural distance (different culture, requires missional-incarnational)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Remaining Attractional

**Description**: Trying to add missional practices while keeping attractional approaches primary

**Why It Happens**: Comfort with existing approaches, fear of change, misunderstanding of the shift

**How to Avoid**:
- Make the shift primary, not additive
- Change metrics from attendance to engagement
- Reduce attractional activities, increase missional activities
- Resist the temptation to do both equally

**If You're Already There**: Make a clear shift. Reduce attractional activities and increase missional activities. Change metrics.

### Pitfall 2: Going Without Becoming Part Of

**Description**: Going to communities but remaining separate (colonial approach)

**Why It Happens**: Fear of losing identity, comfort with separation, misunderstanding of incarnation

**How to Avoid**:
- Emphasize presence, participation, and partnership
- Move into neighborhoods, not just visit
- Participate in community life, not just observe
- Work alongside, not above, the community

**If You're Already There**: Increase incarnational engagement. Move from visiting to participating. Become part of rather than separate from.

### Pitfall 3: Becoming Part Of Without Mission

**Description**: Becoming part of community but losing missional focus (accommodation)

**Why It Happens**: Desire to fit in, fear of being different, losing gospel focus

**How to Avoid**:
- Maintain gospel integrity while adapting methods
- Keep missional focus clear
- Regular reflection on mission and incarnation integration
- Accountability for maintaining both

**If You're Already There**: Recover missional focus. Remember you are sent. Maintain gospel integrity while being part of the community.

### Pitfall 4: Surface Engagement

**Description**: Going out but not going deep—remaining on the surface

**Why It Happens**: Comfort with surface relationships, fear of deep engagement, lack of time

**How to Avoid**:
- Develop habits for going deep
- Invest time in meaningful relationships
- Participate in community life, not just observe
- Practice hospitality and proclamation

**If You're Already There**: Increase depth of engagement. Invest more time. Build deeper relationships. Participate more fully.

### Pitfall 5: Programmatic Approach

**Description**: Turning missional-incarnational into programs rather than way of life

**Why It Happens**: Familiarity with programmatic approaches, desire for structure, misunderstanding

**How to Avoid**:
- Emphasize way of life, not programs
- Focus on habits and practices, not events
- Make it organic, not structured
- Resist programmatic thinking

**If You're Already There**: Shift from programs to practices. Focus on habits and way of life. Make it organic and relational.
