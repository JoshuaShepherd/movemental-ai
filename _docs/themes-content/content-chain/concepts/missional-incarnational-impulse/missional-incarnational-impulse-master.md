## Executive Summary

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. This mDNA element links two discrete theological motivators that combine to extend the impact of the gospel and embed the Jesus story deeply into the host culture. Jesus himself charged us with these words: "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you." We are being sent, but we are also being told how we are to be sent—as embodied message, incarnationally.

The missional impulse is the outward thrust rooted in God's mission that compels the church to reach a lost world. It is a sending rather than an attractional approach—centrifugal rather than centripetal. The incarnational impulse refers to the way in which the gospel is embodied and embedded in the host culture. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach.

**Key Points:**
- The missional-incarnational impulse links mission and incarnation as one integrated reality
- The missional impulse is centrifugal (go-to-them) rather than centripetal (come-to-us)
- The incarnational impulse requires presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership
- Mission without incarnation becomes colonial; incarnation without mission becomes accommodation
- The attractional model blocks the outward-bound movement built into the gospel
- We must shift from attractional to missional, from come-to-us to go-to-them

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. This mDNA element links two discrete theological motivators that combine to extend the impact of the gospel and embed the Jesus story deeply into the host culture. Jesus himself charged us with these words: "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you." We are being sent, but we are also being told how we are to be sent—as embodied message, incarnationally.

The missional impulse is the outward thrust rooted in God's mission that compels the church to reach a lost world. It is a sending rather than an attractional approach—centrifugal rather than centripetal. The New Testament pattern of mission is centrifugal (go-to-them) rather than centripetal (come-to-us). When Jesus likens the kingdom of God to seeds being sown, he is not kidding. The missional impulse creates a viral "sneeze-like" pattern of outward movement.

The incarnational impulse is the second critical element of this mDNA. It refers to the way in which the gospel is embodied and embedded in the host culture. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach. The incarnation is not just a theological doctrine; it is a missional methodology. It is how God chose to redeem the world—not from a distance, but by entering into the very fabric of human existence.

The missional-incarnational impulse is not two separate things, but one integrated reality. Mission without incarnation becomes colonial and exploitative. Incarnation without mission becomes accommodation and compromise. Together, they create a powerful force for transformation.

### Common Misunderstandings

Many contemporary Christians misunderstand the missional-incarnational impulse by confusing it with evangelistic outreach or attractional methods. They think mission is about getting people to come to church, or about programs designed to attract people. They reduce incarnation to cultural relevance or contextualization without the deeper commitment to presence and participation.

The biblical understanding is far more radical. Mission is about going, not about coming. It is centrifugal, not centripetal. Incarnation is about becoming part of the community, not just visiting it. It requires presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership. It is not about making the gospel palatable, but about embodying it authentically in the host culture.

### Why It Matters

The missional-incarnational impulse matters because it is the practical outworking of the mission of God (the missio Dei) together with the New Testament teaching of the incarnation of God in Jesus. It is thus rooted in the very way that God redeemed the world and in how God revealed himself to us. Unless we embrace this dynamic, we will hinder our capacity to sow the seeds of transformational impact and multiplication.

It matters because the attractional model blocks the outward-bound movement that is built into the message of the gospel itself. Instead of being sown in the wind, the seeds are put into ecclesial storehouses, thus effectively extinguishing the purpose for which seeds were made. The attractional model quite simply can never hope to impact the broader culture as Jesus movements can.

It matters because it enables the church to reach beyond cultural barriers, create authentic relationships, demonstrate the gospel, multiply impact, and transform communities. When the missional-incarnational impulse is fully activated, it creates a powerful force for transformation.

### Biblical Foundations

The biblical foundation for the missional-incarnational impulse begins with Jesus's commission: "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you" (John 20:21). This establishes both the fact that we are sent (missional) and the way we are to be sent (incarnationally). We are being sent in the same way in which the Son was sent—as embodied message.

The incarnation itself provides the model. Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14). He entered into the very fabric of human existence, not remaining at a distance. This same pattern must characterize our approach to mission. We are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach.

The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) sends us into all the world, but it also implies an incarnational approach. We are to make disciples of all nations, which requires understanding and engaging with different cultures. The early church's pattern of going to the ends of the earth while becoming part of the communities they reached demonstrates this integration.

### Theological Framework

The missional-incarnational impulse fits into the broader theological framework of the missio Dei (mission of God) and the incarnation. It represents the intersection of missiology, Christology, and ecclesiology—how God works in the world, how Christ reveals God, and how the church participates in God's mission.

From a missiological perspective, mission is not merely an activity of the church, but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a "missionary God," and the church is a "sent people." Mission means "sending," and it is the central biblical theme describing the purpose of God's action in human history.

From a Christological perspective, the incarnation reveals how God chooses to work in the world. God did not remain at a distance, but entered into the very fabric of human existence. This same pattern must characterize our approach to mission.

From an ecclesiological perspective, the church is a sent people, called to participate in God's mission. The church exists not for itself, but for the world. It is sent into the world to be salt and light, to embody the kingdom of God in every context.

### Historical Examples

The early church provides the primary historical example of the missional-incarnational impulse in action. The apostles and early Christians went to the ends of the earth, but they also became part of the communities they reached. They learned languages, engaged with cultures, and lived among the people they were seeking to reach.

The Celtic mission offers another example. Celtic missionaries like Patrick and Columba went to pagan lands and lived among the people, learning their language and culture. They did not remain separate, but became part of the communities they served.

The Moravian movement provides another example. The Moravians sent missionaries around the world, but they also established communities that lived out the gospel in their contexts. They combined missional sending with incarnational presence.

The Chinese underground church offers a contemporary example. Despite persecution, Chinese Christians have maintained their witness by living incarnationally in their communities. They have gone where the church could not go, and they have become part of the communities they serve.

### Evolution of Thought

Alan's thinking on the missional-incarnational impulse was first developed in *The Shaping of Things to Come* (2003, with Michael Frost), where he explored the shift from attractional to missional approaches. In *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), he established it as a critical element of mDNA, linking mission and incarnation as one integrated reality. In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), he provided practical habits and practices for missional-incarnational living.

The concept has been refined to emphasize the integration of missional and incarnational impulses—they are not two separate things, but one reality. The contrast with attractional-evangelistic approaches has been strengthened, showing how the attractional model blocks the outward-bound movement built into the gospel. The practical framework of presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation has been developed and applied.

## 3. Subtopics and Stories

### Key Subtopics

#### The Missional Impulse (Outward Thrust)

The missional impulse is the outward thrust rooted in God's mission that compels the church to reach a lost world. It is a sending rather than an attractional approach—centrifugal rather than centripetal. The New Testament pattern of mission is centrifugal (go-to-them) rather than centripetal (come-to-us). When Jesus likens the kingdom of God to seeds being sown, he is not kidding. The missional impulse creates a viral "sneeze-like" pattern of outward movement.

All authentic mission is inspired by this go-to-them (sent) approach. It is how we all got here and how we pass our own stories and DNA on to our descendants. The Christendom template tends to bolt down the missional (sent and sending) impulse by relying almost exclusively on come-and-get-it attractional approaches. The net effect of using attractional evangelism only is to unwittingly block the outward-bound movement that is built into the message of the gospel itself.

#### The Incarnational Impulse (Embedding the Gospel)

The incarnational impulse is the second critical element of this mDNA. It refers to the way in which the gospel is embodied and embedded in the host culture. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach. The incarnation is not just a theological doctrine; it is a missional methodology. It is how God chose to redeem the world—not from a distance, but by entering into the very fabric of human existence.

Key principles of incarnational mission include presence (being physically present in communities), participation (engaging with the life of the community), proclamation (communicating the gospel through words and life), and partnership (working alongside the community, not above it).

#### Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Proclamation

Michael Frost developed the EPIC framework for incarnational mission: Presence (God, in Jesus, moved into the neighborhood), Proximity (Jesus engaged people from all walks of life), Powerlessness (serve with humility and reject power-based leadership), and Proclamation (be prepared to share the gospel wherever you go). This framework provides practical guidance for incarnational engagement.

#### Going Out (The Outward Movement)

The "out" habit is about moving God's people into the hub of life, fostering mission through proximity (moving into neighborhoods, spending time in local gathering places), frequency (regularly visiting the same places to build familiarity), and spontaneity (making space for impromptu connection). This involves minimizing "in-house" meetings and investing time in community presence.

#### Going Deep (The Embedding Movement)

Deepening refers to embedding the gospel within the fabric of community through meaningful relationships and engagement. This involves meaningful engagement (investing time in genuine friendships, participating in rites of passage), proclamation (sharing the gospel relationally and conversationally), holy living (living lives that embody the message), hospitality (regularly sharing meals, hosting celebrations), contextualizing community (encouraging new Christian communities to form their own expressions), and sending (continuing to send out teams to seed and embed the gospel).

#### The Attractional Model vs. The Missional Model

The attractional model relies on come-and-get-it approaches that are effective in m0–m1 contexts but much less so beyond them. Christendom forms of church are good at harvesting the low-hanging cultural fruit but have no real vision, understanding, and method of how to reach beyond a merely evangelistic approach to context. The strategy is to stimulate numerical growth through better programming, improved plant and resources, and effective marketing.

The missional model, by contrast, is centrifugal rather than centripetal. It goes to them rather than asking them to come to us. It embeds the gospel in the host culture rather than expecting the culture to adapt to the church. It creates movements that spread organically through relational networks rather than through programs and marketing.

### Stories and Examples

#### The Uffizi Order

Jeff Shaffer founded the Uffizi Order, an agency dedicated to incarnational mission in Santa Barbara. He observed: "I have always felt the need to take the message of Jesus into all the nooks and crannies of Santa Barbara, to the very places where the church has had little or no interest and even less impact. As an apostolic and prophetic agency, Uffizi Order exists to transform Santa Barbara into a little outpost of the kingdom; to eliminate homelessness, to stop trafficking, to plant churches, see people saved, and to bring tangible justice to those who are rejected and oppressed in any way. We are responsible, we will go, we will do whatever it takes."

This demonstrates the selfsame energies that imbue missional movements in every time and place—the commitment to go, to be present, to engage, and to transform.

#### The Early Church

The early church provides the primary historical example. The apostles and early Christians went to the ends of the earth, but they also became part of the communities they reached. They learned languages, engaged with cultures, and lived among the people they were seeking to reach. This combination of missional sending and incarnational presence created a movement that transformed the Roman Empire.

#### The Celtic Mission

Celtic missionaries like Patrick and Columba went to pagan lands and lived among the people, learning their language and culture. They did not remain separate, but became part of the communities they served. This incarnational approach enabled them to reach people that other approaches could not reach.

#### The Moravian Movement

The Moravians sent missionaries around the world, but they also established communities that lived out the gospel in their contexts. They combined missional sending with incarnational presence, creating a movement that had global impact while maintaining deep local engagement.

#### The Chinese Underground Church

Despite persecution, Chinese Christians have maintained their witness by living incarnationally in their communities. They have gone where the church could not go, and they have become part of the communities they serve. This incarnational approach has enabled them to grow from 2 million to 120 million despite persecution.

### Practical Applications

#### Going Out: Proximity, Frequency, Spontaneity

The "out" habit involves moving God's people into the hub of life. Practice proximity by moving into neighborhoods where mission is focused and spending time in local gathering places (cafés, sports clubs, pubs, parks). Practice frequency by regularly visiting the same places to build familiarity, shopping at the same local stores, attending school pickup or community events regularly, and sharing meals or social time with both group and non-group members. Practice spontaneity by making space for impromptu connection, reordering schedules to allow for spontaneity, minimizing "in-house" meetings, and organizing gatherings with flexibility.

#### Going Deep: Meaningful Engagement and Proclamation

Deepening involves embedding the gospel within the fabric of community. Practice meaningful engagement by investing time in genuine friendships, participating in rites of passage (weddings, funerals, birthdays), learning and practicing the art of meaningful conversation and active listening, and strengthening networks of connected relationships. Practice proclamation by sharing the gospel relationally and conversationally, exciting curiosity through stories, exploring spiritual questions, and assuming God is already at work in every person's life.

#### Hospitality and Contextualization

Practice hospitality by regularly sharing meals with others, especially the marginalized or poor, hosting celebrations, and creating environments where belonging precedes believing. Practice contextualization by encouraging new Christian communities to form their own expressions, contextualized to the surrounding culture, listening deeply to the community's story, needs, and rhythms, and redeeming and affirming what is good while gently challenging what is not.

### Common Questions Addressed

- What is the difference between missional and attractional approaches?
- How do we shift from come-to-us to go-to-them?
- What does it mean to live incarnationally?
- How do presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation work together?
- What is the relationship between mission and incarnation?
- How do we avoid colonial or exploitative approaches?
- How do we maintain gospel integrity while contextualizing?

### Misconceptions and Corrections

**Misconception**: Mission is about getting people to come to church.

**Correction**: Mission is about going to them, not asking them to come to us. It is centrifugal, not centripetal.

**Misconception**: Incarnation is just about cultural relevance or contextualization.

**Correction**: Incarnation requires presence, participation, proclamation, and partnership. It is about becoming part of the community, not just visiting it.

**Misconception**: Mission and incarnation are two separate things.

**Correction**: They are one integrated reality. Mission without incarnation becomes colonial; incarnation without mission becomes accommodation.

**Misconception**: The attractional model is just as effective as the missional model.

**Correction**: The attractional model is effective only in m0–m1 contexts. It cannot reach beyond cultural barriers or create authentic movements.

**Misconception**: Incarnational mission means compromising the gospel.

**Correction**: Incarnational mission means embodying the gospel authentically in the host culture while maintaining gospel integrity.

### Connections to Other Concepts

**Connection to Jesus is Lord**: The lordship of Jesus provides missional clarity. We go where Jesus leads, we do what Jesus commands, we become what Jesus intends. The missional-incarnational impulse flows from the recognition that Jesus is Lord of all.

**Connection to Disciple Making**: Discipleship is lived out in mission. We are sent as disciples who make disciples. Mission flows from discipleship, and discipleship is lived out in mission.

**Connection to Apostolic Environment**: The fivefold ministry sends and equips for mission. Apostolic leaders pioneer new ground, prophetic leaders challenge the status quo, evangelistic leaders communicate the gospel, shepherding leaders nurture communities, and teaching leaders provide wisdom for engagement.

**Connection to Organic Systems**: Simple, reproducible patterns emerge for missional engagement. The missional-incarnational impulse creates organic multiplication through relational networks.

**Connection to Liminality-Communitas**: The intense community that forms when people share the mission creates the conditions for missional engagement. Liminality-communitas and missional-incarnational impulse work together to create transformative movement.

## 4. Scripture Reference Index

### Primary Scripture References

#### John 20:21

**Text**: "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you."

**Context**: Jesus's commission to his disciples after the resurrection

**Alan's Interpretation**: This establishes both the fact that we are sent (missional) and the way we are to be sent (incarnationally). We are being sent in the same way in which the Son was sent—as embodied message. This is the foundational text for the missional-incarnational impulse.

**Theological Significance**: This connects our mission to God's mission and establishes the incarnational pattern for how we are to be sent.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

#### John 1:14

**Text**: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."

**Context**: John's prologue describing the incarnation

**Alan's Interpretation**: The incarnation provides the model for how we are to engage in mission. Just as Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh and dwell among those we are seeking to reach. The incarnation is not just a theological doctrine; it is a missional methodology.

**Theological Significance**: The incarnation reveals how God chooses to work in the world—not from a distance, but by entering into the very fabric of human existence.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

#### Matthew 28:18-20 (The Great Commission)

**Text**: "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."

**Context**: Jesus's final commission to his disciples

**Alan's Interpretation**: This sends us into all the world, but it also implies an incarnational approach. We are to make disciples of all nations, which requires understanding and engaging with different cultures. The command to "go" establishes the missional impulse.

**Theological Significance**: The Great Commission establishes both the missional (go) and the incarnational (make disciples of all nations) aspects of our calling.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

#### Acts 1:8

**Text**: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

**Context**: Jesus's final words before ascending

**Alan's Interpretation**: This establishes the pattern of going from local to global, from familiar to unfamiliar. It implies both missional sending and incarnational presence in each context.

**Theological Significance**: This shows the expansion pattern of mission—going to the ends of the earth while being present in each context.

## 6. Historical Development

### Early Formulations

Alan's thinking on the missional-incarnational impulse was first developed in *The Shaping of Things to Come* (2003, with Michael Frost), where he explored the shift from attractional to missional approaches and developed the framework of presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation.

### Refinements

In *The Forgotten Ways* (2006), Alan established the missional-incarnational impulse as a critical element of mDNA, linking mission and incarnation as one integrated reality. He contrasted it with the attractional-evangelistic approach, showing how the attractional model blocks the outward-bound movement built into the gospel.

In *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (2009), Alan provided practical habits and practices for missional-incarnational living, including "Going Out" (proximity, frequency, spontaneity) and "Going Deep" (meaningful engagement, proclamation, hospitality).

### Current Understanding

Alan's current understanding emphasizes that the missional-incarnational impulse is not two separate things, but one integrated reality. Mission without incarnation becomes colonial and exploitative. Incarnation without mission becomes accommodation and compromise. Together, they create a powerful force for transformation.

The contrast with attractional-evangelistic approaches has been strengthened, showing how the attractional model is effective only in m0–m1 contexts and cannot reach beyond cultural barriers. The practical framework of presence, proximity, powerlessness, and proclamation has been developed and applied in various contexts.

## 7. Common Objections and Responses

### Objection 1: "The attractional model has been effective—why change?"

**Alan's Response**: The attractional model is effective only in m0–m1 contexts—where there is little cultural distance between the church and the culture. As cultural complexity increases, the attractional model becomes less and less effective. It is good at harvesting the low-hanging cultural fruit but has no real vision, understanding, and method of how to reach beyond a merely evangelistic approach to context. The missional-incarnational model can reach where the attractional model cannot.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Objection 2: "This sounds too risky—what if we lose people?"

**Alan's Response**: The missional-incarnational impulse is not about losing people, but about reaching people that the attractional model cannot reach. It is about going to them rather than asking them to come to us. The risk is not in going, but in staying. When we stay in our comfort zones, we block the outward-bound movement that is built into the gospel itself.

**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6

### Objection 3: "This requires too much time and commitment."

**Alan's Response**: Incarnational mission does require time and commitment, but this is precisely its power. It cannot be rushed or forced. It takes time to build relationships, to understand culture, to embed the gospel. But this investment pays dividends in authentic transformation and lasting impact. The attractional model may seem faster, but it cannot create the deep transformation that incarnational mission creates.

### Objection 4: "This sounds like compromising the gospel."

**Alan's Response**: Incarnational mission is not about compromising the gospel, but about embodying it authentically in the host culture. It requires maintaining gospel integrity while adapting our methods to different contexts. The goal is not to make the gospel palatable, but to make it accessible and understandable in each cultural context.

### Objection 5: "We can do both—attractional and missional."

**Alan's Response**: While there may be a place for attractional approaches in certain contexts, the primary pattern must be missional-incarnational. The attractional model tends to dominate and block the missional impulse. When we rely primarily on attractional approaches, we unwittingly block the outward-bound movement that is built into the gospel itself. The missional-incarnational impulse must be primary.
