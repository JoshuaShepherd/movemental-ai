## Core Definition

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. This mDNA element links two discrete theological motivators that combine to extend the impact of the gospel and embed the Jesus story deeply into the host culture. Jesus himself charged us: "Just as the Father sends me, so I send you." We are being sent, but we are also being told how we are to be sent—as embodied message, incarnationally. The missional impulse is the outward thrust (go-to-them) that compels the church to reach a lost world. The incarnational impulse is the way in which the gospel is embodied and embedded in the host culture (becoming flesh and dwelling among them).

## Key Points

1. **Twin Impulses, One Reality**
   - Mission and incarnation are not two separate things, but one integrated reality
   - Mission without incarnation becomes colonial and exploitative
   - Incarnation without mission becomes accommodation and compromise
   - Together, they create a powerful force for transformation

2. **Centrifugal vs. Centripetal**
   - The missional impulse is centrifugal (go-to-them) rather than centripetal (come-to-us)
   - The New Testament pattern of mission is sending, not attraction
   - The attractional model blocks the outward-bound movement built into the gospel
   - Seeds must be sown in the wind, not stored in ecclesial storehouses

3. **Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Proclamation**
   - Presence: God, in Jesus, moved into the neighborhood
   - Proximity: Jesus engaged people from all walks of life
   - Powerlessness: Serve with humility and reject power-based leadership
   - Proclamation: Be prepared to share the gospel wherever you go

4. **Going Out and Going Deep**
   - Going Out: Proximity (move into neighborhoods), Frequency (regular presence), Spontaneity (impromptu connection)
   - Going Deep: Meaningful engagement, Proclamation, Holy living, Hospitality, Contextualization, Sending

5. **The Attractional Model's Limitations**
   - Effective only in m0–m1 contexts (low cultural distance)
   - Good at harvesting low-hanging fruit but cannot reach beyond
   - Blocks the outward-bound movement built into the gospel
   - Cannot impact broader culture as Jesus movements can

6. **Rooted in God's Mission**
   - The missional-incarnational impulse is the practical outworking of the missio Dei
   - It is rooted in how God redeemed the world and revealed himself
   - God is a "missionary God," and the church is a "sent people"
   - The incarnation is not just doctrine; it is missional methodology

7. **Historical Effectiveness**
   - The early church went to the ends of the earth while becoming part of communities
   - Celtic missionaries lived among the people, learning language and culture
   - The Moravian movement combined sending with incarnational presence
   - The Chinese underground church maintained witness through incarnational living
