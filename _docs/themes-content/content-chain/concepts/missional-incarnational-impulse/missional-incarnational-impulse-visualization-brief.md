## Concept Overview

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin impulses of mission and incarnation that drive authentic Jesus movements. Visual representations should convey both the outward movement (missional) and the embedding process (incarnational), showing how these two impulses work together as one integrated reality. The visual challenge is to communicate the centrifugal (go-to-them) nature of mission versus the centripetal (come-to-us) nature of attractional approaches, and to show how incarnation requires presence, participation, and partnership.

## Visual Metaphors

### The Sneeze Pattern

**Description**: The missional impulse creates a viral "sneeze-like" pattern of outward movement. Just as a sneeze spreads particles outward in a pattern, so the missional impulse spreads the gospel outward through relational networks. This metaphor emphasizes the centrifugal, viral nature of missional movement.

**Visual Elements**: 
- Central point (source)
- Outward spreading pattern (like sneeze particles)
- Relational connections showing spread
- Movement and flow emphasized

**Use Cases**: Diagrams showing missional spread, multiplication patterns, movement expansion visuals

### The Seed Sown in the Wind

**Description**: The missional impulse is like seeds being sown in the wind—they spread outward naturally, finding fertile ground where they land. This metaphor emphasizes the natural, organic spread of the gospel when it is released rather than contained.

**Visual Elements**:
- Seeds being scattered
- Wind carrying seeds outward
- Seeds landing in different places
- Growth from seeds that land

**Use Cases**: Multiplication diagrams, spread patterns, organic growth illustrations

### The Embodiment/Embedding

**Description**: The incarnational impulse is like becoming part of the fabric of a community—embedding oneself deeply rather than remaining on the surface. This metaphor emphasizes presence, participation, and becoming part of rather than separate from.

**Visual Elements**:
- Integration into fabric/community
- Deep embedding rather than surface contact
- Becoming part of rather than separate from
- Presence and participation emphasized

**Use Cases**: Incarnational engagement diagrams, community integration visuals, presence illustrations

### The Centrifugal vs. Centripetal

**Description**: The contrast between missional (centrifugal, outward) and attractional (centripetal, inward) approaches. This metaphor emphasizes the fundamental difference in direction and movement.

**Visual Elements**:
- Centrifugal: Movement outward from center
- Centripetal: Movement inward to center
- Clear contrast in direction
- Arrows showing movement patterns

**Use Cases**: Comparison diagrams, paradigm shift visuals, approach contrast illustrations

## Process Flows

### The Missional-Incarnational Process

**Steps**:
1. Go (missional impulse - outward movement)
2. Be Present (incarnational impulse - physical presence)
3. Participate (engaging with community life)
4. Proclaim (sharing the gospel through words and life)
5. Embed (gospel becomes part of the culture)
6. Multiply (gospel spreads through relational networks)

**Visual Flow**: Circular or spiral process showing integration of missional and incarnational

**Decision Points**: Key moments where choices must be made (e.g., commitment to presence, willingness to participate)

### Going Out and Going Deep

**Steps**:
1. Going Out: Proximity, Frequency, Spontaneity
2. Going Deep: Meaningful Engagement, Proclamation, Holy Living, Hospitality
3. Integration: How going out and going deep work together

**Visual Flow**: Two parallel flows that integrate, showing both outward movement and deep embedding

**Decision Points**: When to go out, when to go deep, how to integrate both

## Additional Notes

The missional-incarnational impulse is both outward movement and deep embedding. Visual representations should capture this dual nature—showing both the centrifugal spread and the incarnational presence. The visual should inspire movement and engagement while showing the integration of mission and incarnation.

Avoid visual elements that suggest separation or compartmentalization. Mission and incarnation are one integrated reality, so visuals should show connection, integration, and unity. Use flowing lines and integrated patterns rather than separate, disconnected elements.

The visual should convey movement and life, not static maintenance. The missional-incarnational impulse creates movement, so visuals should suggest growth, flow, and expansion. Use dynamic patterns that show outward movement and deep embedding.
