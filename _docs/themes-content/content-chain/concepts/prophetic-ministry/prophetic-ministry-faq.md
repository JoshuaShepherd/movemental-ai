## Questions

### Q1: What is prophetic ministry?

**Answer**: Prophetic ministry is the calling, challenging, vision-casting ministry that guards the church's covenant relationship with God. Prophets simultaneously hold two realities: the world as it is, and the world as God intends it to be. They identify gaps between God's reality and human experience and compel communities to confront these discrepancies.

**Key Points**:
- Holds two realities simultaneously
- Guards covenant relationship with God
- Calls back to God and forward to God's future
- Both critical and energizing

### Q2: Do prophets only predict the future?

**Answer**: No. While biblical prophets sometimes spoke about future events, their primary function was calling people to faithfulness in the present. Prophetic ministry is about alignment with God's purposes, not fortune-telling.

**Key Points**:
- Primary function is present faithfulness
- About alignment, not prediction
- Calls to repentance and transformation
- Focuses on God's purposes now

### Q3: Is prophetic ministry only criticism?

**Answer**: No. Prophetic ministry is both critical and energizing. It critiques what fails to honor God while energizing communities toward greater faithfulness. Walter Brueggemann characterizes the prophet as both a critic and energizer.

**Key Points**:
- Both critical and energizing
- Critiques unfaithfulness
- Energizes toward transformation
- Calls to repentance and renewal

### Q4: Are prophets always right?

**Answer**: No. Prophets are not infallible. They are human, fallible, and in need of accountability. Communities should test their insights collectively. Prophets must recognize their own humanity and potential complicity in the issues they decry.

**Key Points**:
- Prophets are human and fallible
- Need accountability and testing
- Must recognize own humanity
- Communities should test insights

### Q5: Can anyone function prophetically?

**Answer**: Yes. Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us"—all believers are endowed with APEST gifting. Prophetic ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a subset of leaders. Every believer can function prophetically, and some are particularly gifted in this area.

**Key Points**:
- Given to all believers
- Some particularly gifted
- Everyone can function prophetically
- Not just for select few

### Q6: How do we receive prophetic ministry without being defensive?

**Answer**: Recognize that prophetic ministry comes from love for God's people. Prophets are guardians of the covenant and must maintain deep love for God's people—even when delivering difficult truths. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Those whom you would change you must first love."

**Key Points**:
- Comes from covenantal love
- Prophets love God's people
- Difficult truths from love
- Receive with humility

### Q7: How does prophetic ministry relate to the other APEST ministries?

**Answer**: Prophetic ministry works alongside other APEST ministries to maintain faithfulness. It helps apostolic ministry stay true to the gospel, ensures evangelistic ministry remains faithful, challenges shepherding to avoid compromise, and keeps teaching aligned with God's purposes.

**Key Points**:
- Works alongside all APEST ministries
- Maintains faithfulness across all
- Provides accountability
- Ensures alignment with God

### Q8: What happens when prophetic ministry is absent?

**Answer**: Churches drift toward unfaithfulness, compromise, and accommodation to culture. They become "zombie organizations"—systematically excluding information that contradicts their reigning reality. They lose their capacity to adapt and remain faithful.

**Key Points**:
- Drift toward unfaithfulness
- Become zombie organizations
- Lose capacity to adapt
- Compromise with culture
