## Core Definition

Prophetic ministry is the calling, challenging, vision-casting ministry that guards the church's covenant relationship with God. Prophets are unique in their ability to simultaneously hold two realities: the world as it is, and the world as God intends it to be. This creates internal tension as they identify gaps between God's reality and human experience—gaps such as injustice, unfaithfulness, indifference toward God, and cruelty. Prophets compel communities to confront these discrepancies, enabling them to recognize the true nature of their situation.

## Key Points

1. **Holding Two Realities**: Prophets simultaneously hold the world as it is and the world as God intends it to be, creating tension that drives prophetic ministry.

2. **Critique and Energizing**: Prophetic ministry is both critical and energizing. It critiques what fails to honor God while energizing communities toward greater faithfulness.

3. **Covenant Guardianship**: Prophets are guardians of the covenant, ensuring that the church remains faithful to God's purposes.

4. **Calling Back and Forward**: Prophets call people both back to God as known in Jesus Christ and forward into God's preferred future.

5. **Confronting Idolatry**: Prophetic ministry confronts personal and collective idolatry, particularly where institutions have legitimized unfaithful worldviews.

6. **Given to All**: Prophetic ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to a select few leaders.

7. **Essential for Faithfulness**: The church cannot remain faithful without prophetic ministry's challenging presence.

## Essential Quotes

> "The prophet's eye is directed to the contemporary scene; the society and its conduct are the main theme of his speeches. Yet his ear is inclined to God. He is a person struck by the glory and presence of God, overpowered by the hand of God. Yet his true greatness is his ability to hold God and man in a single thought."  
> — Abraham Joshua Heschel, quoted in *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 3
