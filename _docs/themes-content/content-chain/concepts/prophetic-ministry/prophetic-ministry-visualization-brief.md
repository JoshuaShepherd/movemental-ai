## Concept Overview

Prophetic ministry holds two realities simultaneously: the world as it is and the world as God intends it to be. It guards the covenant, calls to faithfulness, and energizes transformation. Key visual themes include: two realities (contrast, gap, bridge), covenant (relationship, faithfulness), calling (direction, movement), and transformation (change, renewal).
