## Executive Summary

Shepherding ministry is the caring, protecting, nurturing ministry that centers on nurturing healthy Christian community and caring for people's welfare. Shepherds are the church's relational foundation, fostering formation in Christ by building cohesive, inclusive, and stable communities. Effective shepherds know their community deeply—names, stories, and needs.

Shepherding ministry operates at multiple levels: caring for individuals, building healthy communities, and creating cultures of care that multiply. The shepherding function is about caring for people in ways that help them become who God created them to be. It creates environments where people can grow, heal, and flourish, developing people so they can develop others.

## 1. Definition Report

### Alan's Definition

Shepherding ministry is the caring, protecting, nurturing ministry that centers on nurturing healthy Christian community and caring for people's welfare. Shepherds are the church's relational foundation, fostering formation in Christ by building cohesive, inclusive, and stable communities. Effective shepherds know their community deeply—names, stories, and needs—drawing on Dunbar's Rule that relational networks cap at 120-150 people.

The shepherding function is about caring for people in ways that help them become who God created them to be. It creates environments where people can grow, heal, and flourish. It develops people so they can develop others. The shepherding function multiplies by developing other shepherds and creating cultures of care that multiply.

While driven by harmony, shepherds must beware the shadow side: conflict avoidance, passivity, and excessive conformity. True shepherding accepts healthy dissent and balances unity with genuine relationship. Even as shepherds focus on internal health, their ministry must be connected to God's broader mission. Missional shepherding means caring for the flock so it flourishes and reproduces, participating in the extension of the church's mission alongside apostles and evangelists.

### Common Misunderstandings

**Misunderstanding 1: Shepherding is only about maintenance care**

Many people think shepherding ministry is only about visiting the sick, comforting the grieving, and maintaining the flock. While this is important, it's incomplete. The shepherding function in the APEST framework is about more than maintenance care. It's about developing other shepherds and creating cultures of care that multiply.

**Misunderstanding 2: Shepherding is only for pastors**

Some believe that only pastors can do shepherding ministry. However, Ephesians 4:7 says "to each one of us"—all believers are endowed with APEST gifting. While some are particularly gifted in shepherding, all believers can participate in shepherding ministry.

**Misunderstanding 3: Shepherding is only internal**

Some view shepherding as only caring for the internal community, separate from mission. However, missional shepherding means caring for the flock so it flourishes and reproduces, participating in the extension of the church's mission.

**Misunderstanding 4: Shepherding avoids conflict**

While shepherds are driven by harmony, they must beware conflict avoidance. True shepherding accepts healthy dissent and balances unity with genuine relationship. It doesn't avoid conflict but handles it in ways that build community.

### Why It Matters

Shepherding ministry matters because the church needs healthy, caring communities to flourish. Without it, churches become cold, disconnected, or focused only on mission without care. Shepherding ministry provides the relational foundation necessary for the church to function as a community.

The church's health depends on shepherding ministry. When shepherding functions well, people are cared for, communities are healthy, and cultures of care multiply. When it's absent or distorted, communities become unhealthy, people are neglected, and care doesn't multiply.

Shepherding ministry is essential for the church to fulfill its calling. It provides the relational foundation for all other ministries. Without it, the church cannot function as a healthy community.

### Biblical Foundations

**Ephesians 4:7–11** establishes shepherds (pastors) as the fourth of five essential ministries given to equip God's people.

**Jesus as Exemplary Shepherd**: Jesus is our High Priest, mediator, and the true Shepherd of Israel (2 Samuel 5:2; John 10). He heals, reconciles, and builds a new community (ecclesia), sustaining and guiding his people in love and compassion (1 Peter 2:25; Matthew 28:20).

**John 10**: Jesus as the Good Shepherd who knows his sheep, lays down his life for them, and leads them.

**1 Peter 5:1-4**: Elders called to shepherd God's flock, not lording it over them but being examples.

### Theological Framework

Shepherding ministry is rooted in the doctrine of the church as community. The church is called to be a caring, nurturing community where people are formed in Christ. Shepherding ministry ensures this happens.

Shepherding ministry is also rooted in the doctrine of formation. People need to be formed in Christ, and shepherding ministry provides the relational context for this formation to happen.

Shepherding ministry is Christological. Jesus is the exemplary shepherd, and all shepherding ministry flows from his pattern. The church is the Body of Christ, and as such, it must reflect the shepherding dimension of Jesus' ministry.

### Historical Examples

**Jesus**: The Good Shepherd who knows, cares for, and lays down his life for his sheep.

**Early Church**: Communities that cared for one another, sharing resources and supporting each other.

**Contemporary Examples**: Shepherds who build healthy communities, develop other shepherds, and create cultures of care that multiply.

#### Formation in Christ

Shepherds foster formation in Christ by building cohesive, inclusive, and stable communities. This involves creating environments where people can grow, heal, and flourish in their relationship with Christ.
