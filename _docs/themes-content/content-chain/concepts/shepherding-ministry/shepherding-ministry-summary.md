## Core Definition

Shepherding ministry is the caring, protecting, nurturing ministry that centers on nurturing healthy Christian community and caring for people's welfare. Shepherds are the church's relational foundation, fostering formation in Christ by building cohesive, inclusive, and stable communities. Effective shepherds know their community deeply—names, stories, and needs.

## Key Points

1. **Formation in Christ**: Shepherds foster formation by building cohesive, inclusive, stable communities where people grow, heal, and flourish.

2. **Knowing the Community**: Effective shepherds know their community deeply, drawing on Dunbar's Rule (relational networks cap at 120-150 people).

3. **Missional Shepherding**: Even as shepherds focus on internal health, their ministry must connect to God's broader mission, caring so the flock flourishes and reproduces.

4. **Developing Other Shepherds**: The shepherding function multiplies by developing other shepherds and creating cultures of care that multiply.

5. **Care That Multiplies**: Missional shepherding is about care that multiplies, not just maintenance care that keeps people healthy.

6. **Given to All**: Shepherding ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to pastors.

7. **Most Recognized**: Shepherding ministry is the most recognized in contemporary church, but often reduced to maintenance care.
