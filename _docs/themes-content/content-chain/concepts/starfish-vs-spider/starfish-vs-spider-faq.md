## Introduction

The Starfish vs. Spider metaphor provides a powerful framework for understanding organizational structure and leadership models in the church. This FAQ addresses common questions about the distinction between centralized (Spider) and decentralized (Starfish) organizational structures, helping leaders understand how organizational design affects multiplication, resilience, and movement dynamics. These questions emerge from engagement with church leaders exploring how to move from centralized to more distributed organizational models.

## Questions

### Q1: What exactly is the Starfish vs. Spider metaphor?

**Answer:** The Starfish vs. Spider metaphor distinguishes between two fundamentally different organizational structures. The Spider represents centralized organizations where power, decision-making, and information flow from a central head or hierarchy. If you remove that head, the organization collapses—like cutting off a spider's head kills the spider. The Starfish represents decentralized networks where power is distributed throughout the system, like a neural network. If you cut a starfish in half, it doesn't die—it regenerates into two starfish.

In the church context, Spider churches are oriented around one location, one congregation, one gathering, under one leadership head. The locus of power is centralized, flowing down like a strand of Christmas lights—if the top bulb goes out, everything below goes dark. Starfish churches are decentralized networks of multiplying disciples, leaders, and microchurches. Power is distributed like the internet, with multiple nodes and multiple directions of flow.

This distinction matters because multiplication requires decentralization. Centralized structures grow by addition; decentralized structures grow by multiplication. The early church was fundamentally Starfish-like, spreading through decentralized networks. Most contemporary Western churches are Spider-like, dependent on centralized leadership and vulnerable when key leaders fail.

### Q2: Why does the early church matter for this distinction?

**Answer:** The early church provides the pattern for how the church was designed to operate. When we examine the book of Acts and the New Testament, we see a fundamentally Starfish-like structure. The church spread through decentralized networks of multiplying disciples and communities. There was no single headquarters, no one central leader controlling everything. Power was distributed, and the movement multiplied rapidly.

"Without a doubt, the early church is a story told at the Starfish end of the continuum." The early church filled Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, then the ends of the earth—not through centralized planning but through decentralized multiplication. Disciples made disciples, communities birthed communities, and the movement spread like a network.

This matters because it shows us God's design for how the church should function. The Spider model that dominates contemporary Western Christianity represents a departure from the original design. When we recover Starfish-like structures, we align with how the church was meant to operate.

### Q3: Can churches be both Spider and Starfish?

**Answer:** Yes, churches exist on a continuum from Spider to Starfish, and hybrids are possible. The book describes two hybrid models: Spiderfish (primarily Spider with some Starfish elements) and Starder (primarily Starfish with some Spider elements). The key is understanding where power resides and how decisions are made.

A Spiderfish church might have a centralized structure but empowers decentralized expressions—the center exists to release the margins. A Starder church might have some centralized elements (like shared gatherings or resources) but maintains distributed power and multiplication patterns.

The question isn't whether to be purely one or the other, but where you are on the continuum and whether your structure supports multiplication. The goal is to move toward more Starfish-like distribution, where power is shared, leadership is multiplied, and the movement can regenerate and multiply.

### Q4: What's the difference between a multisite church and a Starfish network?

**Answer:** This is a crucial distinction. Many multisite churches are actually Spider-like structures disguised as networks. In franchise multisites (multisites that clone the original site with tight control on branding, decision making, and teaching), the locus of power is like a hub and spokes. The power flows from the hub out and down along the spokes. If the hub is removed, the network disappears.

A true Starfish network has distributed power. Each node operates with relative autonomy, making decisions locally while remaining connected to the larger network. Power and information move in multiple directions. New leaders emerge naturally. The network can regenerate even if central leaders are removed.

The test is simple: "If you thump it on the head, will it die?" If removing central leadership kills the organization, it's Spider-like. If new leaders emerge and the network continues, it's Starfish-like.

### Q5: How do we move from Spider to Starfish structures?

**Answer:** Moving from Spider to Starfish requires fundamental shifts in how power, information, and decision-making operate. It starts with redistributing power—moving from centralized control to distributed influence. This means multiplying leaders, empowering local decisions, and creating systems where information flows in multiple directions.

Key steps include: identifying and developing multiple leaders throughout the organization, creating decision-making structures that operate locally, building communication networks that flow in all directions, developing systems that support multiplication rather than control, and shifting from addition to multiplication as the growth model.

The goal is to create conditions where "good things can run wild"—where the centralized expression empowers and releases the decentralized expression, enabling multiplication and movement.

### Q6: What about accountability and quality control in Starfish structures?

**Answer:** Starfish structures require different forms of accountability and quality control than Spider structures. Instead of top-down control, Starfish organizations rely on distributed accountability, shared values, peer relationships, and collective intelligence.

Accountability happens through relationships, shared mission, and collective wisdom rather than hierarchical oversight. Quality is maintained through shared values, peer learning, and natural selection—what works multiplies, what doesn't adapts or dies. This requires trust, shared vision, and strong relational connections.

The key is developing character and competency throughout the network, not just at the top. When everyone is equipped and empowered, quality emerges from the collective rather than being enforced from above.

### Q7: Don't we need some centralization for efficiency and coordination?

**Answer:** Efficiency and coordination don't require centralization—they require good systems and communication. Starfish organizations can be highly coordinated and efficient through shared values, clear communication networks, and distributed systems.

The question is what we centralize and what we decentralize. We can centralize values, vision, and resources while decentralizing power, decisions, and multiplication. The center can serve the margins, providing support and resources while releasing people and communities to multiply.

The goal is not to eliminate all structure but to ensure structure serves multiplication rather than control. When the center exists to empower the margins, efficiency and coordination support rather than constrain multiplication.

### Q8: How does APEST relate to Starfish structures?

**Answer:** APEST (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, Teaching) is essential for Starfish structures because it distributes leadership functions throughout the body rather than concentrating them in one person. When all fivefold ministries are activated, power and function are distributed, creating natural Starfish-like patterns.

Apostolic ministry is particularly important because it multiplies and extends—the apostolic function creates new nodes in the network. When APEST functions are distributed throughout the organization rather than concentrated in leadership positions, the organization naturally becomes more Starfish-like.

The fivefold framework provides a way to distribute leadership that maintains unity while enabling multiplication. Each function serves the whole, and the whole supports each function, creating interdependence rather than dependence.

### Q9: What are examples of Starfish churches or movements?

**Answer:** Contemporary examples include: the Underground Network in Tampa (300+ microchurches), Kansas City Underground, Soma movement (hundreds of missional communities in 48 cities), Hope Chapel network (2300+ churches), and indigenous movements in India, China, and other global contexts that have multiplied rapidly through decentralized networks.

Historical examples include: the early church (Acts), Celtic missions, Moravians, Early Methodists, Early Pentecostals, Chinese house churches, and other movements that spread through decentralized multiplication rather than centralized expansion.

These movements share common characteristics: distributed leadership, local decision-making, multiplication patterns, resilient structures, and power flowing through networks rather than hierarchies.

### Q10: How do we measure success in Starfish structures?

**Answer:** Success in Starfish structures is measured differently than in Spider structures. Instead of measuring accumulation at the center (attendance, membership in one location), we measure multiplication at the margins (disciples making disciples, leaders emerging, communities reproducing).

Key metrics include: number of reproducing disciples, number of emerging leaders, number of multiplying communities, multiplication to fourth generation and beyond, gospel saturation in cities/regions, and resilience (ability to continue when central leaders are removed).

The scorecard shifts from "how many have accumulated at the center" to "how many have been sent to the margins to multiply disciples and churches."

### Q11: What about the need for teaching and theological consistency?

**Answer:** Teaching and theological consistency don't require centralization—they require shared values, good communication, and distributed equipping. Starfish organizations can maintain theological consistency through shared formation, relational accountability, peer learning, and distributed teaching.

The key is equipping people throughout the network, not just those at the top. When everyone is formed theologically and equipped to teach, consistency emerges from shared formation rather than centralized control. This requires investment in formation and equipping throughout the network.

Relational connections and peer accountability also maintain consistency. When people are connected relationally and committed to shared mission and values, they naturally maintain alignment without top-down control.

### Q12: How do finances work in Starfish structures?

**Answer:** Starfish structures use self-funding models where disciples, leaders, teams, and microchurches are responsible for sourcing and stewarding funds. The goal is to minimize resources needed at the center so the apostolic mission at the margins can be prioritized.

This doesn't mean no shared resources, but it means resources flow to support multiplication rather than maintaining central structures. The center receives resources to equip and release, not to accumulate and control. Financial models support distributed mission rather than centralized maintenance.

Many Starfish movements operate with minimal paid staff, with leaders being bi-vocational or supported by their local communities. Resources follow mission rather than maintaining structures.

### Q13: Can existing Spider churches transition to Starfish?

**Answer:** Yes, but it requires significant change. Transition involves redistributing power, multiplying leadership, creating decentralized decision-making, building communication networks, and shifting from addition to multiplication mindsets. It's a process, not an event.

Many churches start as Spiderfish—maintaining some centralization while releasing decentralized expressions. Over time, as distributed leadership develops and multiplication patterns emerge, they can move further toward Starfish structures.

The key is starting where you are and making incremental shifts that redistribute power and enable multiplication. It requires leadership willing to give away power and people willing to take responsibility for mission.

### Q14: What about the problems with centralized leadership we're seeing?

**Answer:** The problems with centralized leadership—abuse of power, burnout, single points of failure, limited multiplication—are systemic issues that emerge from Spider structures. These problems are harder to sustain in Starfish structures because power is distributed, accountability is shared, and leadership is multiplied.

Starfish structures don't eliminate all problems, but they create different dynamics. With distributed power, abuse is harder to sustain. With multiplied leadership, burnout is reduced. With resilient networks, single points of failure don't collapse the system. These structures create healthier environments for both leaders and communities.

The human cost of Spider leadership is significant—pastor burnout, abuse of power, toxic cultures. Starfish structures offer a better way that aligns with how Jesus designed leadership and how the early church operated.

### Q15: How does this relate to organic systems?

**Answer:** Starfish structures are organic systems. They grow, reproduce, and multiply like living organisms rather than machines. Organic systems are self-replicating, self-sustaining, and multiply naturally without external control.

Starfish organizations embody organic system principles: simple patterns that repeat, distributed rather than centralized control, multiplication through reproduction, adaptation and resilience, and life over control.

Organic systems are one of the six elements of mDNA, and Starfish structures enable organic multiplication. When organizations operate like Starfish, they naturally become organic systems that multiply and spread.

### Q16: What's the relationship between Starfish and multiplication?

**Answer:** Multiplication requires Starfish-like structures. Centralized (Spider) structures grow by addition—bringing people to the center, adding to existing structures. Decentralized (Starfish) structures grow by multiplication—disciples making disciples, leaders emerging, communities reproducing.

Multiplication happens when power is distributed, leadership is multiplied, and reproduction is normal. Starfish structures create these conditions. The distributed power enables reproduction. The multiplied leadership provides capacity for multiplication. The resilient networks support ongoing multiplication.

The early church multiplied because it was Starfish-like. Contemporary movements that multiply share Starfish characteristics. If we want multiplication, we need Starfish structures.

### Q17: How do we balance structure and flexibility in Starfish organizations?

**Answer:** Starfish organizations have structure, but it's flexible and adaptive. Structure serves multiplication rather than control. The structure is minimal at the center, allowing maximum flexibility at the margins. The structure supports rather than constrains.

Key principles: structure exists to serve life, not control it; minimal structure at center, robust connections throughout; structure enables multiplication rather than maintaining status quo; structure adapts as movement grows and changes.

The balance comes from having enough structure to provide support and connection while maintaining enough flexibility to allow adaptation and multiplication. Structure serves the movement, not the other way around.

### Q18: What about quality and theological soundness?

**Answer:** Quality and theological soundness in Starfish structures emerge from shared formation, relational accountability, and collective wisdom rather than centralized control. When people throughout the network are well-formed, theologically grounded, and relationally connected, quality and soundness are maintained through the collective.

This requires investment in formation and equipping throughout the network, not just at the top. It requires relational connections and peer accountability. It requires shared values and mission that guide decisions and practices.

The goal is theological maturity and missional effectiveness throughout the network, not just in leadership positions. When this is achieved, quality and soundness emerge from the collective rather than being enforced from above.

### Q19: How does communication work in Starfish structures?

**Answer:** Communication in Starfish structures flows in multiple directions, from bottom up as well as top down, directly between nodes rather than only through central channels. The greatest learning happens at the edges where discipleship and mission collide, and leaders facilitate collective intelligence by listening and reporting to the network.

This is different from Spider structures where communication flows top-down, from pastors through intermediaries, with important information processed through headquarters. In Starfish structures, communication is distributed, allowing information and learning to flow throughout the network.

This enables collective intelligence, shared learning, and rapid adaptation. When information flows freely, the network can learn, adapt, and respond quickly to opportunities and challenges.

### Q20: What's the bottom line—why does this matter?

**Answer:** This matters because multiplication and movement require Starfish-like structures. If we want to see movements that multiply and spread, we need distributed power, multiplied leadership, and resilient networks. Spider structures may be efficient for addition, but they limit multiplication and create vulnerability.

The early church was Starfish-like and multiplied rapidly. Contemporary movements that multiply share Starfish characteristics. If we want to recover the movement dynamic, we need to recover Starfish structures.

This is about aligning with how God designed the church to function. It's about creating structures that enable multiplication rather than constraining it. It's about building resilient networks that can regenerate and multiply, spreading the gospel and making disciples throughout cities and regions.

The question is: do we want addition or multiplication? Do we want control or movement? Do we want Spider efficiency or Starfish multiplication? The choice shapes our future.
