# Starfish vs. Spider: Implementation Guide

**Concept**: Starfish vs. Spider: Decentralized vs. Centralized Organizational Models  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for moving toward Starfish structures  
**Target Audience**: Church leaders, practitioners, implementers  
**Last Updated**: December 2025

---

## Overview

This guide provides practical steps for transitioning from Spider (centralized) to Starfish (decentralized) organizational structures. Moving toward Starfish structures requires redistributing power, multiplying leadership, creating decentralized decision-making, and shifting from addition to multiplication mindsets. This implementation guide walks through assessment, planning, and step-by-step transition, addressing common challenges and providing success indicators.

## Assessment

### Current State Assessment

**Questions to Consider**:

1. **Where is power located?** Is power concentrated in one person or small group, or distributed throughout the organization?

2. **What happens if key leaders are removed?** Does the organization collapse, or do new leaders emerge naturally?

3. **How do decisions get made?** Are decisions centralized at the top, or distributed throughout the organization?

4. **How does communication flow?** Is it primarily top-down, or multi-directional?

5. **How does growth happen?** Is it primarily addition (bringing people to center) or multiplication (reproducing at margins)?

6. **Where are you on the continuum?** Are you pure Spider, Spiderfish, Starder, or Starfish?

7. **What's your multiplication capacity?** Are disciples making disciples, leaders emerging, communities reproducing?

### Assessment Tools

#### Tool 1: Organizational Structure Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluates current structure and identifies areas needing change

**How to Use**: 
- Rate organization on each dimension (1=Spider, 5=Starfish)
- Areas scoring 1-2 indicate Spider characteristics needing change
- Areas scoring 4-5 indicate Starfish characteristics to strengthen

**Dimensions**:
1. Power distribution (centralized vs. distributed)
2. Leadership multiplication (single head vs. multiple leaders)
3. Decision-making (centralized vs. distributed)
4. Communication flow (top-down vs. multi-directional)
5. Growth pattern (addition vs. multiplication)
6. Resilience (vulnerable vs. resilient)
7. Flexibility (rigid vs. adaptive)

**Scoring**: 
- 7-14: Strong Spider characteristics
- 15-21: Spiderfish (hybrid leaning Spider)
- 22-28: Starder (hybrid leaning Starfish)
- 29-35: Strong Starfish characteristics

### Readiness Checklist

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Trying to Control the Process

**Description**: Maintaining centralized control over the transition process itself

**Why It Happens**: Old habits, fear of losing control, lack of trust

**How to Avoid**:
- Distribute control of transition process
- Trust the network to adapt and learn
- Let go of need to control outcomes
- Allow experimentation and failure

**If You're Already There**: Recognize the contradiction, begin redistributing control, trust the process

### Pitfall 2: Moving Too Fast

**Description**: Trying to transition too quickly without building capacity

**Why It Happens**: Impatience, urgency, wanting quick results

**How to Avoid**:
- Build capacity before redistributing power
- Develop leaders before decentralizing decisions
- Allow time for adaptation and learning
- Make incremental shifts

**If You're Already There**: Slow down, build capacity, strengthen foundation before continuing

### Pitfall 3: Not Addressing Power Issues

**Description**: Redistributing tasks but not power

**Why It Happens**: Reluctance to give away power, fear of losing control

**How to Avoid**:
- Honestly assess where power resides
- Willingly redistribute power, not just tasks
- Address power dynamics directly
- Ensure decision-making authority is distributed

**If You're Already There**: Acknowledge power issues, begin redistributing actual power, not just responsibilities

### Pitfall 4: Lack of Accountability

**Description**: Distributing power without distributed accountability

**Why It Happens**: Confusing decentralization with lack of accountability

**How to Avoid**:
- Develop distributed accountability systems
- Create peer accountability structures
- Maintain relational accountability
- Ensure shared values guide decisions

**If You're Already There**: Build accountability systems, strengthen relational connections, establish shared accountability

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Existing Strengths

**Description**: Abandoning everything that works in current structure

**Why It Happens**: All-or-nothing thinking, reaction against Spider structures

**How to Avoid**:
- Identify what's working and preserve it
- Build on existing strengths
- Transition incrementally
- Integrate rather than replace

**If You're Already There**: Identify strengths, preserve what works, build on foundation
