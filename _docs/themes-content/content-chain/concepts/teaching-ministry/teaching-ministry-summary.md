## Core Definition

Teaching ministry is the equipping, explaining, grounding ministry that mediates practical wisdom through a biblical worldview, helping people see and experience their world as God intends. Teachers focus on both broad comprehension and systematic understanding, fostering lifelong learning rather than urgency or activism.

## Key Points

1. **Mediating Wisdom**: Teaching ministry mediates practical wisdom through a biblical worldview, bringing comprehensive insight to the church's revelation.

2. **Life-Oriented**: True biblical teaching is life-oriented, ethical, and participatory. It moves beyond speculation to "ideas in action"—discipleship and formation.

3. **Integration with Practice**: Teaching must be resituated within a field of practice and with a keener concern to training in context. Mastery is bound up in reflective practitioners.

4. **Not Dominating**: Vibrant teaching is indispensable, but it must not dominate the community at the expense of other APEST functions.

5. **Teachers' Lives Reflect Message**: Teachers' lives should reflect their message. Teaching is not just about information but about formation.

6. **Given to All**: Teaching ministry is given to the entire Body of Christ, not just to trained theologians.

7. **Most Recognized**: Teaching ministry is the most recognized in contemporary church, but often dominates at expense of other ministries.
