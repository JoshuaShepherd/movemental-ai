## Overview

AI agents are conversational interfaces powered by source material, designed for on-demand answers, exploration, and personalized guidance. When source material (like a metanoia master document) is transformed into an AI agent, this guide determines exactly what elements are included, how they're structured, and how they're organized for conversational interaction.

**Response Examples**:

**Question**: "What is metanoia?"

**Response**:
> Metanoia is the fundamental transformation of mind and heart that Jesus called for in his first public words: "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" (Mark 1:15)
> 
> The Greek word *metanoia* (μετάνοια) literally means "change of mind" or "change of thinking," but in biblical usage it encompasses far more than intellectual adjustment. Metanoia involves a radical reorientation of the whole person—mind, soul, and will—toward God and his purposes.
> 
> Metanoia is a beautiful grace of God that enables us to transcend our current condition and access the mind of Christ. It's the gateway to wholehearted transformation.
> 
> Would you like to explore how metanoia works, or learn about practices for living in metanoia?
> 
> *Source: Metanoia Master Document, Chapter 1*

**Question**: "How do I practice metanoia?"

**Response**:
> Living in metanoia involves ongoing practices that open us to transformation. Here are some key practices:
> 
> 1. **Unlearning**: Identify and release obsolete paradigms and assumptions
> 2. **Relearning**: Embrace new ways of seeing and understanding
> 3. **Reflection**: Regular reflection on your journey and growth
> 4. **Community**: Engage with others on the metanoia journey
> 5. **Scripture**: Ground yourself in biblical foundations
> 
> The metanoia journey follows a U-shaped curve: descent into unlearning before ascent into relearning. This process requires patience, openness, and the work of the Holy Spirit.
> 
> Would you like to explore any of these practices in more detail, or get personalized recommendations based on your context?
