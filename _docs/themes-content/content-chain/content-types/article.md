## Overview

Articles are the foundational text-based format for communicating concepts. They serve as quick reference, deep dives, thought leadership, and SEO-optimized content. When source material (like a metanoia master document) is transformed into an article, this guide determines exactly what elements are included, how they're structured, and how they're organized.
