## Content Approach

### Voice Alignment

**Required Voice Markers** (coherence ≥0.75):
- **Christocentric Anchoring** (≥0.7): Explicit references to Jesus, Christ, gospel, Kingdom

- **Narrative Imagery** (≥0.5): Rich metaphors, concrete imagery, journey language
- **Theological Depth** (≥0.4): Biblical grounding, theological terminology (accessible)

**Voice Patterns to Use**:
- Indicative-imperative arc: State truth → Call to action
- Three-part enumeration: Lists of three elements
- Question-answer pattern: Rhetorical questions with answers
- Metaphorical definition: "X is like Y" or "Imagine X as Y"

**Voice Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Antithesis structures ("not X, but Y")
- ❌ Contrastive language ("far from", "rather than", "instead of")
- ✅ Direct affirmative statements
- ✅ Constructive, forward-moving language
