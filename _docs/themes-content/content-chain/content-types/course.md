## Content Approach

### Voice Alignment

**Required Voice Markers** (coherence ≥0.75):
- **Christocentric Anchoring** (≥0.7): Explicit references to Jesus, Christ, gospel, Kingdom
- **Prophetic Intensity** (0.5-0.8): Movement-oriented vocabulary, imperative language
- **Pastoral Warmth** (≥0.5): Relational, communal language ("we", "together")
- **Narrative Imagery** (≥0.5): Rich metaphors, concrete imagery, journey language
- **Theological Depth** (≥0.4): Biblical grounding, theological terminology (accessible)

**Voice Patterns to Use**:
- Indicative-imperative arc: State truth → Call to action
- Three-part enumeration: Lists of three elements
- Question-answer pattern: Rhetorical questions with answers
- Metaphorical definition: "X is like Y" or "Imagine X as Y"

**Voice Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Antithesis structures ("not X, but Y")
- ❌ Contrastive language ("far from", "rather than", "instead of")
- ✅ Direct affirmative statements
- ✅ Constructive, forward-moving language

### Content Depth

**Course Types by Duration**:

1. **Short Course** (2-4 weeks, 5-10 hours)
   - Focused on single concept
   - 3-5 modules
   - 6-12 lessons
   - Best for: Introduction to concept

2. **Standard Course** (6-12 weeks, 15-30 hours)
   - Comprehensive treatment
   - 5-8 modules
   - 12-24 lessons
   - Best for: Deep dive into concept

3. **Extended Course** (12-26 weeks, 30-60 hours)
   - Transformation journey
   - 8-12 modules
   - 24-40 lessons
   - Best for: Comprehensive transformation

### Content Sources

**Primary Source Material**:
- Master documents (comprehensive source)
- Implementation guides (practical focus)
- FAQ documents (question-focused)
- Multiple related concepts (for series)

**Transformation Strategy**:
1. Identify learning objectives from source material
2. Structure content into modules (logical progression)
3. Break modules into lessons (digestible chunks)
4. Add interactive elements (cohort sessions, field experiments)
5. Create assessments (quizzes, reflections, evaluations)
6. Develop resources (readings, tools, templates)

### Content Organization

**Module Progression**:
- **Foundation**: Introduction and basics
- **Development**: Core concepts and principles
- **Application**: Practical implementation
- **Integration**: Synthesis and advanced topics
- **Transformation**: Personal journey and practice

**Lesson Progression**:
- **Introduction**: Hook and overview
- **Development**: Core content
- **Application**: Examples and practice
- **Reflection**: Personal engagement
- **Summary**: Key points and next steps

**Content Flow**:
- **Linear**: Sequential progression (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3)
- **Progressive**: Building complexity (Simple → Complex)
- **Spiral**: Revisiting concepts at deeper levels

```
Module 1: Foundation (Understanding)
Module 2: Development (Principles)
Module 3: Application (Practice)
Module 4: Integration (Synthesis)
Module 5: Transformation (Journey)
```

**Pattern 2: Concept → Practice → Integration**
```
Module 1: What is X? (Definition)
Module 2: Why Does X Matter? (Significance)
Module 3: How Does X Work? (Mechanism)
Module 4: How to Apply X (Practice)
Module 5: Living in X (Integration)
```

**Pattern 3: Assessment → Personalized Pathways**
```
Module 0: Assessment and Orientation
Module 1-X: Personalized modules based on assessment
Module Final: Integration and Certification
```

### Course Series

**Series Structure**:
- **Theme**: Common theme connecting courses
- **Number**: 3-7 courses per series
- **Progression**: Logical progression through theme
- **Prerequisites**: Some courses may require others

**Example Series for Metanoia**:

2. "Metanoia: Personal Transformation" (Individual focus)
3. "Metanoia: Collective Transformation" (Organizational focus)
4. "Metanoia: The Journey" (Process and practice)

### Course Delivery Formats
