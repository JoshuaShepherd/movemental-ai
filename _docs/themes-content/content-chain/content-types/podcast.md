## Content Approach

### Voice Alignment

**Required Voice Markers** (coherence ≥0.75):
- **Christocentric Anchoring** (≥0.7): Explicit references to Jesus, Christ, gospel, Kingdom
- **Prophetic Intensity** (0.5-0.8): Movement-oriented vocabulary, imperative language
- **Pastoral Warmth** (≥0.5): Relational, communal language ("we", "together")
- **Narrative Imagery** (≥0.5): Rich metaphors, concrete imagery, journey language

**Voice Adaptation for Podcast**:
- **Written to Spoken**: Adapt written voice to conversational tone
- **Natural Flow**: Allow for tangents and exploration

**Voice Patterns to Use**:
- Indicative-imperative arc: State truth → Call to action
- Three-part enumeration: Lists of three elements
- Question-answer pattern: Rhetorical questions with answers
- Metaphorical definition: "X is like Y" or "Imagine X as Y"

**Voice Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Antithesis structures ("not X, but Y")
