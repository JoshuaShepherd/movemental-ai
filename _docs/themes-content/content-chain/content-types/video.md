## Content Approach

### Voice Alignment

**Required Voice Markers** (coherence ≥0.75):
- **Christocentric Anchoring** (≥0.7): Explicit references to Jesus, Christ, gospel, Kingdom
- **Prophetic Intensity** (0.5-0.8): Movement-oriented vocabulary, imperative language

**Voice Patterns to Use**:
- Indicative-imperative arc: State truth → Call to action
- Three-part enumeration: Lists of three elements

**Voice Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Antithesis structures ("not X, but Y")
