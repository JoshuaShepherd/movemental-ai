# Chapter 1: Introduction—This Moment, This DNA

> "For from him and through him and for him are all things."  
> —Romans 11:36

## Anchor Scripture: Romans 11:36

**Reading Practice: Lectio Divina**

Before we dive into the content of this chapter, I want to invite you to spend a few minutes with this verse from Romans 11. It's a simple sentence, really. Just ten words in English. But it contains everything.

Take a moment. Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*For from him and through him and for him are all things.*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the first phrase: "from him." What does it mean that all things come *from* him? What is the source? What is the origin?

Read it a third time, focusing on "through him." What does it mean that all things come *through* him? What is the means? What is the pathway?

Read it one more time, focusing on "for him." What does it mean that all things are *for* him? What is the purpose? What is the end?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just movement DNA, not just church strategy, not just organizational theory. We're exploring what it means that everything—everything—comes from him, through him, and for him. And if that's true, then what does it mean for the church? What does it mean for movement? What does it mean for you?

## This Moment

This is a moment. I want to start there, because I think it matters.

It's a moment in the world when everything seems to be shifting. When old certainties are crumbling. When the church finds itself in a new kind of exile—not from buildings or programs necessarily, but from the cultural center it once occupied. We're not being persecuted in the way the early church was, or the Chinese underground church was. But we're being marginalized. We're being ignored. We're being dismissed as irrelevant, outdated, out of touch.

And this is also a moment for me. A personal moment. A moment when, for the first time in my decades of writing and speaking, I'm making my content available online, in new forms, in ways that might reach people I've never met, in contexts I've never imagined.

I'll be honest with you: people often tell me my work is hard to understand. Or hard to know what to do with. I get that. I've spent decades wrestling with complex systems, theological frameworks, movement dynamics. I've written books that assume you've read other books, that build on concepts introduced elsewhere, that speak to people already deep in the missional conversation.

But here's what I'm realizing: maybe this moment—this moment of new forms, new platforms, new ways of connecting—is exactly when we need to go back to the beginning. Not to simplify what's complex, but to remember what's essential. Not to dumb things down, but to recover what's been forgotten.

Because the truth is, movement DNA isn't actually complicated. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of institutional thinking. But it's there. It's in every believer. It's in every expression of church. It's latent, waiting to be reactivated.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment of cultural shift, this moment of new forms, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to rediscover it.

## The Question That Haunts

Let me ask you a question. It's the question that has haunted me for decades, the question that launched my own quest to understand movement.

How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in just two centuries?

Think about that. In AD 100, there were maybe 25,000 Christians. By AD 310, when Constantine came on the scene, there were up to 20 million. That's exponential growth. That's multiplication, not addition. That's movement.

But here's what makes it even more remarkable: they had none of the things we assume are necessary for church growth.

They were members of an illegal religion throughout this period. At best, they were tolerated. At worst, they were severely persecuted.

They didn't have church buildings as we know them. While archaeologists have discovered "chapels" from this period, they were mostly converted houses.

They didn't even have the Scriptures as we now have them. They were putting the canon together during this period.

They didn't have a formal institution or the professional type of leadership normally associated with it. At times of relative calm, prototypical forms of leadership emerged, but these were at best pre-institutional.

They didn't have seeker-sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands, seminaries, commentaries, and so on—all the things we assume we need to solve the problems of the church.

They actually made it hard to join the church. By the late second century, aspiring converts had to undergo a significant initiation period to prove they were worthy of joining the community of the baptized.

In fact, these Christians had none of the things we would ordinarily employ to solve the problems of the church, yet they grew from as few as 25,000 to as many as 20 million in two centuries.

How did they do it?

Before you dismiss the example of the early Christian movement as being too ancient or too different from our context, consider this: we can observe a similar phenomenon in our own time. When Western observers were finally allowed back into China in the early 1980s, after decades of the most severe persecution under Mao Tse-tung, they expected to find the church decimated. Instead, they discovered that Christianity had flourished beyond all imagination. The church in China, which had numbered around 2 million when the communists took power, had grown to an estimated 80 million or more—some estimates now put it at 120 million or higher.

And remember, not unlike the early church, these people had no buildings, no professional clergy, no central organization, and no mass meetings, yet their numbers grew like wildfire.

We can observe similar growth patterns in other historical movements. In John Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women had become Methodists. In Wales, the revival movement claimed the allegiance of 34 percent of the population. The Pentecostal movement, which began in the early 1900s with a handful of people, now numbers an estimated half a billion people worldwide and will likely have one billion adherents by mid-century.

How did they do it?

This is the question that has driven my work for decades. This is the question I want to explore with you. Not as an academic exercise, not as historical curiosity, but as a living reality that might just change everything about how we understand the church and its mission.

## The Answer: Movement DNA

After years of studying these movements—the early church, the Chinese underground church, the Methodists, the Pentecostals, and others—I've become convinced that they all share something in common. Not a program. Not a strategy. Not a model we can copy.

They share what I call **movement DNA**—or **mDNA** for short.

Movement DNA consists of six essential elements that, when working together, generate what I call **Apostolic Genius**—that mysterious, powerful, movemental energy that transforms communities into world-changing movements.

But here's the crucial thing, and I want you to hear this clearly: **mDNA isn't something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate.**

It's already there. It's in every believer. It's in every expression of church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of institutional thinking, consumer patterns, attractional models. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

Think of it like this: In the same way that DNA is found in every cell of your body, containing all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism, so mDNA is found in every genuine expression of the church. It contains all the information needed for the church to be what it's designed to be—a movement, not just an institution.

The DNA metaphor is intentional. Like biological DNA:
- It's found in every living cell (present in every genuine expression of church)
- It contains all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism
- It's self-replicating (can be passed from one generation to the next)
- It carries vital information for healthy reproduction
- It can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated

This is why I call this book a primer. Or maybe a re-primer. Because we're not learning something new. We're remembering something old. We're rediscovering what we've forgotten. We're reactivating what's been suppressed.

## The Six Elements

Let me give you a quick overview of the six elements we'll be exploring together. Don't worry if they don't all make sense yet. We'll dive deep into each one in the chapters ahead. But I want you to see the whole picture from the start, because mDNA is systemic. The elements don't work in isolation. They work together, creating something greater than the sum of their parts.

**1. Jesus Is Lord** — This is not just one element among six. This is the foundation. The center. The heart. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems. What remains is this: Jesus is Lord. This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority and demands total allegiance. Everything else flows from here.

**2. Disciple-Making** — Jesus didn't write books or build buildings. He made disciples. The selection and development of followers was his foundational strategy. Disciple-making is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move. It is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making.

**3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse** — This represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). We go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. We become native to our context rather than remaining foreign. We engage in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

**4. APEST Culture** — This refers to the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds, and Teachers. But it's not just about roles—it's about forms of intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher. This truncation creates stasis and prevents movement.

**5. Organic Systems** — Movements require a different kind of structure than institutions. They need organic systems—living, breathing, reproducing structures that enable multiplication rather than constrain it. Like a starfish (cut it in half and you get two starfish) rather than a spider (cut off its head and it dies). Organic systems are reproducible, distributed, adaptive, simple, and fractal.

**6. Communitas** — This is not just community. It's liminal community—community forged in the liminal space between the old and the new, in shared adventure and risk, in the experience of being "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers. Communitas emerges when people are in liminal space, facing shared challenges, committed to a common mission, dependent on each other.

These six elements, when working together, generate Apostolic Genius. Not the sum of the parts, but something greater—an emergent property that appears when the system activates.

But here's what I want you to see: each element connects back to the center. Jesus is Lord gives meaning and coherence to everything else. Disciple-making flows from Jesus' lordship. Mission flows from Jesus' lordship. APEST flows from Jesus' lordship. Organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom Jesus announced. Communitas reflects the nature of the community Jesus created.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. This is the theological logic that undergirds everything.

## Who This Is For

Maybe you're new to these ideas. Maybe you've heard about mDNA or Apostolic Genius but need a clear, accessible introduction. Maybe you're wrestling with the gap between what the church is and what it could be, and you're looking for answers.

Or maybe you're coming back to these ideas for what I call **metanoia**—that deep rethinking, that remembering, that recognition that you've been thinking about things the wrong way. Maybe you've been operating in institutional modes, and you're realizing something's missing. Maybe you've been trying to engineer movement through programs and strategies, and you're discovering it doesn't work that way.

This book is for both of you. For the beginner and for the one in metanoia. For the one who's discovering and for the one who's remembering.

Because here's the thing: whether you're learning this for the first time or coming back to it for the hundredth time, the invitation is the same. Remember what you've forgotten. Reactivate what's been suppressed. Rediscover the movement DNA that's already within you, already within your community, already encoded in the very nature of the church.

## What to Expect

In the chapters ahead, we're going to explore each of these six elements in depth. But we're going to do it in a particular way.

Each chapter will include:
- **Anchor Scripture** — A biblical text that grounds the chapter theologically, with a practice for engaging it contemplatively
- **Reading** — The main chapter content, written to be accessible but not shallow, theological but not academic
- **Agentic Conversation** — An interactive, AI-facilitated conversation that helps you find a core action arising from how that week's content intersects with where you are
- **Reflection** — Structured questions and journaling prompts to help you process and integrate what you're learning

And throughout it all, we'll keep coming back to the center: **Jesus is Lord**. Not as one element among six, but as the foundation that gives meaning and coherence to everything else.

We'll also maintain awareness of the whole system. While we explore each element, we'll remember that they work together. You can't have movement with just one or two elements. You need all six, working together, creating Apostolic Genius.

## The Journey Ahead

This is not going to be easy. I should tell you that upfront.

Reactivating movement DNA isn't easy. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of institutional thinking, consumer patterns, attractional models. It requires courage, risk, adventure.

But I'll also tell you this: the future lies in the womb of the present. The seed is already there. The DNA is already encoded. The potential for movement already exists. We don't need to create something new. We need to remember what we've forgotten. We need to reactivate what's been suppressed.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment of cultural shift, this moment of new forms, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to do that.

So here's my invitation to you: Come with me on this journey. Whether you're new to these ideas or coming back for metanoia, whether you're discovering or remembering, whether you're a beginner or someone who's been wrestling with these questions for years.

Come and rediscover the movement DNA that's already within you, already within your community, already encoded in the very nature of the church.

Come and remember what we've forgotten.

Come and reactivate what's been suppressed.

Come and participate in what God is already doing.

The journey begins here. The journey begins now.

And it all starts—and ends—with this: **For from him and through him and for him are all things.**

Everything flows from him. Everything comes through him. Everything is for him.

Even movement. Especially movement.

## Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you are in your journey and what questions you're bringing.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify where they are in their journey—new discovery or metanoia moment? What questions are they bringing? What movement DNA might already be active (or suppressed) in their context?

**Sample Prompts:**
- What brought you to this moment? What questions are you carrying?
- Are you discovering these ideas for the first time, or are you coming back to them for metanoia—deep rethinking and remembering?
- Where do you see movement DNA already active in your context? Where is it suppressed?
- What would it mean for you to "remember" rather than "learn" movement DNA?

## Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **What brought you to this moment?** What questions are you carrying? What's driving your interest in movement DNA?

2. **Where are you in your journey?** Are you discovering these ideas for the first time, or are you coming back to them for metanoia—that deep rethinking and remembering? What does that mean for how you approach this material?

3. **Where do you see movement DNA already active in your context?** What elements are present? What's working? What gives you hope?

4. **Where is movement DNA suppressed in your context?** What elements are missing? What obstacles stand in the way? What needs to be reactivated?

5. **What would it mean for you to "remember" rather than "learn" movement DNA?** How would that shift your approach? What would change?

6. **How does Romans 11:36—"For from him and through him and for him are all things"—speak to you right now?** What does it mean that everything comes from him, through him, and for him? How does that connect to movement?

7. **What's your next step?** What do you need to do to engage this journey fully? What support do you need? What questions do you want to explore further?

## Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to dive deep into the foundation: **Jesus Is Lord**. This is not just one element among six. This is the heart of it all. The center from which everything else flows.

When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems. What remains is this: Jesus is Lord.

We'll explore how this confession represents the core of biblical monotheism, how it eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority, how it demands total allegiance, and how it gives meaning and coherence to all the other elements of movement DNA.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: this is not about adding something new. This is about remembering what we've forgotten. This is about reactivating what's been suppressed.

The DNA is already there. The seed is already planted. The potential is already present.

We just need to remember. We just need to reactivate. We just need to participate in what God is already doing.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from him, through him, and for him.

Everything. Always. Forever.
