# Chapter 4: Missional-Incarnational Impulse—Going Out and Going Deep

> "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."

## Anchor Scripture: The Sending

**Reading Practice: Reflective Reading**

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's short. Just eight words in English. But it contains everything we need to understand about mission.

Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the first phrase: "As the Father has sent me." How did the Father send Jesus? What did that look like? What did that mean?

Read it a third time, focusing on the second phrase: "I am sending you." What does it mean that Jesus is sending us? How are we sent? Where are we sent? What are we sent to do?

Now read it one more time, focusing on the connection: "As... so." Jesus is saying that our sending is like his sending. Our mission is like his mission. Our way is like his way.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. This is not just a command. This is an invitation. This is a commissioning. This is the pattern for how we engage the world.

If you want to go deeper, read Matthew 28:18-20 alongside this. Notice how the Great Commission flows from Jesus' authority and leads to disciple-making. Notice how mission and discipleship are connected. Notice how we're sent to make disciples, not just to make converts.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just mission strategy. Not just evangelism techniques. Not just church growth methods. We're exploring what it means to be sent as Jesus was sent. We're exploring what it means to go out and go deep. We're exploring what it means to become native to our context rather than remaining foreign.

## Two Movements, One Reality

Let me ask you a question: How do you engage the world?

I know, that's a big question. But I want you to think about it. When you think about mission, when you think about evangelism, when you think about reaching people with the gospel, what comes to mind?

For many of us, mission means inviting people to come to us. It means creating better programs, better services, better experiences that will attract people to our churches. It means making our churches more appealing, more relevant, more welcoming so that people will want to join us.

But here's what I want you to see: that's not mission. That's attraction. And there's a world of difference between the two.

Mission is not about getting people to come to us. Mission is about going to people. Mission is not about creating attractive programs. Mission is about becoming native to our context. Mission is not about making our churches more appealing. Mission is about embodying the gospel in the places where people already live and work and play.

This is what I call the **missional-incarnational impulse**. It represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities. They're not two different strategies. They're two dimensions of the same reality, like scissor blades that work together, like two wings that enable flight.

You can't have one without the other. You can't go out without going deep. You can't go deep without going out. They work together. They need each other. They create something together that neither can create alone.

And here's what's crucial: this impulse is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of attractional thinking. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

## The Missional Impulse: Going Out

Let's start with the missional impulse—the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church.

I want to be clear about something from the start: mission is not merely an activity of the church. Mission is the result of God's initiative. Mission flows from who God is and what God is doing in the world. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people.

This is what theologians call the **missio Dei**—the mission of God. Over the past fifty years, there has been a massive shift in missiology from a church-centered understanding of mission to a God-centered one. Mission is not something the church does for God. Mission is something God does, and the church participates in it.

Think about it. God's mission began with the call of Abraham. It unfolded in the history of God's people. It reached its climax in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. And it continues today in the church's participation in God's ongoing work to restore and heal creation.

As Darrell Guder notes, "We have learned to speak of God as a 'missionary God.'" Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" (John 20:21). The church exists as a missionary people, sent by God into the world.

This "sending" is not optional. It's not something we choose to do. It's who we are. It's our identity. It's our nature. The church is missionary by its very essence, or it's not the church.

The missional impulse can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts. It's the sneeze that cannot be suppressed, the outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission. When this impulse is blocked—when churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches—they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact.

Here's what I mean by "going out": we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. This is a fundamental shift in orientation. Instead of building better programs to attract people, we go out into the world where people already are. Instead of creating special events that people might attend, we engage in the ordinary places of life. Instead of expecting people to cross cultural barriers to reach us, we cross cultural barriers to reach them.

This is what Jesus did. He didn't wait for people to come to him. He went to them. He went to the tax collectors and sinners. He went to the lepers and the outcasts. He went to the Samaritans and the Gentiles. He went into the marketplace, into the homes, into the places where people lived and worked and played.

And this is what the early church did. They didn't build buildings and wait for people to come. They went out into the world. They went into the synagogues, into the marketplaces, into the homes. They went to where people were, and they engaged them there.

This is what every significant movement in history has done. The Methodists went out into the fields and the factories. The Pentecostals went out into the streets and the neighborhoods. The Chinese underground church went out into the villages and the cities, meeting people where they were.

When movements lose this outward impulse, when they rely exclusively on attractional approaches, they decline. They become insular. They become irrelevant. They lose their transformative power.

But when movements maintain this outward impulse, when they go to people rather than expecting people to come to them, they multiply. They spread. They transform. They become movements.

## The Incarnational Impulse: Going Deep

But going out is only half the story. The missional impulse must be matched by the incarnational impulse—the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts.

Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

Think about what the incarnation means. When God came into our world in and through Jesus, the Eternal moved into the neighborhood and took up residence among us (John 1:14). The central thrust of the incarnation is that by becoming one of us, God was able to achieve redemption for the human race and radical identification with all that it means to be human.

Jesus didn't just appear as a divine being in human disguise. He became fully human. He experienced hunger and thirst, joy and sorrow, friendship and betrayal, life and death. He learned a language. He grew up in a culture. He understood the customs and practices of his people. He became native to his context.

And here's what's crucial: the incarnation not only qualifies God's acts in the world but must also qualify ours. If God's central way of reaching his world was to incarnate himself in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be incarnational.

As David Bosch writes, "The Word has to become flesh in every new context." To act incarnationally, we will need to exercise a genuine identification and affinity with those we are trying to reach. We must become native to our context rather than remaining foreign.

This is what I mean by "going deep": we become fully present in the culture we're called to reach. We learn the language. We understand the customs. We appreciate the rhythms. We engage authentically. We become part of the community, not just observers of it.

This is what the early church did. When they went into new contexts, they didn't impose their own culture. They became native to each context. They learned the languages. They understood the customs. They adapted their methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

This is what the Celtic monks did. They practiced peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They left their homeland to engage in dangerous mission, becoming native to new cultures while maintaining their core identity. They took culture seriously, adapting their methods to each context while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

This is what the Moravians did. They sent out more missionaries in the first twenty years of their movement than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years. And they were characterized by incarnational mission—deep identification with the cultures they served, which enabled them to have transformative impact.

When churches remain foreign to their contexts, when they impose their own culture rather than becoming native, they lose their transformative power. They become irrelevant. They become obstacles to the gospel rather than channels for it.

But when churches become native to their contexts, when they go deep into culture, when they embody the gospel in ways that make sense to each context, they enable the gospel to take root and flourish. They become movements.

## The Six Practices of Incarnation

But how do we actually do this? How do we go deep? How do we become native to our context?

I want to introduce you to what I call the six practices of incarnational mission. These are not steps in a process. They're not a formula to follow. They're practices to cultivate, habits to develop, ways of being that enable authentic engagement with culture.

**1. Presence** — Full identification with culture. This means being fully present in the spaces where people live and work, not as an outsider trying to extract people, but as a neighbor participating in community life. Presence means showing up, being there, being available, being present in the ordinary moments of life.

Think about Jesus. He was fully present. He didn't just visit. He dwelt. He didn't just observe. He participated. He didn't just teach. He lived. He was fully present in the culture of first-century Palestine, and his presence transformed everything.

**2. Proximity** — Geographic and relational closeness. This means moving into neighborhoods, frequenting third places (cafés, pubs, parks), being where people are. Proximity means physical closeness, but it also means relational closeness—building relationships over time, not just quick encounters.

Think about the early church. They didn't just visit neighborhoods. They moved into them. They lived there. They became neighbors. They built relationships. They created proximity, and proximity enabled transformation.

**3. Powerlessness** — Humility and vulnerability. This means approaching with humility rather than trying to control or fix. Powerlessness means letting go of our need to be in charge, our need to have the answers, our need to be the experts. It means entering as learners, not teachers; as servants, not masters.

Think about Jesus. He didn't come with power and might. He came as a servant. He came in weakness. He came in vulnerability. He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant (Philippians 2:7). And this powerlessness was not weakness—it was strength. It enabled authentic engagement.

**4. Prevenience** — Recognizing God's work already present. This means seeing where God is already at work and joining with him, rather than trying to start something new. Prevenience means recognizing that God was there before we arrived, that God is already active, that our role is to join what God is doing.

Think about Paul in Athens. He didn't start from scratch. He recognized that God was already at work. He saw the altar to the unknown god, and he used it as a bridge to the gospel (Acts 17:23). He recognized prevenience, and it enabled authentic engagement.

**5. Passion** — Embracing redemptive suffering. This means being willing to enter into pain and brokenness, to feel the pain of the people, to suffer with them. Passion means not avoiding the hard places, not protecting ourselves from the cost, but embracing it as part of the mission.

Think about Jesus. He didn't avoid suffering. He embraced it. He entered into the pain and brokenness of the world. He wept over Jerusalem. He felt the pain of the people. He suffered with them, and through that suffering, redemption came.

**6. Proclamation** — Sharing the good news. This means speaking the gospel in ways that make sense to each context, not just repeating formulas, but engaging with the real questions and concerns of people. Proclamation means both word and deed, both speaking and embodying, both telling and showing.

Think about the early church. They didn't just live good lives. They proclaimed the good news. They spoke about Jesus. They told the story. They shared the message. But they did it in ways that made sense to each context, adapting their methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

These six practices work together. You can't have one without the others. They're not a checklist. They're a way of being. They're practices to cultivate, habits to develop, ways of engaging that enable authentic incarnation.

## The Scissors That Cut

Let me use an image that might help you see how these two impulses work together.

Think of a pair of scissors. You have two blades. Each blade is important. Each blade is necessary. But neither blade can cut by itself. It's only when the two blades work together that they can cut.

The missional impulse is one blade. The incarnational impulse is the other blade. They work together. They need each other. They create something together that neither can create alone.

If you only have the missional impulse—if you only go out—you might reach people, but you won't go deep. You'll remain foreign to your context. You'll impose your own culture. You'll miss the nuances, the subtleties, the ways that the gospel needs to be embodied in each specific context.

If you only have the incarnational impulse—if you only go deep—you might become native to your context, but you won't go out. You'll stay in your comfort zone. You'll engage only with people like you. You'll miss the call to reach beyond your boundaries, to cross cultural barriers, to engage with those who are different.

But when you have both—when you go out and go deep—you create something powerful. You become a movement. You enable the gospel to take root and flourish in every context. You become like Jesus—sent, incarnate, present.

This is what movements do. They go out. They go deep. They work together. They create something that neither can create alone.

## The Attractional Alternative

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained in what I call the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern. This is the default mode of most Western churches. It's what we know. It's what we're comfortable with. It's what we've been taught.

The attractional approach says: "Come to us. Join us. Be like us." It focuses on creating better programs, better services, better experiences that will attract people to our churches. It expects people to cross cultural barriers to reach us. It assumes that if we build it, they will come.

And here's the thing: the attractional approach works—up to a point. It works in contexts where people are already open to church, where they're already looking for spiritual community, where they're already willing to cross cultural barriers. It works in what I call m0-m1 contexts—contexts where there's already some openness to the gospel.

But the attractional approach has limits. It can't reach beyond significant cultural barriers. It can't engage with people who aren't looking for church. It can't connect with those who see the church as foreign, irrelevant, or even hostile.

When churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches, they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact. They become insular. They become irrelevant. They lose their transformative power.

The missional-incarnational impulse, on the other hand, can reach beyond significant cultural barriers. It can engage with people who aren't looking for church. It can connect with those who see the church as foreign, irrelevant, or even hostile. It can become native to any context while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

This is why movements that maintain the missional-incarnational impulse thrive, while movements that lose it decline. This impulse is not optional. It's essential. It's encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

## Church Follows Mission

Here's another crucial insight: **church follows mission, not the other way around.**

Most of us have been trained to think that mission is something the church does. We build the church first, and then we do mission. We create the structure, and then we engage. We establish the institution, and then we reach out.

But that's backwards. In authentic movements, mission comes first. Church follows mission. The church is formed out of mission, not the other way around.

Think about the early church. They didn't start with a church structure. They started with mission. They went out. They engaged. They made disciples. And as they did, the church emerged. The church was formed out of mission.

Think about the Chinese underground church. They didn't start with buildings or programs. They started with mission. They went out. They engaged. They made disciples. And as they did, the church emerged. The church was formed out of mission.

Think about the Methodists. They didn't start with a denomination. They started with mission. They went out. They engaged. They made disciples. And as they did, the church emerged. The church was formed out of mission.

This is the pattern: mission first, church second. When we begin with incarnational mission, the church will explore its way of life and corporate expression within each cultural context. The church will be formed out of mission and missional action specific to its context.

Worship style, social dynamics, liturgical expressions—all of these must result from the process of contextualizing the gospel in any given context. The church is a dynamic expression of the people of God in any given place, and it must be formed out of mission, not imposed on mission.

When we reverse this order—when we start with church and then do mission—we end up with churches that are foreign to their contexts, that impose their own culture, that remain irrelevant. But when we start with mission—when we go out and go deep—the church emerges naturally, organically, authentically.

## The Nooks and Crannies

Let me ask you another question: Where does mission happen?

For many of us, mission happens in special places at special times. It happens in church buildings on Sunday mornings. It happens in evangelistic events. It happens in mission trips to faraway places.

But here's what I want you to see: mission happens in the "nooks and crannies" of society. It happens in the ordinary places of life. It happens where people already live and work and play. It happens in the marketplace, in the neighborhood, in the café, in the workplace, in the school, in the home.

This is what I mean by "nooks and crannies." These are the spaces where people gather, where relationships form, where life happens. These are the spaces that are often overlooked by the church, but they're exactly where mission needs to happen.

Think about Jesus. He didn't just engage in the synagogue. He engaged in the marketplace, in the homes, in the fields, in the streets. He went to where people were. He engaged in the nooks and crannies of first-century Palestine.

Think about the early church. They didn't just meet in special buildings. They met in homes, in marketplaces, in public spaces. They engaged in the nooks and crannies of the Roman Empire.

Think about the Methodists. They didn't just engage in churches. They engaged in the fields, in the factories, in the coal mines. They went to where people were. They engaged in the nooks and crannies of industrial England.

This is where mission happens. Not in special places at special times, but in the ordinary places of ordinary life. Not in programs we create, but in the spaces where people already gather. Not in events we plan, but in the relationships that form naturally.

When we engage in the nooks and crannies, we become good news in flesh and blood as well as word. We embody the gospel. We live it out. We become the message, not just messengers.

---

## Proximity, Frequency, Spontaneity

But how do we actually engage in the nooks and crannies? How do we go out and go deep?

I want to introduce you to three practices that enable the missional impulse: **proximity, frequency, and spontaneity**.

**Proximity** means being physically close to the people we're called to reach. This might mean moving into a neighborhood, frequenting a third place (a café, a pub, a park), or being where people already are. Proximity creates opportunity. It enables relationships. It makes engagement possible.

Think about it. You can't build relationships with people you never see. You can't engage with people who aren't there. Proximity creates the conditions for relationship, for engagement, for mission.

**Frequency** means being there regularly, not just occasionally. This means developing rhythms of engagement, not just one-time events. Frequency builds trust. It creates familiarity. It enables deep relationships to form.

Think about it. One-time encounters don't build relationships. Occasional visits don't create trust. But regular presence does. Frequency enables the kind of relationships that make mission possible.

**Spontaneity** means creating space for unplanned connections, not just scheduled events. This means being flexible, being available, being open to the unexpected. Spontaneity enables authentic engagement. It creates space for the Holy Spirit to work. It allows relationships to develop naturally.

Think about it. Scheduled events are important, but they're not enough. We need space for spontaneous connections, for unplanned conversations, for unexpected opportunities. Spontaneity enables the kind of engagement that makes mission authentic.

These three practices work together. Proximity creates opportunity. Frequency builds trust. Spontaneity enables authenticity. They're not a formula. They're practices to cultivate, habits to develop, ways of being that enable the missional impulse.

## Romancing the City

Let me use another image that might help you understand what it means to go deep.

I call it "romancing the city." This is the practice of developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. It's courtship rather than speed dating. It's patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work.

Think about courtship. When you're courting someone, you don't rush. You take time. You pay attention. You listen. You learn. You appreciate. You develop deep understanding. You build relationship.

This is what it means to romance the city. We don't rush in with our agenda. We take time. We pay attention. We listen. We learn. We appreciate. We develop deep understanding. We build relationship.

This involves what I call the art of paying attention. Like Moses at the burning bush, we need to learn to notice where God is already at work. We need to pay attention to the culture, to the people, to the context. We need to see what others miss.

This also involves the art of listening. We need to learn what "good news" means to each context. We need to understand the questions people are asking, the concerns they're carrying, the hopes they're holding. We need to listen before we speak.

And this involves what I call "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy. We need to feel what others feel, to understand their experience, to enter into their world. We need to develop the kind of empathy that enables authentic engagement.

Romancing the city is not about manipulation. It's not about getting people to join our church. It's about developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. It's about becoming native to our context. It's about embodying the gospel in ways that make sense to each context.

When we romance the city, we enable the gospel to take root and flourish. We become movements. We transform communities. We participate in what God is already doing.

## The Challenge of Contextualization

But here's a question that often comes up: How far do we go in contextualization? How far is too far?

This is a legitimate question. We don't want to compromise the gospel. We don't want to blend it with other religions or ideologies. We don't want to lose our core identity.

But here's what I want you to see: the question is not whether we contextualize. We all contextualize. The question is whether we do it well or poorly, whether we do it consciously or unconsciously, whether we do it in ways that maintain fidelity to the gospel or in ways that compromise it.

The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, since every generation has its own unique questions. The church must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. This requires understanding the culture, learning its language, appreciating its rhythms, and adapting methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

But how do we know when contextualization becomes syncretism? How do we know when we've gone too far?

I believe that the concept of "Jesus is Lord" provides the answer. If we maintain the lordship of Jesus and his exclusive claim over all aspects of our lives, then we have a clear standard by which to judge the difference between syncretism and genuinely incarnational expressions of church.

Syncretism is a religion that merely diminishes the tension of living under the claim of Jesus. It's when we compromise the gospel to make it more palatable, when we blend it with other authorities, when we set aside Jesus' claims in certain areas of life.

But genuinely incarnational expressions of church maintain the lordship of Jesus while becoming native to the context. They adapt methods while maintaining fidelity to the message. They become culturally relevant while remaining theologically faithful.

The key is to always ask: Does this align with the nature and character of Jesus? How far from this ideal is too far? I suggest that it is when we can no longer see Jesus in what we're doing—that simple.

When we maintain Jesus' lordship as the center, we can contextualize boldly while remaining faithful. We can become native to our context while maintaining our core identity. We can engage authentically while preserving the gospel.

---

## Connecting Back to Jesus' Lordship

But here's what I want you to see: the missional-incarnational impulse flows from recognizing that Jesus is Lord. If Jesus is Lord, then we follow him into the world. We go where he went. We do what he did. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present.

This is the connection between "Jesus is Lord" and mission. When Jesus is Lord, we follow him. We go where he went. We engage as he engaged. We become like him.

This is also the connection between disciple-making and mission. When we make disciples, we're making people who follow Jesus. And following Jesus means going where he went, doing what he did, becoming like him—sent, incarnate, present.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we go out. We go deep. We become native to our context. We engage in the nooks and crannies. We practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

This is the theological logic. This is the missional logic. This is the movement logic.

---

## The Pattern of Movements

Let me show you how this pattern works in movements throughout history.

The early church experienced this through persecution and mission. They were scattered like seeds into new contexts. They went out. They went deep. They became native to each context while maintaining their core identity. They engaged in the nooks and crannies of the Roman Empire, and the movement multiplied.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe maintained a commitment to incarnational mission. The Celtic monks practiced peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They left their homeland to engage in dangerous mission, becoming native to new cultures while maintaining their core identity. They took culture seriously, adapting their methods to each context while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

The Moravians, who sent out more missionaries in the first twenty years of their movement than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years, were characterized by incarnational mission. Their commitment to deep identification with the cultures they served enabled them to have transformative impact.

The Methodists went out into the fields and the factories. They went deep into the lives of working people. They became native to industrial England while maintaining their core identity. They engaged in the nooks and crannies, and the movement multiplied.

The Pentecostals went out into the streets and the neighborhoods. They went deep into the lives of ordinary people. They became native to each context while maintaining their core identity. They engaged in the nooks and crannies, and the movement multiplied.

The Chinese underground church went out into the villages and the cities. They went deep into the lives of the Chinese people. They became native to Chinese culture while maintaining their core identity. They engaged in the nooks and crannies, and the movement multiplied.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain the missional-incarnational impulse thrive. Movements that lose it decline. This impulse is not optional. It's essential. It's encoded in the very nature of the church.

---

## The Challenge for Us

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained in the attractional approach. We've been taught to build better programs, to create better services, to make our churches more appealing. We've been taught to expect people to come to us rather than going to them.

This is hard to unlearn. It's hard to shift from attractional to missional-incarnational. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of what we know, what we're comfortable with, what we've been taught.

But here's what I want you to see: the missional-incarnational impulse is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment of cultural shift, this moment when the attractional approach is showing its limits, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to reactivate it.

So here's my invitation to you: Come with me on this journey. Whether you're new to these ideas or coming back for metanoia, whether you're discovering or remembering, whether you're a beginner or someone who's been wrestling with these questions for years.

Come and rediscover the missional-incarnational impulse. Come and remember what we've forgotten. Come and reactivate what's been suppressed.

Come and go out. Come and go deep. Come and become native to your context. Come and engage in the nooks and crannies. Come and practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

Come and participate in what God is already doing.

## Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that missional-incarnational communities need all fivefold functions—APEST culture. When we go out and go deep, we need all five forms of intelligence working together. We need Apostles to pioneer, Prophets to discern, Evangelists to recruit, Shepherds to nurture, and Teachers to ground.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: the missional-incarnational impulse is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting.

We go out. We go deep. We become native to our context. We engage in the nooks and crannies. We practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we go out. We go deep. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we go out. We go deep. We become native to our context. We engage in the nooks and crannies. We participate in what God is already doing.
