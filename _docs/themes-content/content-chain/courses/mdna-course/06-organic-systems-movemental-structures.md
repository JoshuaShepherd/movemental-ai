# Chapter 6: Organic Systems—Movemental Structures

> "He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.'"  
> —Mark 4:26-29

## Anchor Scripture: The Growing Seed

**Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading**

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this parable. It's one of Jesus' most profound teachings about how the kingdom of God actually works. But I want you to read it slowly, contemplatively, noticing what it's actually saying.

Read it once, focusing on the seed: "A man scatters seed on the ground." Notice what the man does. He scatters. He plants. But then what? Does he control the growth? Does he make it happen? Does he engineer it?

Read it again, this time focusing on the growth: "Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how." Notice what happens. The seed grows. It sprouts. It develops. But the man doesn't know how. He doesn't control it. He doesn't engineer it. It happens "all by itself."

Read it a third time, focusing on the process: "All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head." Notice the sequence. First the stalk. Then the head. Then the full kernel. It's a process. It's organic. It's natural. It follows the pattern built into the seed itself.

Now read it one more time, focusing on the harvest: "As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come." Notice when the man acts. Not during the growth. Not during the process. Only when it's ripe. Only when the harvest has come.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. The kingdom of God grows organically. It follows patterns built into creation itself. It doesn't need to be engineered. It doesn't need to be controlled. It just needs the right conditions, and it grows.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just organizational theory. Not just management principles. We're exploring how movements organize themselves as living organisms rather than machines. We're exploring what it means to create organic systems—structures that enable multiplication rather than constrain it.

## The Starfish and the Spider

Let me start with an image that might help you see the difference between organic systems and institutional systems.

Think about a spider. A spider has a head. It has a central nervous system. It has a command center. If you cut off a spider's head, it dies. The spider is centralized. It's controlled from the center. It's a machine.

Now think about a starfish. A starfish doesn't have a head. It doesn't have a central nervous system. It has distributed intelligence. If you cut a starfish in half, you get two starfish. The starfish is decentralized. It's distributed. It's an organism.

This is the difference between institutions and movements. Institutions are like spiders. They have centralized control. They have hierarchies. They have command centers. If you remove the leadership, if you cut off the head, the institution dies.

Movements are like starfish. They have distributed intelligence. They have networks. They have DNA that can reproduce from any part. If you remove one part, the movement continues. If you cut it in half, you get two movements.

This is what I mean by organic systems. They're not machines to be controlled. They're organisms that grow. They're not programs to be run. They're living systems that multiply. They're not structures to be maintained. They're movements that spread.

And here's what's crucial: movements require organic systems. They can't function as institutions. They can't be controlled from the center. They can't be maintained through hierarchy. They need distributed intelligence. They need networks. They need DNA that can reproduce from any part.

---

## Machines vs. Organisms

But here's the problem: most of us have been trained to think of organizations as machines. We think of them as things to be designed, controlled, and maintained from outside. We think of them as programs to be run, structures to be built, systems to be managed.

But the Bible uses organic metaphors to describe the church. Not machines. Not programs. Not structures. Organisms. Living things. Growing things. Multiplying things.

Think about it. The church is described as a body. A vine. Branches. Seeds. Trees. A living temple. These are not decorative images. These are actual descriptors of how the church is designed to function.

When Jesus says "the kingdom of God is like...," he's not just using nice illustrations. He's describing the operational principles of kingdom growth. He's showing us how the kingdom actually works—organically, naturally, from within.

The kingdom is like a seed. It starts small. It grows. It multiplies. It follows patterns built into creation itself.

The kingdom is like yeast. It works from within. It spreads. It transforms. It doesn't need to be controlled. It just needs the right conditions.

The kingdom is like a tree. It grows. It branches. It bears fruit. It reproduces. It follows the pattern of life itself.

These are organic images. These are living systems. These are how movements actually work.

But here's what's happened: the church has been heavily influenced by the "organization-as-machine" metaphor. We've adopted mechanistic thinking. We've created hierarchical control. We've developed programmatic approaches. We've built institutional structures.

And this has killed movemental energy. It's killed multiplication. It's killed the organic nature of the church.

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems are not something we create or import. They're something we remember and reactivate. They're already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of mechanistic thinking. But they're there, waiting to be reactivated.

## The Five Characteristics of Organic Systems

Let me show you what organic systems actually look like. I want to give you five characteristics that distinguish organic systems from institutional systems.

**1. Reproducible**

Organic systems have an innate capacity to reproduce spontaneously and exponentially. Each part contains the potential of the whole. The DNA is present in every cell. The pattern can be replicated from any part.

Think about it. A seed contains the potential of the whole plant. A cell contains the potential of the whole organism. A disciple contains the potential of the whole movement. The DNA is there. The pattern is there. It just needs the right conditions, and it reproduces.

This is what makes movements multiply. Not through addition. Not through programs. Not through institutions. Through reproduction. Through DNA being passed on. Through patterns being replicated.

**2. Distributed**

Organic systems have no single point of failure. They have no central control. They have distributed intelligence. They have networks rather than hierarchies.

Think about it. A starfish has no head. It has distributed intelligence. If you remove one part, it continues. If you cut it in half, you get two starfish. The intelligence is distributed throughout the system.

This is what makes movements resilient. Not through central control. Not through hierarchical authority. Through distributed intelligence. Through networks. Through every part having the capacity to function independently while remaining connected.

**3. Adaptive**

Organic systems respond to context while maintaining DNA. They adapt to local conditions. They adjust to changing circumstances. But they maintain their core identity. They preserve their essential DNA.

Think about it. A tree adapts to its environment. It grows toward the light. It adjusts to the soil. It responds to the climate. But it remains a tree. It maintains its DNA. It preserves its essential nature.

This is what makes movements effective in different contexts. Not through rigid programs. Not through one-size-fits-all approaches. Through adaptation. Through contextualization. Through maintaining DNA while adapting to context.

**4. Simple**

Organic systems operate on simple rules that enable complex emergence. They don't need complicated procedures. They don't need detailed policies. They need simple principles. They need clear DNA. They need reproducible patterns.

Think about it. A seed doesn't need a manual. It doesn't need instructions. It has simple DNA. It has clear patterns. It follows the rules built into creation itself. And from that simplicity, complexity emerges.

This is what makes movements scalable. Not through complicated systems. Not through detailed procedures. Through simplicity. Through clear DNA. Through reproducible patterns that can be passed on easily.

**5. Fractal**

Organic systems have patterns that repeat at every scale. The same pattern appears at the local level, the regional level, the global level. The DNA is the same. The principles are the same. The patterns are the same.

Think about it. A tree has branches. The branches have smaller branches. The smaller branches have twigs. The pattern repeats. The DNA is the same. The principles are the same. The patterns are the same at every scale.

This is what makes movements coherent at scale. Not through central control. Not through hierarchical management. Through fractal patterns. Through DNA that repeats at every scale. Through principles that work at every level.

## The Contrast with Institutional Systems

But here's what I want you to see: institutional systems work differently. They rely on:

**Centralized Control** — Everything flows from the center. Decisions are made at the top. Authority is concentrated. Control is maintained through hierarchy.

**Hierarchical Authority** — There's a clear chain of command. There are levels of authority. There are positions of power. Control is maintained through structure.

**Program Replication** — Programs are designed at the center and replicated in other places. The same program is run everywhere. Control is maintained through standardization.

**Resource Accumulation** — Resources are gathered at the center and distributed from there. Control is maintained through resource management.

**Professional Management** — Professionals are trained to manage the system. Control is maintained through expertise.

These are mechanistic approaches. These are machine thinking. These are how institutions work.

But movements don't work this way. Movements work organically. They work like organisms. They work like living systems.

Movements don't need centralized control. They need distributed intelligence. Movements don't need hierarchical authority. They need networks. Movements don't need program replication. They need DNA replication. Movements don't need resource accumulation. They need resource multiplication. Movements don't need professional management. They need organic leadership.

This is the difference. This is why movements require organic systems. This is why institutions can't become movements without fundamental change.

---

## Organized but Not Institutionalized

But here's a crucial distinction: organic systems are organized, but they're not institutionalized.

Organization is necessary. Structure is necessary. Systems are necessary. But there's a difference between organization that enables movement and organization that kills movement.

Organization that enables movement is:
- Flexible rather than rigid
- Adaptive rather than fixed
- Distributed rather than centralized
- Simple rather than complicated
- Reproducible rather than controlled

Organization that kills movement is:
- Rigid rather than flexible
- Fixed rather than adaptive
- Centralized rather than distributed
- Complicated rather than simple
- Controlled rather than reproducible

The challenge is to create systems that are organized but not institutionalized—that provide necessary structure without killing movemental energy.

This is the tension. This is the challenge. This is what movements must navigate.

We need organization. We need structure. We need systems. But we need them to enable movement, not constrain it. We need them to support multiplication, not control it. We need them to facilitate adaptation, not prevent it.

This is what organic systems do. They provide organization without institutionalization. They provide structure without rigidity. They provide systems without control.

---

## Simple Rules, Complex Emergence

But how do we actually create organic systems? How do we provide organization without institutionalization? How do we enable movement rather than constrain it?

I believe the answer is simple rules. Organic systems operate on simple rules that enable complex emergence.

Think about it. A flock of birds doesn't need a leader telling each bird where to go. It operates on simple rules: stay close to your neighbors, match their speed, avoid obstacles. From these simple rules, complex behavior emerges. The flock moves as one. It turns together. It responds to threats. All from simple rules.

A colony of ants doesn't need a manager telling each ant what to do. It operates on simple rules: follow the pheromone trail, gather food, return to the nest. From these simple rules, complex behavior emerges. The colony finds food. It builds nests. It defends itself. All from simple rules.

This is how organic systems work. They don't need complicated procedures. They don't need detailed policies. They need simple rules. They need clear principles. They need reproducible patterns.

For movements, the simple rules might be:
- Make disciples
- Go to people
- Become native to your context
- Express all five functions
- Reproduce the DNA
- Trust the process

These are simple. These are clear. These are reproducible. And from these simple rules, complex movement emerges.

---

## Common Language and Reproducible Practices

But simple rules alone aren't enough. We also need common language and reproducible practices.

**Common Language** — We need shared vocabulary that carries meaning. We need words that everyone understands. We need language that communicates DNA. We need terms that enable communication across networks.

Think about it. The early church had common language. They spoke of "the Way." They spoke of "the gospel." They spoke of "disciples." These terms carried meaning. They communicated DNA. They enabled communication across networks.

Movements need common language. They need shared vocabulary. They need words that carry meaning. They need language that communicates DNA.

**Reproducible Practices** — We need patterns that can be passed on. We need practices that can be replicated. We need rhythms that can be shared. We need habits that can be learned.

Think about it. The early church had reproducible practices. They broke bread together. They prayed together. They shared resources. They made disciples. These practices could be passed on. They could be replicated. They could be shared.

Movements need reproducible practices. They need patterns that can be passed on. They need practices that can be replicated. They need rhythms that can be shared.

Common language and reproducible practices enable organic systems to maintain coherence while remaining distributed. They enable DNA to be passed on. They enable patterns to be replicated. They enable movement to multiply.

---

## Distributed Leadership

But here's another crucial element: organic systems require distributed leadership.

Institutional systems concentrate leadership at the top. They have hierarchies. They have command centers. They have positions of power.

Organic systems distribute leadership throughout. They have networks. They have distributed intelligence. They have leadership at every level.

Think about it. A starfish has no head. It has distributed intelligence. Every part can function independently. Every part can lead. Every part can respond.

This is what movements need. Not centralized leadership. Not hierarchical authority. Distributed leadership. Intelligence throughout the system. Leadership at every level.

This doesn't mean there's no leadership. It means leadership is distributed. It means intelligence is throughout the system. It means every part can function independently while remaining connected.

This is what enables movements to multiply. Not through central control. Not through hierarchical management. Through distributed leadership. Through intelligence throughout the system. Through every part having the capacity to lead.

---

## Networks, Not Hierarchies

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems create networks, not hierarchies.

Hierarchies concentrate power at the top. They create dependency. They create bottlenecks. They create single points of failure.

Networks distribute power throughout. They create independence. They create multiple pathways. They create resilience.

Think about it. A hierarchy is like a tree. Everything flows from the trunk. If you cut the trunk, the tree dies. If you remove the top, the system fails.

A network is like a web. There are multiple pathways. There are multiple connections. If you remove one part, the network continues. If you cut one connection, other connections remain.

This is what movements need. Not hierarchies. Not centralized structures. Networks. Distributed connections. Multiple pathways.

Networks enable organic systems to function. They enable distributed intelligence. They enable independent action. They enable multiplication.

---

## Passing on DNA

But here's the crucial question: How do organic systems pass on DNA? How do they maintain coherence while remaining distributed? How do they preserve identity while adapting to context?

I believe the answer is relationships, stories, and practices.

**Relationships** — DNA is passed on through relationships. Not through policies. Not through procedures. Through relationships. Through people knowing people. Through disciples making disciples. Through relationships that carry DNA.

Think about it. The early church passed on DNA through relationships. Paul discipled Timothy. Timothy discipled others. The DNA was passed on through relationships. Through people knowing people. Through disciples making disciples.

**Stories** — DNA is passed on through stories. Not through manuals. Not through documents. Through stories. Through narratives that carry meaning. Through accounts that communicate DNA.

Think about it. The early church passed on DNA through stories. They told the story of Jesus. They shared their own stories. The DNA was passed on through stories. Through narratives that carried meaning.

**Practices** — DNA is passed on through practices. Not through programs. Not through events. Through practices. Through rhythms that embody DNA. Through habits that express identity.

Think about it. The early church passed on DNA through practices. They broke bread together. They prayed together. They made disciples. The DNA was passed on through practices. Through rhythms that embodied DNA.

Relationships, stories, and practices. These are how organic systems pass on DNA. These are how movements maintain coherence. These are how identity is preserved while adapting to context.

---

## Multiplication, Not Addition

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems multiply, they don't just add.

Addition is linear. One plus one equals two. Two plus one equals three. Three plus one equals four. It's slow. It's incremental. It's controlled.

Multiplication is exponential. One times two equals two. Two times two equals four. Four times two equals eight. Eight times two equals sixteen. It's fast. It's explosive. It's organic.

Think about it. A seed doesn't add. It multiplies. One seed produces many seeds. Many seeds produce many more seeds. It's exponential. It's organic. It's how life actually works.

This is what movements do. They don't add. They multiply. One disciple makes two disciples. Two disciples make four disciples. Four disciples make eight disciples. It's exponential. It's organic. It's how movements actually work.

But here's the problem: institutions add. They don't multiply. They grow through addition. They expand through programs. They increase through events. But they don't multiply. They don't reproduce. They don't create exponential growth.

This is why movements require organic systems. They need systems that enable multiplication. They need structures that support reproduction. They need organization that facilitates exponential growth.

---

## The Work of the Holy Spirit

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization.

Institutional systems try to engineer organization through human systems. They try to control through policies. They try to manage through procedures. They try to maintain through structures.

Organic systems trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization. They recognize that the church is a work of the Spirit. They trust that the Spirit will organize. They believe that the Spirit will guide.

Think about it. The Holy Spirit is the essence of life. The Holy Spirit brooded over the chaos of creation and brought order. The Holy Spirit continues to bring order and design. The Holy Spirit is the one who organizes the church.

Organic systems recognize this. They trust the Holy Spirit. They don't try to engineer what the Spirit will do. They don't try to control what the Spirit will create. They trust. They wait. They participate.

This is what enables organic systems to function. Not through human engineering. Not through human control. Through trust in the Holy Spirit. Through participation in what the Spirit is doing.

---

## Connecting Back to Jesus' Lordship

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom Jesus announced.

When Jesus is Lord, and when the kingdom operates according to organic principles, then our systems must reflect those principles. They must work with the grain of how life actually multiplies, not against it.

This is the connection between "Jesus is Lord" and organic systems. When Jesus is Lord, we follow him. We become like him. We organize as he organized. We multiply as he multiplied.

This is also the connection between disciple-making and organic systems. When we make disciples, we're creating reproducible DNA. We're passing on patterns. We're enabling multiplication.

This is also the connection between missional-incarnational impulse and organic systems. When we go out and go deep, we need systems that enable multiplication. We need structures that support reproduction.

This is also the connection between APEST culture and organic systems. When we have all five functions operating, we need systems that enable them to work together. We need structures that support distributed intelligence.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we organize organically. We create systems that enable multiplication. We trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization.

---

## Historical Examples

Let me show you how this has worked in movements throughout history.

The early church organized organically. They used networks. They used relationships. They used simple structures. They passed on DNA through relationships, stories, and practices. They multiplied exponentially. They grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries.

The Celtic movement organized organically. They used monastic communities as nodes in a network. They maintained coherence through shared practices and values. They adapted to local contexts while maintaining core identity. They multiplied throughout Western Europe.

The Moravians organized organically. They used small groups and networks. They maintained coherence through shared mission and values. They grew through multiplication, sending out missionaries who started new communities.

The Chinese underground church organized organically. They used house churches and networks. They maintained coherence through shared DNA and simple structures. They grew exponentially through multiplication, adapting to local contexts while maintaining core identity.

The pattern is clear: movements that organize organically thrive. Movements that organize mechanistically decline. Organic systems are not optional. They're essential. They're encoded in the very nature of the church.

---

## The Challenge for Us

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained in mechanistic thinking. We've been taught to think of organizations as machines. We've been taught to control through policies. We've been taught to manage through procedures.

This is hard to unlearn. It's hard to shift from mechanistic to organic. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of what we know, what we're comfortable with, what we've been taught.

But here's what I want you to see: organic systems are not something we create or import. They're something we remember and reactivate. They're already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of mechanistic thinking. But they're there, waiting to be reactivated.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment when mechanistic models are showing their limits, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to reactivate them.

So here's my invitation to you: Come with me on this journey. Whether you're new to these ideas or coming back for metanoia, whether you're discovering or remembering, whether you're a beginner or someone who's been wrestling with these questions for years.

Come and rediscover organic systems. Come and remember what we've forgotten. Come and reactivate what's been suppressed.

Come and create systems that enable multiplication. Come and build structures that support reproduction. Come and organize in ways that work with the grain of how life actually multiplies.

Come and participate in what God is already doing.

## Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that organic systems create the conditions for communitas—liminal community forged in shared adventure. When we organize organically, when we go out and go deep together, when we face shared challenges and risks, communitas emerges.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: organic systems are not something we create or import. They're something we remember and reactivate. They're already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But they're there, waiting.

We create systems that enable multiplication. We build structures that support reproduction. We organize in ways that work with the grain of how life actually multiplies.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we organize organically. We create systems that enable multiplication. We trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we organize organically. We create systems that enable multiplication. We participate in what God is already doing.
