## Anchor Scripture: Making Everything New

**Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading**

Before we bring this journey to a close, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's from the end of the book of Revelation, from a vision of the new heaven and the new earth. But I want you to read it slowly, contemplatively, noticing what it's actually saying.

Read it once, focusing on who is speaking: "He who was seated on the throne said..." Notice who is doing the speaking. It's not us. It's not the church. It's God. The one seated on the throne. The one who is making everything new.

Read it again, this time focusing on what is being said: "I am making everything new!" Notice the verb. It's present tense. It's active. It's ongoing. God is making everything new. Not "I will make." Not "I made." But "I am making." Right now. In this moment. Always.

Read it a third time, focusing on the scope: "everything new." Notice what's being made new. Not some things. Not most things. Everything. All of it. The whole creation. The whole cosmos. Everything.

Now read it in context. Read Revelation 21:1-5: "Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.' He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new!'"

Notice the vision. A new heaven and a new earth. A new Jerusalem. God dwelling with his people. No more death. No more mourning. No more crying. No more pain. The old order has passed away. Everything is being made new.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. God is making everything new. Right now. In this moment. Always. And this includes the church. This includes movement. This includes you.

This is what we've been exploring together. Not just movement DNA. Not just church strategy. We've been exploring what it means to participate in what God is already doing—making everything new. We've been exploring what it means to remember what we've forgotten. We've been exploring what it means to reactivate what's been suppressed.

## Bringing It All Together

We've come a long way together. We've explored six essential elements of movement DNA. We've seen how each element connects to the others. We've discovered how they work together to create something greater than the sum of their parts.

Let me remind you of what we've explored:

**Jesus Is Lord** — The foundation. The center. The heart. Everything flows from here. Everything returns here. This is not just one element among six. This is the element that gives meaning and coherence to all the others.

**Disciple-Making** — The essential practice. Not the first step on a journey beyond which we move, but the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples. We are always disciples in the making.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse** — Going out and going deep. Two movements, one reality. Like scissor blades that work together. We go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. We become native to our context rather than remaining foreign.

**APEST Culture** — The fivefold intelligence. Not just roles, but forms of intelligence distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. All five functions operating together to attain the fullness of Christ.

**Organic Systems** — Movemental structures. Not machines to be controlled, but organisms that grow. Reproducible, distributed, adaptive, simple, fractal. Systems that enable multiplication rather than constrain it.

**Communitas** — Liminal community. Not just community, but community forged in shared adventure, in common mission, in the experience of being "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

These are the six elements. These are movement DNA. These are what we've been exploring together.

But here's what I want you to see: these elements don't work in isolation. They work together. They need each other. They create something together that none of them can create alone.

---

## When All Six Work Together

But what happens when all six elements work together? What emerges when Jesus is Lord gives meaning to disciple-making, which flows into missional-incarnational impulse, which requires APEST culture, which needs organic systems, which creates communitas?

This is what I call **Apostolic Genius**—not the sum of the parts, but the emergent property that appears when the system activates.

Think about it like this. Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. But water has properties that neither hydrogen nor oxygen has alone. You can't drink hydrogen. You can't swim in oxygen. But you can drink water. You can swim in water. Water is something new that emerges when hydrogen and oxygen combine.

Apostolic Genius is like that. It's not just the six elements added together. It's something new that emerges when all six elements work together. It's a property that appears when the system activates. It's the mysterious, powerful, movemental energy that transforms communities into world-changing movements.

When all six elements are present and operating together:
- Jesus is Lord gives meaning and coherence to everything
- Disciple-making flows from Jesus' lordship and enables multiplication
- Missional-incarnational impulse sends people out and deep into culture
- APEST culture provides all five forms of intelligence needed for movement
- Organic systems enable multiplication rather than constrain it
- Communitas creates the deep bonds that enable people to face challenges together

And from this combination, something emerges. Something powerful. Something transformative. Something that can't be engineered or controlled. Something that can only be described as Apostolic Genius.

This is what the early church experienced. This is what the Chinese underground church experienced. This is what the Methodists experienced. This is what the Pentecostals experienced. This is what every significant movement in history has experienced.

When all six elements work together, Apostolic Genius emerges. And when Apostolic Genius emerges, movements form. Movements multiply. Movements transform.

---

## Not the Sum, But Something More

But here's what I want you to see: Apostolic Genius is not the sum of the parts. It's something more. It's something greater. It's an emergent property.

Think about it. You can have all six elements present, but if they're not working together, if they're not integrated, if they're not functioning as a system, Apostolic Genius doesn't emerge. It's not enough to have the elements. They have to work together. They have to be integrated. They have to function as a system.

This is why movements require all six elements. Not some. Not most. All. Because they work together. They need each other. They create something together that none of them can create alone.

This is also why you can't pick and choose. You can't say, "We'll focus on disciple-making and missional-incarnational impulse, but we'll skip APEST culture." Or "We'll have organic systems and communitas, but we don't need to focus on Jesus is Lord." It doesn't work that way. All six are needed. All six must work together.

This is the systemic nature of movement DNA. It's not a checklist. It's not a menu. It's a system. And systems require all their parts to function properly.

---

## Remembering, Not Creating

But here's what I want you to remember: mDNA isn't something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate.

The six elements are already there. They're in every believer. They're in every expression of church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of institutional thinking, consumer patterns, attractional models. But they're there, waiting to be reactivated.

Think about it. The early church didn't create movement DNA. They discovered it. They activated it. They remembered what was already there.

The Chinese underground church didn't import movement DNA. They recovered it. They reactivated it. They remembered what they had forgotten.

The Methodists didn't invent movement DNA. They rediscovered it. They reactivated it. They remembered what had been suppressed.

This is the pattern. This is how movements form. Not through creating something new. Not through importing something foreign. But through remembering what we've forgotten. Through reactivating what's been suppressed. Through recovering what's already there.

The DNA is already encoded. The seed is already planted. The potential is already present. We just need to remember. We just need to reactivate. We just need to participate in what God is already doing.

---

## The Reality of Metanoia

But here's the reality: reactivating mDNA isn't easy. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation.

It requires letting go of institutional thinking. It requires letting go of consumer patterns. It requires letting go of attractional models. It requires letting go of what we know, what we're comfortable with, what we've been taught.

It requires courage. It requires risk. It requires adventure. It requires being willing to step into liminal space, to face uncertainty, to engage in shared mission and adventure.

It requires metanoia. Not just learning new information. Not just adopting new strategies. But deep rethinking. Paradigm shifts. Wholehearted transformation.

Think about it. The early church experienced metanoia. They had to rethink everything. They had to let go of their old ways of thinking. They had to embrace a new way of being.

The Chinese underground church experienced metanoia. They had to rethink everything. They had to let go of institutional models. They had to embrace movemental thinking.

The Methodists experienced metanoia. They had to rethink everything. They had to let go of settled patterns. They had to embrace missional engagement.

This is what metanoia requires. Deep rethinking. Paradigm shifts. Wholehearted transformation. It's not easy. It's not comfortable. It's not safe. But it's necessary. It's essential. It's how movements form.

---

## The Future Lies in the Womb of the Present

But here's what I want you to remember: the future lies in the womb of the present. The seed is already there. The DNA is already encoded. The potential for movement already exists.

We don't need to create something new. We don't need to import something foreign. We don't need to wait for the perfect conditions. We just need to remember what we've forgotten. We just need to reactivate what's been suppressed. We just need to participate in what God is already doing.

Think about it. The seed is already planted. The DNA is already encoded. The potential is already present. In you. In your community. In every expression of church.

The question is not whether movement DNA exists. It does. The question is whether we'll remember it. Whether we'll reactivate it. Whether we'll participate in what God is already doing.

This is the invitation. This is the opportunity. This is the moment. Not to create something new. Not to import something foreign. But to remember what we've forgotten. To reactivate what's been suppressed. To participate in what God is already doing.

## The Journey Ahead

But here's what I want you to know: this is not the end. This is the beginning.

You've rediscovered movement DNA. You've explored the six elements. You've seen how they work together. You've discovered Apostolic Genius.

But now what? How will you reactivate movement DNA in your context? How will you remember what you've forgotten? How will you participate in what God is already doing?

This is the question. This is the challenge. This is the invitation.

I can't answer this for you. I can't tell you exactly what to do. I can't give you a formula or a program. But I can point you in the right direction. I can remind you of what's essential. I can invite you to participate in what God is already doing.

So here's my invitation to you: Begin where you are. Start with what you have. Remember what you've forgotten. Reactivate what's been suppressed.

Start with Jesus is Lord. Make this the center. Make this the foundation. Make this the heart of everything.

Then make disciple-making the essential practice. Not a program. Not a class. But the journey itself. The ongoing practice of becoming like Jesus and inviting others to do the same.

Then develop the missional-incarnational impulse. Go out. Go deep. Become native to your context. Engage in the nooks and crannies. Practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

Then create APEST culture. Discover your calling. Develop all five functions. Create an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued, activated, and working together.

Then build organic systems. Create structures that enable multiplication. Design systems that are reproducible, distributed, adaptive, simple, and fractal. Be organized but not institutionalized.

Then form communitas. Create liminal spaces. Engage in shared adventure. Face challenges together. Become "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

And as you do, watch what happens. Watch how the elements work together. Watch how Apostolic Genius emerges. Watch how movement forms.

## Which Element Needs Attention?

But here's a practical question: Which element needs the most attention in your context right now?

Maybe it's Jesus is Lord. Maybe you need to recenter everything on the lordship of Jesus. Maybe you need to make this the foundation, the center, the heart of everything.

Maybe it's disciple-making. Maybe you need to make this the essential practice. Maybe you need to shift from programs to discipleship, from information to transformation.

Maybe it's missional-incarnational impulse. Maybe you need to go out and go deep. Maybe you need to shift from attractional to missional, from foreign to native.

Maybe it's APEST culture. Maybe you need to recover the exiled functions. Maybe you need to create an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued and activated.

Maybe it's organic systems. Maybe you need to shift from mechanistic to organic thinking. Maybe you need to create systems that enable multiplication rather than constrain it.

Maybe it's communitas. Maybe you need to create liminal spaces. Maybe you need to engage in shared adventure. Maybe you need to form deep bonds through shared mission and risk.

Or maybe it's all of them. Maybe you need to work on all six at once. Maybe you need to create the conditions for all six to work together.

I can't tell you which one. But you can. You know your context. You know what's missing. You know what needs attention.

So start there. Start with what needs the most attention. Start with what's most urgent. Start with what will make the biggest difference.

And as you do, remember: they all work together. They all need each other. They all create something together that none of them can create alone.

---

## Your Next Step

But here's what I want you to do: Create an action plan. Not a grand plan. Not a comprehensive strategy. But a next step. A concrete action. Something you can do. Something you can begin.

Maybe it's taking an APEST assessment to discover your calling. Maybe it's identifying one person you can begin discipling. Maybe it's finding one "nook and cranny" where you can practice presence and proximity. Maybe it's creating one liminal experience that enables communitas to form. Maybe it's designing one simple, reproducible practice that can be passed on.

I don't know what it is. But you do. You know your context. You know your capacity. You know your next step.

So take it. Begin. Start. Don't wait for the perfect conditions. Don't wait for everything to be in place. Begin where you are. Start with what you have. Take the next step.

And as you do, remember: you're not alone. You're part of a larger movement. You're participating in what God is already doing. You're remembering what we've all forgotten. You're reactivating what's been suppressed.

---

## The Support You Need

But here's what I want you to know: you don't have to do this alone. You need support. You need community. You need others who are on this journey with you.

Find people who are also rediscovering movement DNA. Find communities that are reactivating what's been suppressed. Find resources that can help you go deeper. Find mentors who can guide you. Find peers who can journey with you.

You need support. You need community. You need others. Don't try to do this alone. Don't try to figure it all out by yourself. Find support. Find community. Find others.

And as you do, remember: this is not just about you. It's about participating in what God is already doing. It's about remembering what we've all forgotten. It's about reactivating what's been suppressed in the whole church.

So find support. Find community. Find others. And together, remember. Together, reactivate. Together, participate in what God is already doing.

## The Ongoing Journey

But here's what I want you to remember: this is not the end. This is the beginning.

You've completed this primer. You've explored the six elements. You've discovered Apostolic Genius. You've begun to remember what you've forgotten.

But the journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

There are deeper resources to explore. There are other books to read. There are communities to join. There are practices to develop. There are movements to participate in.

This primer is just the beginning. It's an entry point. It's a foundation. It's a starting place.

But the journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

So keep going. Keep exploring. Keep remembering. Keep reactivating. Keep participating in what God is already doing.

## A Final Reminder

But before we end, let me remind you of one thing: Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center.

**Jesus is Lord.** This is not just one element among six. This is the foundation. The center. The heart. Everything else flows from here. Everything else returns here.

When Jesus is Lord, disciple-making flows from his lordship. Mission flows from his lordship. APEST flows from his lordship. Organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom he announced. Communitas reflects the nature of the community he created.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. This is the theological logic. This is the missional logic. This is the movement logic.

So keep this at the center. Keep Jesus at the center. Keep his lordship at the center. And everything else will find its place. Everything else will flow from there. Everything else will return there.
