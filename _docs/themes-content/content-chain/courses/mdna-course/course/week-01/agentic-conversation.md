# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you are in your journey and what questions you're bringing.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify where they are in their journey—new discovery or metanoia moment? What questions are they bringing? What movement DNA might already be active (or suppressed) in their context?

**Sample Prompts:**
- What brought you to this moment? What questions are you carrying?
- Are you discovering these ideas for the first time, or are you coming back to them for metanoia—deep rethinking and remembering?
- Where do you see movement DNA already active in your context? Where is it suppressed?
- What would it mean for you to "remember" rather than "learn" movement DNA?
