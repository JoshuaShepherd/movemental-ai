## Reading Practice: Lectio Divina

Before we dive into the content of this chapter, I want to invite you to spend a few minutes with this verse from Romans 11. It's a simple sentence, really. Just ten words in English. But it contains everything.

Take a moment. Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*For from him and through him and for him are all things.*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the first phrase: "from him." What does it mean that all things come *from* him? What is the source? What is the origin?

Read it a third time, focusing on "through him." What does it mean that all things come *through* him? What is the means? What is the pathway?

Read it one more time, focusing on "for him." What does it mean that all things are *for* him? What is the purpose? What is the end?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just movement DNA, not just church strategy, not just organizational theory. We're exploring what it means that everything—everything—comes from him, through him, and for him. And if that's true, then what does it mean for the church? What does it mean for movement? What does it mean for you?
