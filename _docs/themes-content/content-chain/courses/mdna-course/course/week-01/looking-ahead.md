# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to dive deep into the foundation: **Jesus Is Lord**. This is not just one element among six. This is the heart of it all. The center from which everything else flows.

When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems. What remains is this: Jesus is Lord.

We'll explore how this confession represents the core of biblical monotheism, how it eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority, how it demands total allegiance, and how it gives meaning and coherence to all the other elements of movement DNA.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: this is not about adding something new. This is about remembering what we've forgotten. This is about reactivating what's been suppressed.

The DNA is already there. The seed is already planted. The potential is already present.

We just need to remember. We just need to reactivate. We just need to participate in what God is already doing.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from him, through him, and for him.

Everything. Always. Forever.
