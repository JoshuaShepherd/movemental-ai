# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **What brought you to this moment?** What questions are you carrying? What's driving your interest in movement DNA?

2. **Where are you in your journey?** Are you discovering these ideas for the first time, or are you coming back to them for metanoia—that deep rethinking and remembering? What does that mean for how you approach this material?

3. **Where do you see movement DNA already active in your context?** What elements are present? What's working? What gives you hope?

4. **Where is movement DNA suppressed in your context?** What elements are missing? What obstacles stand in the way? What needs to be reactivated?

5. **What would it mean for you to "remember" rather than "learn" movement DNA?** How would that shift your approach? What would change?

6. **How does Romans 11:36—"For from him and through him and for him are all things"—speak to you right now?** What does it mean that everything comes from him, through him, and for him? How does that connect to movement?

7. **What's your next step?** What do you need to do to engage this journey fully? What support do you need? What questions do you want to explore further?
