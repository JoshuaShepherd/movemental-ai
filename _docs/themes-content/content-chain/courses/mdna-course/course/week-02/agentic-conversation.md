# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify competing "lords" in your life and context, and explore what it would mean to make "Jesus is Lord" the center.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify competing "lords" in their lives and contexts. What authorities are claiming ultimate allegiance? How would living as if "Jesus is Lord" actually change things? What would it look like to make this confession the center of their community?

**Sample Prompts:**
- What competing "lords" are claiming authority in your life right now? In your community?
- How would living as if "Jesus is Lord" actually change your priorities, decisions, practices?
- What areas of your life feel "secular" or disconnected from God? How might bringing them under Jesus' lordship change that?
- What would it look like to make "Jesus is Lord" the center of your community's identity and practice?
- Where do you see the sacred-secular divide operating in your context? How might you challenge it?
