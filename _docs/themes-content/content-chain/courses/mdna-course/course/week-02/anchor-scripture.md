## Reading Practice: Meditative Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with these two passages. They're not just verses to read quickly and move on. They're foundational declarations that have shaped the faith of God's people for millennia.

First, read the Shema slowly. Let it sink in:

*Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, The Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.*

This is the central confession of biblical monotheism. This is what Jesus called the greatest commandment. This is what the early church held onto when everything else was stripped away.

Now read Paul's words from 1 Corinthians:

*For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.*

Notice what Paul does here. He doesn't abandon the Shema. He doesn't replace it. He reinterprets it through Jesus. The one God is the Father. The one Lord is Jesus Christ. This is christocentric monotheism—monotheism centered on and defined by Jesus.

Now read them together. How do they connect? What does it mean that the one Lord of the Shema is now revealed as Jesus? What does it mean for Jesus to be Lord over every sphere of life?

Take a moment. Meditate on this. Let it shape how you approach everything else in this chapter.
