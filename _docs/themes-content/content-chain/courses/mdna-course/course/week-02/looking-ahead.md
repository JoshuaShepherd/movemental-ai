# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that Jesus' lordship calls us to become like him—disciples who make disciples. If Jesus is Lord, then we follow him. We learn from him. We become like him. And we invite others to do the same.

This is disciple-making—not the first step on a journey beyond which we move, but the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples. We are always disciples in the making.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: "Jesus is Lord" is not just a confession we make with our lips. It's a reality we live with our lives. It's the center from which everything else flows. It's the heart of it all.

Everything flows from him. Everything comes through him. Everything is for him.

Even movement. Especially movement.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**.
