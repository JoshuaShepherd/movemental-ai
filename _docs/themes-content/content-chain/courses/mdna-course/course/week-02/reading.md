# Week 2: Jesus Is Lord—The Heart of It All

## Not Just One Element Among Six

I need to be clear about something from the start: "Jesus is Lord" is not just one element among six in movement DNA. This is the foundation. The center. The heart. Everything else flows from here. Everything else returns here.

When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence—when all the external structures are removed, when all access to outside sources is cut off, when everything nonessential is stripped away—what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems. What remains is this: **Jesus is Lord**.

This is what the early church discovered. This is what the Chinese underground church discovered. This is what every significant movement in history has discovered. When you're forced to the core, when you're driven to the essence, when you're pushed to remember what really matters, this is what you find: Jesus is Lord.

And here's what's remarkable: this simple confession, when it becomes the center of a community's life, unleashes extraordinary power. It's not complicated. It's not elaborate. It's not sophisticated. But it's everything.

Because when Jesus is Lord, everything else finds its place. Disciple-making flows from Jesus' lordship. Mission flows from Jesus' lordship. APEST flows from Jesus' lordship. Organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom Jesus announced. Communitas reflects the nature of the community Jesus created.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. This is the theological logic that undergirds everything.

## The Gift of Persecution

Let me tell you something that might surprise you: persecution has a gift to give. I know that sounds strange, maybe even offensive. But it's true.

When movements are persecuted—when they're driven underground, when they're forced into relational networks to sustain themselves, when they have to jettison all unnecessary impediments—something remarkable happens. They're forced to condense and purify their core message. They're forced to remember what's essential. They're forced to recover what they've forgotten.

This is what happened to the early church. This is what happened to the Chinese underground church. When all the weighty systematic theologies and churchly dogma that only a professional theologian could understand were stripped away, when all the unnecessary complexities were extracted, a miracle happened: faith was once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus, the Author and Completer of the faith.

At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple, uncluttered, Jesus-centered message. Not simplistic. Not reductionist. But simple—easily grasped by any person, easily transferable from one person to another, easily reproducible in any context.

Something else is unleashed in this recovery of simplicity—namely, the missional potencies inherent in the people of God. When the message is simple, when it's transferable, when it's reproducible, it spreads. It multiplies. It becomes an epidemic of good news.

This is clearly the situation of the gospel in the early church. This is clearly the situation of the gospel in the Chinese underground church. And this is what we need to recover in our context: the core message, the essential confession, the heart of it all.

**Jesus is Lord.**

## Hear, O Israel

So what is that message? What does it look and feel like when reduced to utter simplicity?

This study of historical movements—the early church, the Chinese underground church, the Methodists, the Pentecostals—reveals that at the heart of all authentic Jesus movements lies a recovery of biblical monotheism. Not as abstract theological speculation, but as an existential encounter with the one God who both creates and redeems, who is both transcendent and immanent, who is both holy and present.

This might sound obvious to those overly familiar with it, but the belief that God is one lies at the heart of all authentic expressions of faith throughout history. This irreducible affirmation is what I want to explore with you, and I want to do it in light of the Hebraic understanding of life. I want to ground it in the Shema Yisrael—"Hear, O Israel"—based on Deuteronomy 6:4.

When we say "Jesus is Lord," we're not just making a simple affirmation that Jesus is our Master and we are his servants. We're making a confession that touches on the nature of God, his relation to his world as King, and his covenantal relationship with his people. This confession relates to the defining encounter, the redemptive experience that forms the basis of our relationship with God.

To truly appreciate the power and centrality of this claim, we need to understand the context into which it was first spoken. We need to understand what it was up against.

## The World of Many Gods

Imagine living in the ancient Near East, in a world where every aspect of life was ruled by a different god. You want to draw water from the river? You need to appease the river god. You want to plant crops? You need to please the fertility god. You want to travel? You need to placate the travel god. You want to do business? You need to honor the commerce god.

Every seemingly routine activity was fraught with spiritual complexity. Every action required religious ritual. Every decision involved multiple deities, most of whom were not very pleasant characters. Life was complex, dangerous, and exhausting.

Into this context came the Shema:

*Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one. Love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.*

This declaration, in this religious context, has direct and far-reaching implications. No longer could there be different gods for the different spheres of life: a god of the temple, another god of politics, a different god for fertility in the field, yet another for the river, and so on. Rather, Yahweh is the ONE (only) God who presides over all of life—home, field, politics, work, and everything in between.

The religious task was to honor him in all of life. As Paul would later say, "For from him and through him and for him are all things" (Romans 11:36).

This also sets the agenda for the central religious task of discipleship. It is a call for wholehearted devotion to the one God, not under the tyranny of many gods. Thus the covenant between Israel and Yahweh includes a total ban on idols and false gods (Exodus 20:2-5).

When God invades human consciousness, reliance on "peace and security" vanishes from every nook of existence. Life as a single whole becomes vulnerable. Broken down are the bulkheads between the chambers which confine life to separate compartments. The whole person is called to full responsibility for total obedience to an absolute demand.

Yahweh's lordship is at once complete and graceful salvation as well as total, unqualified demand. In biblical faith, salvation and lordship are inseparable. You cannot have one without the other.

## All of Life Under God

Here's what the Shema means: God is ONE, and the task of our lives is to bring every aspect of our lives under his rule. This "practical monotheism" lies at the epicenter of Israel's, and therefore the biblical, concept of faith. The entire Torah (which means "the instruction") is directed at fulfilling it.

When reading the Pentateuch, one might notice that it seems to jump from one subject to another—from issues of sublime theology to matters of seemingly mundane daily life. One verse deals with the Israelite's approach to God in the temple. The very next might well deal with mildew in the kitchen, the next with the female menstrual cycle, the next with how to treat a neighbor.

What is going on here? How can this make sense?

There is actually a rather profound logic in this. The implications of following the Torah faithfully will be to connect all things to God—worship and everything in between. Therefore, everything—one's work, one's family, one's economics, one's politics, one's sexuality—is brought under the claim of God. The Torah is concerned with every aspect of the believer's life, not just the so-called "religious" aspects.

While in the Western spiritual tradition we have tended to see the "religious" as separate from the "secular," the Hebrew mind has no such distinction. There is no purely "religious" existence separate from a relationship to the living God.

The Hebraic perspective draws a direct correlation from any and every aspect of life to the eternal purposes of God—this is the intrinsic logic of the Shema. Yahweh is Lord of all of life and not just the "religious zone"!

To say this more explicitly: there is no such thing as sacred and secular in biblical thinking. All of life must come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. All life belongs to God, and true worship involves bringing all of life under his rule. This is what it means to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

But we now need to consider how Jesus changes the equation.

## Jesus Is Lord

The incarnation does not alter the nature of God or the fundamental practical monotheism of the Scriptures. Rather, it reinforms and restructures monotheism around the central character in the New Testament: Jesus Christ. He becomes the focus of our monotheism. We now adhere to him—he not only initiates the new covenant; he is the New Covenant.

The early Christians proclaimed "Jesus is Lord" in the same way, and with exactly the same implications, that Israel proclaimed "Yahweh is Lord." The context had changed from those of Canaanite gods (Baal, Ashteroth, etc.) to Greco-Roman ones (Zeus, Apollo, etc.), and in our day to the gods of consumerism, ideologies, and self-help religion. But in essence the challenge remains the same.

This is precisely why the early Christians eventually had trouble with Rome. In the Roman Empire, the emperor was considered divine, and the confession "Caesar is Lord" was required of all citizens. It was the political genius of Rome to gather all the religions of the empire under the lordship of Caesar and so create a religion that lent a deeper religious unity to the state. As long as the people were willing to acknowledge that Caesar was lord over all, and that no other god was supreme, the people generally submitted.

The early church rejected this claim of the overlordship of Caesar. The confession "Jesus is Lord" became in their mouths and in this context a direct challenge to all other absolute claims to political lordship. The Christians wanted to bring all of life under the lordship of Jesus, not the lordship of Caesar. The emperors understood this all too clearly; hence the terrible persecutions.

The early Christians understood the inner meaning of monotheism here. They knew that Jesus is Lord means that no other authority can claim ultimate loyalty. They knew that this was the heart of the faith, and they could not, would not, compromise it—even to the point of death.

This situation turns out to be exactly the same for the contemporary Chinese underground church. They refused to acknowledge the claim of the communist state over their lives, a claim that would effectively displace the supreme lordship of Jesus. This was the source of spiritual conflict, and it remains so to this day.

In both cases, the people of God were willing to die rather than deny their essential affirmation. Herein lies the heart of Apostolic Genius.

## Jesus-Shaped Monotheism

So how has the New Testament revelation conditioned the biblical understanding of monotheism? The New Testament reveals that each person in the Trinity has a particular role in redemption. While there is a complex three-ness of sorts in the divine nature, the overall emphasis in the New Testament is on the absolute and ongoing centrality of Jesus for Christianity as a whole.

The early Christians did not move one iota from their primary commitment to the Shema and its practical monotheism. But they reinterpreted this monotheism as the ruling idea guiding the central confession of the people of God. This is clearest in Jesus' extensive use of the phrase "the kingdom of God" (kingdom = rule of God), so when Jesus says in Matthew 6:33, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well," he is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema.

The New Testament consistently calls us to bring all of life under the lordship of Jesus. The teaching about the Trinity takes on a distinct role in relation to redemption, not only by revealing the three persons of the Godhead but also by emphasizing Jesus' executive lordship at the right hand of the Father.

But the teaching about Jesus' executive lordship goes deeper than merely acknowledging his position. The New Testament reveals that the rule normally associated with the Father is now passed on to Jesus. As Paul says in Ephesians:

*He raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.* (Ephesians 1:20-23)

In 1 Corinthians 15:25-28, Paul says, "For he [Jesus] must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.... When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all."

This is what I call christocentric monotheism because it realigns our loyalties to God through Jesus. Jesus becomes the focal point in our relation to God, and it is to him that we must give our allegiance. This is the covenant claim of God over our lives in the New Testament, in the same way that it is in the Old Testament.

This is not just about the nature of God himself; it has practical implications for our lives. It means that every aspect of our existence must come under the rule of Jesus. There can be no compartmentalization, no separation between sacred and secular, no area of life that remains outside his lordship.

## The Messiah and Movement

I wish to briefly restate here what seems an obvious fact, but one that is often overlooked: Christianity is inextricably linked to the specific man Jesus who plays the absolutely defining role. Whatever else Christianity is, it is first and foremost a response to the historical and risen Jesus. In other words, there is no way around Jesus to get to God. Our relationship with God is inextricably linked to Jesus, the Second Person of the Trinity.

This is what makes Christianity unique. This is what makes it a movement. Jesus is the Messiah, and everything about him, his person, and his work—without exception—must define the movement that bears his name.

We should always expect a correspondence between the Founder and his followers. If the movement doesn't look and sound like the Founder, then something must be deeply wrong. A movement that seeks to authentically and consistently embody the life, spirituality, teachings, and mission of Jesus will be a movement that recovers the gospel in its utter simplicity.

Discipleship is becoming like Jesus our Lord and Founder. This is the heart of the church's task. It means that Christology must define all that we do and all that we are. We need to refocus our attention back to the Root of it all, to recalibrate ourselves around Jesus. It will mean taking the Gospels seriously as the primary texts that define us.

This is why I say that Christology determines missiology, and missiology determines ecclesiology. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right. We cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

And here's the extension I want to propose: **Christology begets movement**. Movement is the apostolic form that flows from who Jesus is and what he came to do. When Christology is right, when missiology flows from it, when ecclesiology takes its apostolic form, movement is not just possible—it's inevitable.

## Beyond the Sacred-Secular Divide

One of the most damaging effects of losing sight of "Jesus is Lord" as the center of all of life is what I call the sacred-secular divide. This is a false separation between the "sacred" and the "secular" that has infected much of Western Christianity.

Abraham Kuyper, the Dutch theologian and statesman, said it well: "There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'"

If all things come from him, through him, and for him, then there can be no non-God area in our lives and in our culture. When churches, whether they be fundamental or sacramental, seek to set up special "sacred spaces," they fall into this trap. By setting up a place that we call "sacred," what are we thereby saying about everything else?

By setting up so-called sacred spaces, we, by implication, make everything else "secular"—a non-God, non-sacred, area. Following the impulses of biblical monotheism, rather than setting up sacred spaces, we should seek to make all of life sacred—family, work, play, conflict, and so on—and not limit the presence of God to special buildings or special times.

People involved in dualistic spiritual paradigms experience God as a church-based deity and religion as a largely private affair. Church is conceived as a special sacred event, and the architecture, language, and culture all collaborate to make this a sacred event not experienced elsewhere. The problem is that this creates the erroneous perception that God is really encountered only in church, and that we need special paraphernalia to mediate this experience.

This is what I call the Sunday-Monday disconnect. We go to church on Sunday and experience God in a special way. But then Monday comes, and we say, "This is 'the real world,' and things work differently here." How many times have you heard someone say, "I'd love to live like that, but I have to work in the real world"? This is the sacred-secular divide in action.

In this view, the sacred and the secular are conceived as being infinitely different and heading in opposite directions. It is the actual way we do church that creates this disconnect, this false message. And it sets people up to see things in an essentially distorted way. The space that should be filled with God's presence is then filled by idols and false, or incomplete, worship.

When we refuse the false dualism of sacred or secular, and when we commit ourselves to bringing all of life under the lordship of Jesus, we end up with a very different picture. We see that God is present everywhere. We see that all of life is sacred. We see that there is no area of our lives that should not and cannot be brought under this rule of God.

Our task is to identify the various domains of our lives and bring them under the one God manifested to us in Jesus Christ. When we fail to do this, we end up as practicing polytheists. Dualistic expressions of faith always result in this. We end up with different gods for different spheres of our lives, and the God of the church in this view is largely impotent outside the sacred zone.

This is why movements that maintain the centrality of "Jesus is Lord" find themselves both persecuted and powerful. They're persecuted because they challenge the false authorities that claim lordship over different spheres of life. But they're powerful because they tap into the very source of life itself—the one true Lord who rules over all.

## How Far Is Too Far?

Perhaps we can finish this exploration by asking a practical question: How does this central force of spiritual mDNA actually guide our missional conduct and activities? As an incarnational missional practitioner, you might ask, "How far can I go in identifying with my culture? How far is too far?"

Those are good questions. How can we know the difference between syncretism (the blending of religions) and genuinely incarnational expressions of church?

I believe that the concept of christocentric monotheism provides the answer. If we maintain the lordship of Jesus and his exclusive claim over all aspects of our lives, then we have a clear standard by which to judge the difference between syncretism and genuinely incarnational expressions of church.

Syncretism is a religion that merely diminishes the tension of living under the claim of Jesus. Let me give you an example: apartheid in South Africa. The majority of white South Africans were professing Christians, and to a large extent they sanctioned the racial prejudice and legitimized the oppressive power structures through what they called "Christian paternalism."

This was syncretism, and not just political expedience, because the majority of white South Africans were a deeply religious people. But they had put race and politics out of the equation of the lordship of Jesus in their lives. In effect, they had co-opted God to their racist agenda. Paradoxically, the rest of the culture was more consistent—they simply rejected the God in the church.

We could analyze the Rwandan genocide in the same way—a murderous frenzy that involved active, professing Christians killing other active, professing Christians. This can be understood as a failure of professing Christians to live under the lordship of Christ.

In fact, the Rwandan genocide highlights a recurrent failure of much historic Christianity. The proclamation of the "gospel" has often failed to emphasize a central Christian doctrine: "Jesus is Lord" is a radical claim, one that is ultimately rooted in questions of allegiance, of ultimate authority, and of the nature of power as the standard for human life.

Instead, Christianity has often sought to ally itself comfortably with allegiance to other authorities, be they political, economic, cultural, or ethnic. Could it be that "Jesus is Lord" has become one of the most systematically set aside calls in all of Christianity? At least in Rwanda, being "Christian" apparently served as a brand name—a "spirituality," or a "religion"—but not as a call to radical obedience to the one true Lord.

## What This Means for Movement

What does all this practically mean for those seeking to recover Apostolic Genius? It means directly addressing the central confession of "Jesus is Lord" and attempting to reorient our lives around it. It means simplifying our core messages, uncluttering our overly complex theologies, and thoroughly evaluating the traditional templates that so profoundly shape our behaviors.

The key to reactivating movement DNA is Christology, and in particular the primitive, unencumbered Christology of the New Testament. This is the key that unlocks Apostolic Genius at all times and in every age.

We need to recover the centrality of Jesus in our experience of church. There is so much clutter in our theologies and practices that the simple confession that lies at the heart of the faith is easily lost. It is remarkable how Jesus can get pushed to the periphery of a movement that bears his name. In Revelation 3:20, Jesus is seen standing outside his church knocking at the door. The question we must ask is, "How did he get outside his people in the first place?"

We need to reJesus the church, to go back to the founding "formula" of the church. We need to center our lives on him. Christianity is essentially a "Jesus movement" and not a religion in the normal sense of the word. The absolute and ongoing centrality of Jesus for Christianity as a whole is what the early church discovered, what the Chinese underground church discovered, and what we need to discover as we seek to negotiate the challenge of the twenty-first century.

The lordship of Jesus in all of its utter simplicity is the place to which the persecuted church always returns. It is also the place to which we must return. Jesus is our defining Center, our Founder, and therefore he has preeminence theologically, missiologically, and ecclesiologically.

It is an arduous thing to truly worship the one God because it involves bringing every aspect of our lives under his rule. There can be no getting around it. And we don't need to look as far as Rwanda or apartheid South Africa to see the effects of avoiding Jesus' claims. We need only look at our own lives, our own churches, our own communities.

When we fail to let the claim of Jesus seep into all the dimensions of our lives and respond in obedience, we effectively limit the lordship of Jesus and his claim of absolute rule. When practicing the missional discipline of incarnation, we need to always ask: Does this align with the nature and character of Jesus? How far from this ideal is too far? I suggest that it is when we can no longer see Jesus in what we're doing—that simple.

"Jesus is Lord" is more than an mDNA element and a critical element of Apostolic Genius. The other elements of mDNA flow from this center. But at the heart of the church's call and mission lies a challenge to respond to God with wholehearted devotion, to bring all of life under the lordship of Jesus.

As Jesus himself asked, "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?" (Luke 6:46)

---

## Everything Flows from the Center

Here's what I want you to see: "Jesus is Lord" isn't just the first element. It's the element that gives meaning and coherence to all the others.

**Disciple-making flows from Jesus' lordship.** We become like the one we follow. We reproduce what we are. If Jesus is Lord, then we follow him, learn from him, become like him. Disciple-making is the natural response to recognizing Jesus as Lord.

**Mission flows from Jesus' lordship.** If Jesus is Lord, then we go where he went. We do what he did. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present. Mission is not an activity we choose to do; it's the result of recognizing that Jesus is Lord and following him into the world.

**APEST flows from Jesus' lordship.** Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher. The church is called to mirror this fivefold nature. When Jesus is Lord, all five forms of intelligence are activated and valued.

**Organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom Jesus announced.** Like seeds, like yeast, like a growing tree. They work with the grain of how life actually multiplies, not against it. When Jesus is Lord, our systems reflect the nature of his kingdom.

**Communitas reflects the nature of the community Jesus created.** Not a club for the comfortable, but a band of brothers and sisters sent together into mission. When Jesus is Lord, we experience the deep bonds of liminal community forged in shared adventure.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. This is the theological logic that undergirds everything.
