# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **What competing "lords" are claiming authority in your life?** In your community? What authorities are demanding ultimate allegiance?

2. **How would living as if "Jesus is Lord" actually change your priorities, decisions, practices?** What would be different? What would stay the same?

3. **What does it mean for Jesus' lordship to be "the heart of it all" rather than just one element?** How does this shift your understanding of movement DNA?

4. **Where do you see the sacred-secular divide operating in your context?** How has this created a "Sunday-Monday disconnect"? How might you challenge it?

5. **What areas of your life feel disconnected from God?** How might bringing them under Jesus' lordship change that? What would that look like practically?

6. **How does the Shema—"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"—speak to you?** What does it mean for Jesus to be the one Lord over every sphere of life?

7. **What would it look like to make "Jesus is Lord" the center of your community's identity and practice?** What would change? What obstacles stand in the way?

8. **How does "Jesus is Lord" connect to the other elements of movement DNA?** How does it give meaning and coherence to disciple-making, mission, APEST, organic systems, and communitas?
