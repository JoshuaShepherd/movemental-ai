# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify who is discipling you, who you are discipling, and what obstacles stand in the way of making disciple-making the center of your community's practice.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify: Who is discipling them? Who are they discipling? What would it look like to make disciple-making the center of their community's practice? What obstacles stand in the way?

**Sample Prompts:**
- Who is actively discipling you right now? Who are you actively discipling?
- How would your community change if disciple-making became the central practice?
- What obstacles (time, capacity, know-how, consumerism) stand in the way of disciple-making in your context?
- What would it look like to organize your community around mission rather than programs?
- How is consumerism affecting your ability to make disciples? What would countercultural discipleship look like?
