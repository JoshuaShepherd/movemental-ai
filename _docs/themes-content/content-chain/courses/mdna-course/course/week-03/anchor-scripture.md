# Anchor Scripture: The Great Commission

> "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."  
> —Matthew 28:18-20

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's probably familiar to you. You've likely heard it quoted countless times. But I want you to read it slowly, carefully, noticing what it actually says.

Read it once, focusing on the first phrase: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." What does it mean that Jesus has all authority? What does this have to do with disciple-making?

Read it again, this time focusing on the command: "Therefore go and make disciples." Notice what the command is. It's not "go and make converts." It's not "go and make church members." It's not "go and make consumers." It's "go and make disciples."

Read it a third time, noticing the sequence: "go and make disciples, baptizing them... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." What comes first? Disciple-making. Then baptism. Then teaching. The order matters.

Now read it one more time, focusing on the promise: "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." What does it mean that Jesus is with us in this task? What does this promise tell us about disciple-making?

Take a moment. Let this sink in. This is Jesus' final command to his followers. This is what he left them to do. Not to build buildings. Not to create institutions. Not to write books. To make disciples.
