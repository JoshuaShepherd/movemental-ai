# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that disciples who follow Jesus' lordship are sent into the world. This is the missional-incarnational impulse—the twin movements of going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational).

If Jesus is Lord, then we follow him into the world. We go where he went. We do what he did. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: disciple-making is not optional. It's not just for new converts. It's not something we move beyond. It's the journey itself. It's the essential practice. It's how movements multiply.

We become like the one we follow. We reproduce what we are. If we're not disciples, we can't make disciples. If we're not following Jesus, we can't invite others to follow.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we make disciples.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we make disciples.
