# Week 3: Disciple-Making—The Essential Practice

## What Jesus Actually Did

Let me ask you a question: What did Jesus actually do during his earthly ministry?

He didn't write books. He didn't build buildings. He didn't create institutions. He didn't even leave behind a detailed organizational structure or a comprehensive strategic plan.

What did he do? He made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was his foundational strategy. Everything else flowed from that.

Think about it. Jesus spent three years with twelve men. He lived with them. He traveled with them. He ate with them. He taught them. He showed them. He corrected them. He sent them out. He debriefed them. He modeled for them what it meant to follow God, to love people, to engage mission, to live in the kingdom.

And here's what's remarkable: when Jesus was gone, when he ascended to heaven, when he left them to carry on the work, they didn't have buildings or institutions or programs. But they had something else. They had been discipled. They had been formed. They had been equipped. They had been sent.

And that was enough. More than enough. Because disciples who have been discipled can make disciples. Disciples who have been formed can form others. Disciples who have been equipped can equip others. Disciples who have been sent can send others.

This is how the movement multiplied. Not through programs. Not through institutions. Not through buildings. Through disciples making disciples.

## The Journey, Not the First Step

Here's something I need you to understand: disciple-making is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move. It is the journey itself.

We never move beyond being disciples. We are always disciples in the making. We never graduate from discipleship. We never move on to something more important. Discipleship is not preparation for something else. Discipleship is the thing itself.

This is a critical distinction, because so much of our thinking about discipleship treats it as something we do with new converts, something we move beyond once we're "mature," something that's optional for the committed few.

But that's not how Jesus thought about it. That's not how the early church thought about it. That's not how any significant movement in history has thought about it.

For the follower of Jesus, discipleship must not be viewed as the first step on a journey toward some other destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way. Yet there seems to be a general assumption in the church that discipleship is something we do with new converts, but once we're mature, we move on to other things.

But here's the problem: when we look at significant missional movements, we discover how counterintuitive this assumption is. These movements never appear to get beyond disciple-making as a core practice. This is the practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact in and through movements.

Take the early church, for instance. They didn't have a discipleship program for new converts and then move them on to something else. Discipleship was the ongoing practice of the entire community. Everyone was a disciple. Everyone was being discipled. Everyone was making disciples.

Or take the Chinese underground church. They developed what they called the "catechumenate"—a rigorous process of discipleship that required proposed converts to prove they were worthy of joining the community. This was not a quick conversion process. This was a long-term, relational, transformative journey of becoming like Jesus.

Or take the Methodists. John Wesley organized his movement around "classes" and "bands"—small groups focused on discipleship. This wasn't an optional extra. This was the core practice. And when Methodism lost this focus, when discipleship became an optional extra, the movement declined.

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

## The Critical Reversal

But here's the critical insight, and I want you to hear this clearly: **discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around.**

The church growth movement reversed this order. It focused on event-based proclamation, altar calls, and conversion experiences rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences.

Think about it. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples." Evangelism happens naturally within that process. But when we make evangelism the primary focus, when we separate it from discipleship, we end up with a Christianity without discipleship.

And as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ.

When we reverse the order, when we make evangelism primary and discipleship secondary, we create a system that:
- Focuses on getting people to make a decision rather than following Jesus
- Emphasizes conversion events rather than transformation journeys
- Produces consumers rather than disciples
- Creates dependency rather than multiplication
- Measures success by numbers rather than depth

But when we get the order right, when we make discipleship primary and evangelism happens within that context, we create a system that:
- Focuses on following Jesus rather than just making a decision
- Emphasizes transformation journeys rather than conversion events
- Produces disciples rather than consumers
- Creates multiplication rather than dependency
- Measures success by depth rather than just numbers

This is what I call "disciplism"—reframing evangelism within the context of discipleship. The gospel is not just something we proclaim. It's something we embody. It's something we live. It's something we become.

And when we become the gospel, when we embody the message, when we live as disciples, evangelism happens naturally. Not as a separate activity, but as the overflow of a life that's been transformed by following Jesus.

## The Conspiracy of "Little Jesuses"

Here's what I want you to see: when Jesus tasked his people with the Great Commission, what did he have in mind? What was his strategy for reaching the world?

I believe his strategy was to get many "little Jesuses" infiltrating every nook and cranny of society, expressing the message and mission of Jesus through their very lives. Not just proclaiming the gospel, but being the gospel. Not just talking about Jesus, but being like Jesus.

This is what disciple-making is about. It's about becoming like Jesus. It's about embodying his message and mission. It's about expressing the gospel through our lives, not just our words.

The heart of discipleship is to become like Jesus. If we can get many little versions of him infiltrating every nook and cranny of society, expressing the message and mission of Jesus through their very lives, then we have a strategy that can reach the world.

But this issue goes much deeper than sociological models. It touches on the very purposes of Christ's mission among us. Jesus not only embodies God in our midst, but he also calls us to be conformed to his image. As Paul says, it is our eternal destiny to be conformed to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29).

This goes deeper still. Our mystical union with Christ and his indwelling with us means that we are called to express Christ through our lives. Paul's teaching about being "in Christ" and he in us, as well as John's theology of abiding in Christ, all point to one thing: Christlikeness.

We heed the words ascribed to Mother Teresa: "We are called to be contemplatives in the heart of the world, seeking the face of God in everything, everyone, everywhere, and at all times. Jesus wants to use us to love the world. He wants us to be his love, his compassion, and his presence. But we can only do this if we allow him to live his life fully in us."

One of the best ways of thinking about discipleship is that we are called to do the same things that Jesus did, for the same reasons that he did them. This is the heart of Christian spirituality and theology. We are constantly reminded that we are to be conformed to the image of Christ. This is one of the undisputed central tenets of both Jesus' teaching and that of the apostles.

## Embodiment and Transmission

Closely linked to the idea of the imitation of Christ is the idea of embodiment. When we look at the outstanding movements in history, we realize that they all succeeded in embodying the message of Jesus (redemption, atonement, forgiveness, love, etc.) into concrete life through the lives of their members.

Through this, the Jesus phenomenon became a movement of the people and not just a religion of the priests. This is what happens in the history of religions when movements become truly transformative.

Embodiment literally means to give flesh to the ideas and experiences that animate us. If these ideas and experiences are really believed in and valued, then they must be lived out. Embodiment is an important factor in the healthy transmission, credibility, and witness of the Christian movement and therefore to both discipleship and mission.

The gospel is never just communicated through writing and books; it is always communicated through life itself, by the leader and by the community. This is what authentic discipleship must seek to achieve.

Jim Wallis says that "the only way to propagate a message is to live it." In terms of missional strategy and how we impact people with the gospel, we must recognize that without embodiment, the message of Christ is an otherwise rather nebulous theory. This concept is therefore not just a nice idea but absolutely crucial both for the transmission of the gospel beyond ourselves and for the authenticity and vitality of the church's mission.

Listen to how Paul describes this in 1 Thessalonians:

*You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit. And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere.* (1 Thessalonians 1:6-9)

Notice what Paul is saying. The Thessalonians became imitators. They became a model. The message rang out from them. Their faith became known everywhere. This is embodiment. This is transmission. This is how the gospel spreads.

Or consider what Paul says in Philippians:

*Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.* (Philippians 3:17)

And in 1 Corinthians:

*Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.* (1 Corinthians 11:1)

Because the apostles were essentially the custodians of the DNA of God's people, the embodiment of the gospel had to be observed as a living aspect of their ministry. The correspondence between message and messenger that authenticated the apostolic message was crucial. People could be faithful because they had observed in Paul a living model of faithfulness. And this led to lasting impact.

The teachings must embed themselves in the lives of the leaders and take root in the lives of their followers. If they do not, the movement simply cannot reproduce. This is about patterning. The pattern of a movement is usually set in a definitive sense by the founder and the first generation. For the Christian church, this notion of modeling the message is absolutely critical to the ongoing transmission of the faith to subsequent generations.

## The Challenge of Consumerism

But here's the challenge we face: we live in a consumer culture that works against discipleship at every turn.

Consumerism is not just an economic system. It's a spiritual force. It's a false religion that competes with the lordship of Jesus for our ultimate allegiance. And it's one of the most significant threats to authentic discipleship in the Western world.

Think about it. Consumerism offers us:
- Identity through what we buy
- Purpose through what we consume
- Community through brand loyalty
- Transformation through purchasing power
- Salvation through acquisition

Sound familiar? These are the same things that religion offers. But consumerism offers them without the cost, without the commitment, without the transformation.

The problem for the church in this situation is that it is now forced to compete with products for the allegiance of people, and it must do this in a way that mirrors the way people make the countless daily choices in their lives. In the modern and the postmodern world, the church has become little more than a vendor of religious goods and services. And the end users of the church's services have become consumers, devouring the religious goods and services offered by the latest and best religious entrepreneurs.

The message, which was once designed to transform the hearts and minds of the hearers, now becomes mere entertainment that must compete with other forms of entertainment. The role of the church becomes similar to the role of the "feelies" in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where people go to experience feelings and sensations rather than transformation.

Church-growth exponents have explicitly taught us how to market and package the church. They've taken the principles of the shopping mall, applied it to the church, and created a one-stop religious shopping experience. They may have been well-intentioned, but they must also have been totally ignorant of the ramifications of what they were doing to the message.

When we make the church consumer-friendly, when we make it convenient and comfortable, when we remove the cost and the commitment, we're not making disciples. We're making consumers. And consumers don't multiply. They just consume more.

This is why Jesus said, "Do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things" (Matthew 6:31-32, emphasis mine). Consumerism is thoroughly pagan. Pagans run after these things. And when we run after these things, when we make them the center of our lives, we're not following Jesus. We're following the gods of consumerism.

The challenge is that consumerism impacts each and every one of us personally. We must find a way to deal with it if we are to recover authentic discipleship in the twenty-first century.

## Recovering Discipleship

So how do we recover authentic discipleship? How do we move from making consumers to making disciples?

I believe we need to initiate a thoroughly prophetic challenge to consumerism. We need to create countercultural expressions of church that challenge the consumerist assumptions of our culture. We need to develop what I call "new monasticism"—intentional communities that live by a different set of rules, that embody a different way of life, that demonstrate that there's an alternative to consumerism.

Some of the more effective, countercultural ways in which followers of Jesus can challenge consumerism are through the development of new monastic orders. For instance, the Mustard Seed Order is a missional church planting network built on the ideas of Count Zinzendorf. They combine a rule of life with local incarnational practices.

Another variation comes in the form of what has been called "new monasticism"—a movement that seeks to recover ancient practices of monasticism to challenge the worldliness of the church. These communities typically commit to:

1. Relocation to abandoned places of the city
2. Sharing economic resources with fellow community members and with the needy
3. Hospitality to the stranger
4. Lament for racial divisions in church and society, combined with an active pursuit of a just reconciliation
5. Humble submission to Christ's body, the church
6. Intentional formation in the way of Christ and the rule of community
7. Support for celibate singles alongside monogamous married couples and their children
8. Geographical proximity to community members who share a common rule of life
9. Care for God's earth and supporting local economies
10. Peacemaking in the midst of violence

These are critical points that can help us recover authentic discipleship. And there are groups like this flourishing in Western contexts—Shane Claiborne and Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove's communities, the Eden Project in Great Britain, Inner Change in the United States, and many others.

But we also need to recover the practice of disciple-making itself. We need to recognize that discipleship is not primarily about the transfer of information. It's about the transformation of life. It's about becoming like Jesus, not just knowing about Jesus.

## Action-Learning, Not Just Information

Here's what I've discovered: we cannot think our way into a new way of acting. We must act our way into a new way of thinking.

This is the difference between the academy and discipleship. The academy is concerned with the transfer of concepts and ideas. Discipleship is concerned with the transformation of life through action and reflection.

Most of our training institutions are geared toward preparing a more institutional type of leader. You can tell this by looking at the people teaching them. If we are going to learn from the movements that have activated Apostolic Genius, then we simply have to find "the better way" to form leaders.

The problem with the academy-based approach is that it removes the would-be leader from the context of ordinary life and places them in an academic setting for three to seven years. During that period, they are subjected to an intensive program of learning—theology, ethics, church history, pastoral theology, and so on. And while most of this is valuable, the student is also being shaped by the socialization processes that the seminary setting creates.

The student learns a language and thinking that are seldom understood and expressed outside the seminary. They take a flight into the wonderful world of abstraction, fly around for a few years, and then are expected to land again in the real world.

But here's the problem: you cannot think your way into a new way of acting. You must act your way into a new way of thinking.

This is why Jesus didn't establish an academy. He established a discipleship process. He took people with him. He lived with them. He showed them. He sent them out. He debriefed them. He corrected them. All in the context of real life, real mission, real ministry.

This is action-learning. This is discipleship. This is how transformation happens.

## Hitting the Road with Jesus

We are all familiar with the Gospel stories in which Jesus selects a band of followers and takes them on an adventurous journey of mission, ministry, and learning. Straightaway he sends them out to do the work—preaching, healing, and casting out demons. It was active and direct disciple-making in the context of mission.

The newest convert is engaged in the mission from the start; even he or she can participate in the work of the kingdom. If we are to take seriously the call to be the model of human holiness for the church, then we must say that discipleship is our primary task. And we must organize it around mission, because mission is the catalyzing principle of discipleship.

This is how Jesus did discipleship. He organized it around mission. He sent people out. He gave them real work to do. He let them make mistakes. He corrected them. He showed them. He modeled for them. All in the context of real life, real mission, real ministry.

This is what we need to recover. Not more information. Not more programs. Not more curriculum. But real discipleship in the context of real mission.

When people are placed in a situation requiring something beyond their current capacity, they are forced to learn. It's called jumping in at the deep end. Most of the learning happens through action, reflection, and correction. The intern meets at least weekly with a coach, who debriefs them, identifies problems, suggests actions, and refers them to resources, including books and conferences.

But this information is communicated only by those who have demonstrated competency in missional practice. We use missional practitioners to teach. Engaging in training in this way, the intern learns theology, but they learn it in the context of mission. Mission is, and always was, the mother of good theology.

## Connecting Back to Jesus' Lordship

But here's what I want you to see: disciple-making flows from recognizing that Jesus is Lord. We become like the one we follow. We reproduce what we are. If we're not disciples, we can't make disciples. If we're not following Jesus, we can't invite others to follow.

This is the connection between "Jesus is Lord" and disciple-making. When Jesus is Lord, we follow him. We learn from him. We become like him. And we invite others to do the same.

This is why disciple-making is not optional. This is why it's not just for new converts. This is why it's the essential practice. Because if Jesus is Lord, then following him is not optional. Becoming like him is not optional. Making disciples is not optional.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we make disciples. We make disciples because Jesus is Lord. We make disciples so that others can recognize that Jesus is Lord.

This is the theological logic. This is the missional logic. This is the movement logic.
