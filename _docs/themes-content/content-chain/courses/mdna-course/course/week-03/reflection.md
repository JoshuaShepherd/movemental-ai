# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **Who is actively discipling you right now?** Who are you actively discipling? What does your current discipleship practice look like?

2. **How would your community change if disciple-making became the central practice?** What would be different? What would stay the same?

3. **What obstacles stand in the way of disciple-making in your context?** Time? Capacity? Know-how? Consumerism? Something else?

4. **How is consumerism affecting your ability to make disciples?** In what ways has consumerism shaped your understanding of discipleship? What would countercultural discipleship look like?

5. **What does it mean that discipleship is the journey itself, not the first step?** How would this shift change your approach to discipleship?

6. **How does disciple-making connect to Jesus' lordship?** What does it mean that we become like the one we follow? How does this shape your understanding of discipleship?

7. **What would it look like to organize your community around mission rather than programs?** How would this enable disciple-making? What would need to change?

8. **How does the Great Commission speak to you?** What does it mean that the command is to "make disciples," not just "go" or "baptize" or "teach"? How does the order matter?
