# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where God is sending you, what contexts you're called to go deep into, and what it would look like to practice the missional-incarnational impulse in your specific context.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify: Where is God sending them? What contexts are they called to go deep into? What would it look like to practice presence, proximity, powerlessness in their specific context? How would their community change if it operated on a "sending" rather than "attractional" model?

**Sample Prompts:**
- Where is God sending you? What contexts are you called to go deep into?
- How would your community change if it operated on a "sending" rather than "attractional" model?
- What would it look like to practice the six incarnational practices in your specific context?
- What are the "nooks and crannies" in your community where mission could happen?
- How can you practice proximity, frequency, and spontaneity in your context?
- What would it look like to "romance the city" in your context?
- What obstacles stand in the way of missional-incarnational engagement?
