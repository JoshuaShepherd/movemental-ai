## Reading Practice: Reflective Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's short. Just eight words in English. But it contains everything we need to understand about mission.

Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the first phrase: "As the Father has sent me." How did the Father send Jesus? What did that look like? What did that mean?

Read it a third time, focusing on the second phrase: "I am sending you." What does it mean that Jesus is sending us? How are we sent? Where are we sent? What are we sent to do?

Now read it one more time, focusing on the connection: "As... so." Jesus is saying that our sending is like his sending. Our mission is like his mission. Our way is like his way.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. This is not just a command. This is an invitation. This is a commissioning. This is the pattern for how we engage the world.

If you want to go deeper, read Matthew 28:18-20 alongside this. Notice how the Great Commission flows from Jesus' authority and leads to disciple-making. Notice how mission and discipleship are connected. Notice how we're sent to make disciples, not just to make converts.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just mission strategy. Not just evangelism techniques. Not just church growth methods. We're exploring what it means to be sent as Jesus was sent. We're exploring what it means to go out and go deep. We're exploring what it means to become native to our context rather than remaining foreign.
