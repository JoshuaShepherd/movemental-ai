# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that missional-incarnational communities need all fivefold functions—APEST culture. When we go out and go deep, we need all five forms of intelligence working together. We need Apostles to pioneer, Prophets to discern, Evangelists to recruit, Shepherds to nurture, and Teachers to ground.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: the missional-incarnational impulse is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting.

We go out. We go deep. We become native to our context. We engage in the nooks and crannies. We practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we go out. We go deep. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we go out. We go deep. We become native to our context. We engage in the nooks and crannies. We participate in what God is already doing.
