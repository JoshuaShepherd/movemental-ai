# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **Where is God sending you?** What contexts are you called to go deep into? What are the "nooks and crannies" in your community where mission could happen?

2. **How would your community change if it operated on a "sending" rather than "attractional" model?** What would be different? What would stay the same? What obstacles stand in the way?

3. **What would it look like to practice the six incarnational practices in your specific context?** Which practices do you need to develop most? What would that look like practically?

4. **How can you practice proximity, frequency, and spontaneity in your context?** What would need to change? What would need to be let go?

5. **What would it look like to "romance the city" in your context?** How can you develop deep, loving relationships with the culture you're called to reach?

6. **How does the missional-incarnational impulse connect to Jesus' lordship?** What does it mean that we follow him into the world? How does this shape your understanding of mission?

7. **How does the missional-incarnational impulse connect to disciple-making?** What does it mean that disciples who follow Jesus are sent into the world?

8. **What does it mean that "church follows mission, not the other way around"?** How would this shift change your understanding of church? What would need to change?

9. **How does John 20:21—"As the Father has sent me, I am sending you"—speak to you?** What does it mean to be sent as Jesus was sent? How does this shape your understanding of mission?

10. **What's your next step?** What do you need to do to begin practicing the missional-incarnational impulse? What support do you need? What questions do you want to explore further?
