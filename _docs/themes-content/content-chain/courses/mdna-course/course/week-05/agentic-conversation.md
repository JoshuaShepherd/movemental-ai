# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify which APEST functions are active in your context, which are missing or suppressed, and what it would look like to create an APEST culture where all five forms of intelligence are valued and activated.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify: Which APEST functions are active in their context? Which are missing or suppressed? What would it look like to create an APEST culture where all five forms of intelligence are valued and activated? What is their APEST profile? How can they develop their calling?

**Sample Prompts:**
- Which APEST functions do you see most clearly in yourself? In your community?
- Which functions are missing or suppressed? What difference does that make?
- What would it look like to create an APEST culture where all five forms of intelligence are valued?
- What is your APEST profile? How can you discover and develop your calling?
- How does your community express the fivefold functions? What's present? What's missing?
- How can you avoid allowing any one function to dominate?
- How can you integrate all five functions in dynamic tension?
