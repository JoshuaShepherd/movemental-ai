# Anchor Scripture: The Fullness of Christ

> "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."  
> —Ephesians 4:11-13

## Reading Practice: Meditative Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's one of the most important texts in the New Testament for understanding how the church is meant to function. But I want you to read it slowly, meditatively, letting it sink in.

Read it once, focusing on the first phrase: "So Christ himself gave..." Notice who is doing the giving. It's not the church. It's not the apostles. It's Christ himself. These are gifts from Christ to his church.

Read it again, this time focusing on what Christ gave: "the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers." Notice there are five. Not one. Not two. Five. All of them. All necessary.

Read it a third time, focusing on the purpose: "to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up..." Notice the purpose is not to create a professional class. It's to equip all people. It's to activate the ministry of all believers.

Now read it one more time, focusing on the goal: "until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." Notice the goal: the fullness of Christ. Not partial. Not incomplete. Full. Complete. Whole.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. The church is meant to attain the fullness of Christ. And this fullness requires all five functions. Not some. Not most. All.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just leadership roles. Not just ministry functions. We're exploring five forms of intelligence that are meant to be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. We're exploring what it means to create APEST culture—an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued, activated, and working together.
