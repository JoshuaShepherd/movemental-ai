# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that APEST culture needs organic systems to enable movement rather than constrain it. When we have all five functions operating, we need systems that enable multiplication rather than constrain it. We need structures that are organized but not institutionalized.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: APEST is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting.

We need all five functions. Not some. Not most. All. Because they work together. They need each other. They create the fullness of Christ when they're all present and operating together.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we express all five functions. We create APEST culture. We attain the fullness of Christ.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we express all five functions. We create APEST culture. We attain the fullness of Christ.
