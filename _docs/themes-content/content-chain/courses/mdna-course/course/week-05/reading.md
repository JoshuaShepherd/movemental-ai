# Week 5: APEST Culture—The Fivefold Intelligence

## Not Just Roles, But Intelligence

Let me ask you a question: When you think about the church, when you think about ministry, when you think about leadership, what comes to mind?

For many of us, we think about pastors. Maybe teachers. Maybe evangelists if we're in certain traditions. But we tend to think of these as roles, as positions, as jobs that certain people have.

But here's what I want you to see: APEST is not just about roles or functions. It's about forms of intelligence. It's about ways of seeing, ways of thinking, ways of engaging that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ.

Think about it like this: Just as the human body has different systems—cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, respiratory—each with its own function, so the Body of Christ has different forms of intelligence—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching—each with its own function. And just as the human body needs all its systems to function properly, so the Body of Christ needs all five forms of intelligence to attain the fullness of Christ.

This is what I call **APEST culture**—not just APEST roles, but an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued, activated, and working together. It's about creating a culture where every believer can discover and develop their calling, where all five functions operate throughout the organization, where the fullness of Christ can be expressed.

And here's what's crucial: every believer carries elements of all five. You're not just one. You're not just an Apostle or just a Prophet. You have elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. This is your unique APEST profile—your identity and destiny in and by Jesus.

But the church needs all five functions operating simultaneously. You can't have movement with just Shepherd and Teacher. You can't have transformation with just Apostle and Prophet. You need all five, working together, creating something greater than the sum of their parts.

## The Five Forms of Intelligence

Let me introduce you to each of the five forms of intelligence. I want you to see them not as roles you might have, but as ways of thinking, ways of seeing, ways of engaging that are meant to be present throughout the Body.

**Apostle (A) — Pioneering Intelligence**

The apostolic function is about extending, multiplying, architecting, mobilizing. Apostles are the pioneers. They see what's not there yet. They imagine what could be. They extend the movement into new contexts. They multiply communities. They architect systems that enable movement. They mobilize people for mission.

Think about it: If you want missional movements, you must have apostolic ministry. The apostolic function is what enables the church to extend beyond its current boundaries, to multiply, to become a movement rather than just an institution.

But here's what's crucial: apostolic intelligence is not limited to a few special people. It's meant to be distributed throughout the Body. Every believer has some apostolic capacity. Every believer can extend, multiply, architect, mobilize in their own context.

**Prophet (P) — Discerning Intelligence**

The prophetic function is about challenging, calling to covenant faithfulness, exposing falsehood. Prophets are the discerners. They see what others miss. They challenge what needs to be challenged. They call people back to covenant faithfulness. They expose falsehood and injustice. They speak truth to power.

Think about it: The prophetic function is what enables the church to maintain its integrity, to stay faithful to its calling, to challenge the powers that be. Without the prophetic, the church becomes complacent, compromised, complicit.

But here's what's crucial: prophetic intelligence is not limited to a few special people. It's meant to be distributed throughout the Body. Every believer has some prophetic capacity. Every believer can challenge, discern, call to faithfulness in their own context.

**Evangelist (E) — Recruiting Intelligence**

The evangelistic function is about gathering, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause. Evangelists are the recruiters. They gather people. They proclaim the good news. They connect people to the cause. They make the message accessible. They bridge the gap between the church and the world.

Think about it: The evangelistic function is what enables the church to reach people, to gather them, to connect them to the cause. Without the evangelistic, the church becomes insular, disconnected, irrelevant.

But here's what's crucial: evangelistic intelligence is not limited to a few special people. It's meant to be distributed throughout the Body. Every believer has some evangelistic capacity. Every believer can gather, proclaim, connect in their own context.

**Shepherd (S) — Nurturing Intelligence**

The shepherding function is about caring, protecting, building community, creating belonging. Shepherds are the nurturers. They care for people. They protect the flock. They build community. They create belonging. They ensure that people are loved, known, cared for.

Think about it: The shepherding function is what enables the church to be a community, to care for one another, to create belonging. Without the shepherding, the church becomes cold, disconnected, unloving.

But here's what's crucial: shepherding intelligence is not limited to a few special people. It's meant to be distributed throughout the Body. Every believer has some shepherding capacity. Every believer can care, protect, build community in their own context.

**Teacher (T) — Grounding Intelligence**

The teaching function is about explaining, equipping, systematizing, preserving truth. Teachers are the grounders. They explain the truth. They equip people. They systematize knowledge. They preserve what's been learned. They ensure that the church knows what it believes and why.

Think about it: The teaching function is what enables the church to be grounded, to know the truth, to be equipped. Without the teaching, the church becomes shallow, ungrounded, vulnerable to false teaching.

But here's what's crucial: teaching intelligence is not limited to a few special people. It's meant to be distributed throughout the Body. Every believer has some teaching capacity. Every believer can explain, equip, preserve truth in their own context.

## The Exile of the APE Functions

But here's the problem: The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions. We've operated primarily with Shepherd and Teacher—what I call the "ST" model.

Think about it. When you think about church leadership, what comes to mind? Pastors and teachers. That's what we have. That's what we know. That's what we're comfortable with.

But here's what's crucial: the "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents. They're the ones that enable movement, that challenge the status quo, that reach beyond boundaries. The "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. They're the ones that maintain, that preserve, that care.

Both are needed. But when you only have ST, you get organizational equilibrium and stasis. You get maintenance without mission. You get stability without movement. You get a church that's incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement.

This is what has happened to the Western church. We've exiled the change agents. We've kept the maintainers. And we wonder why we're not moving, why we're not multiplying, why we're not transforming.

But here's what I want you to see: this exile is not permanent. It's not inevitable. It's not the way it has to be. The APE functions are still there. They're still available. They're still gifts from Christ to his church. We just need to recover them. We just need to reactivate them. We just need to create space for them to flourish.

## Why All Five Are Necessary

But why are all five necessary? Why can't we just have Shepherd and Teacher? Why do we need Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist?

Let me show you why.

Think about the human body. You have different systems—cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, respiratory. Each system has its own function. Each system is necessary. You can't live without your cardiovascular system. You can't live without your nervous system. You can't live without your digestive system. You can't live without your respiratory system. You need all of them.

The Body of Christ is the same way. You need all five functions. You can't have movement without the apostolic. You can't have integrity without the prophetic. You can't have reach without the evangelistic. You can't have community without the shepherding. You can't have grounding without the teaching.

But here's what's even more important: they work together. They need each other. They create something together that none of them can create alone.

The apostolic extends, but it needs the prophetic to keep it faithful. The prophetic challenges, but it needs the teaching to ground it in truth. The evangelistic gathers, but it needs the shepherding to care for what's gathered. The shepherding nurtures, but it needs the apostolic to extend beyond itself. The teaching grounds, but it needs the prophetic to keep it from becoming dead orthodoxy.

They work together. They need each other. They create the fullness of Christ when they're all present and operating together.

This is what Ephesians 4:13 means when it speaks of "attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." This fullness cannot be achieved with only some of the functions. All five are needed. All five are necessary. All five are gifts from Christ to his church.

---

## Jesus Embodies All Five

But here's what I want you to see: Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions. He is the Apostle—sent by the Father, extending the kingdom, multiplying disciples. He is the Prophet—challenging the powers, calling to faithfulness, exposing falsehood. He is the Evangelist—proclaiming good news, gathering people, connecting them to the cause. He is the Shepherd—caring for the flock, protecting them, creating belonging. He is the Teacher—explaining truth, equipping disciples, preserving what's been revealed.

Jesus is the fullness. Jesus is the complete expression of all five forms of intelligence. And the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature. We're called to be like Jesus. We're called to express all five functions. We're called to attain the fullness of Christ.

This is the theological logic: Christology determines missiology, missiology determines ecclesiology. If Jesus embodies all five functions, then mission requires all five functions, and the church must be structured to enable all five functions.

We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right. We cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do. And if Jesus embodies all five functions, then the church must express all five functions.

This is not optional. This is not negotiable. This is who Jesus is. This is who we're called to be. This is what the church is meant to express.

---

## Universal Archetypes

But here's something else I want you to see: APEST functions are not limited to Christian contexts. They appear as universal archetypes throughout human culture—in business, arts, politics, education, and every domain of human endeavor.

Think about it. In business, you have entrepreneurs (apostolic), visionaries (prophetic), marketers (evangelistic), managers (shepherding), and analysts (teaching). In the arts, you have innovators (apostolic), critics (prophetic), promoters (evangelistic), curators (shepherding), and scholars (teaching). In politics, you have reformers (apostolic), activists (prophetic), campaigners (evangelistic), administrators (shepherding), and policy experts (teaching).

These patterns appear everywhere because they reflect the imago Dei—the image of God in humanity. They reflect aspects of God's own being. They're not just Christian concepts. They're universal archetypes that appear throughout human culture.

This is why APEST is so powerful. It's not just a church thing. It's a human thing. It's a God thing. It's how God designed the world to work. It's how God designed us to function.

And this is why recovering APEST is so important. We're not just recovering a church structure. We're recovering something that's encoded in the very nature of reality. We're recovering something that reflects who God is and how God designed the world to work.

## The Marks of a True Church

But here's another way to think about it: APEST can serve as the "marks of a true church"—not the traditional institutional marks, but fivefold marks that enable us to assess whether a church is truly functioning as the Body of Christ.

**Apostolic Mark**: Is the church missional? Is it extending? Is it multiplying? Is it reaching beyond its boundaries?

**Prophetic Mark**: Is the church holy and just? Is it challenging the powers? Is it calling to faithfulness? Is it exposing falsehood?

**Evangelistic Mark**: Is the church proclaiming good news? Is it gathering people? Is it connecting them to the cause?

**Shepherding Mark**: Is the church a reconciled community? Is it caring for people? Is it creating belonging? Is it protecting the flock?

**Teaching Mark**: Is the church grounded in wisdom and truth? Is it explaining the truth? Is it equipping people? Is it preserving what's been learned?

These marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools. They enable us to assess organizational health. They help us identify what's present and what's missing. They guide us in developing strategies for holistic maturity.

If a church has all five marks, it's functioning as the Body of Christ. If it's missing some, it's incomplete. If it's missing the APE functions, it's incapable of movement and mission.

This is how we can know whether a church is truly functioning as the Body of Christ. Not by its size. Not by its programs. Not by its buildings. But by whether it expresses all five forms of intelligence. Whether it attains the fullness of Christ.

## Creating APEST Culture

But how do we actually create APEST culture? How do we recover the exiled functions? How do we create an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued, activated, and working together?

Let me give you some practical steps.

**First, recognize that APEST is not just about roles.** It's about forms of intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body. Every believer has elements of all five. Every believer has a calling. Every believer has a role to play.

**Second, discover your APEST profile.** Take an APEST assessment. Discover which functions are dominant in you. Discover your unique calling. Discover your identity and destiny in and by Jesus.

**Third, organize your community around fivefold ministry.** Don't just have a pastor and a teacher. Have all five functions represented in your leadership. Create space for all five to operate. Ensure that all five are present and working together.

**Fourth, develop ministry capacity through fivefold training.** Don't just train pastors and teachers. Train apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. Develop the capacity for all five functions to operate throughout your organization.

**Fifth, assess your organizational health using fivefold diagnostics.** Which functions are present? Which are missing? Which are weak? Which are strong? Use the fivefold framework to diagnose your organizational health and develop strategies for improvement.

**Sixth, avoid allowing any one function to dominate.** When one function dominates, it creates unhealthy bias. It disrupts the spiritual ecology of Jesus' body. Ensure that all five functions are present and operating in dynamic tension.

**Seventh, integrate all five functions.** True maturity arises from integration—a "symphony" of all five dimensions. Each function needs the others to make the whole work. Create environments where all five functions can work together in harmony.

**Eighth, distribute leadership throughout the organization.** Don't concentrate leadership at the top. Distribute it throughout. Activate the ministry of all believers. Move beyond the clergy-laity divide. Create a culture where all five functions operate throughout the organization.

**Ninth, use the fivefold framework for discipleship pathways.** Help people discover their calling. Help them develop their capacity. Help them find their place in the Body. Use APEST as a framework for discipleship and development.

**Tenth, connect everything back to Jesus.** Remember that Jesus embodies all five functions. Remember that we're called to be like Jesus. Remember that the fullness of Christ requires all five functions. Keep Jesus at the center of everything.

---

## The Dynamic Tension

But here's something important to understand: the five functions exist in dynamic tension. They're not always comfortable with each other. They push against each other. They challenge each other. And that's good. That's necessary. That's how they create the fullness of Christ.

Think about it. The apostolic wants to extend, but the shepherding wants to care for what's already there. The prophetic wants to challenge, but the teaching wants to preserve. The evangelistic wants to gather, but the prophetic wants to ensure integrity.

This tension is not a problem to be solved. It's a dynamic to be managed. It's how the Body stays healthy. It's how the church maintains both movement and stability, both challenge and care, both extension and grounding.

When one function dominates, the tension is lost. The Body becomes unbalanced. The church becomes unhealthy. But when all five functions are present and operating in dynamic tension, the Body is healthy. The church is functioning as it's meant to function.

This is why we need all five. Not just some. Not just most. All. Because they work together. They need each other. They create the fullness of Christ when they're all present and operating in dynamic tension.

## Historical Examples

Let me show you how this has worked in movements throughout history.

The early church had all five functions operating. The apostles extended the movement. The prophets challenged the powers. The evangelists gathered people. The shepherds cared for the flock. The teachers grounded them in truth. All five were present. All five were operating. And the movement multiplied.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe recovered the apostolic function. The Celtic monks practiced peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They extended the movement into new contexts. They multiplied communities. They became a movement.

The Methodists recovered the apostolic and prophetic functions. John Wesley was both an apostle and a prophet. He extended the movement. He challenged the status quo. He called people to faithfulness. And the movement multiplied.

The Pentecostals recovered the evangelistic and prophetic functions. They proclaimed the good news. They gathered people. They challenged the powers. And the movement multiplied.

The Chinese underground church recovered all five functions. They had apostles who extended the movement. They had prophets who challenged the powers. They had evangelists who gathered people. They had shepherds who cared for the flock. They had teachers who grounded them in truth. All five were present. All five were operating. And the movement multiplied.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain all five functions thrive. Movements that lose them decline. APEST is not optional. It's essential. It's encoded in the very nature of the church.

## The Challenge for Us

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained in the ST model. We've been taught that church leadership means pastors and teachers. We've been taught that ministry is for professionals. We've been taught that the APE functions are for the first century, not for today.

This is hard to unlearn. It's hard to shift from ST to APEST. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of what we know, what we're comfortable with, what we've been taught.

But here's what I want you to see: APEST is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

The APE functions are still gifts from Christ to his church. They're still available. They're still necessary. We just need to recover them. We just need to reactivate them. We just need to create space for them to flourish.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment when the ST model is showing its limits, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to recover them.

---

## Connecting Back to Jesus' Lordship

But here's what I want you to see: APEST culture flows from recognizing that Jesus is Lord. If Jesus is Lord, and if Jesus embodies all five functions, then the church must express all five functions. We must be like Jesus. We must mirror his fivefold nature.

This is the connection between "Jesus is Lord" and APEST. When Jesus is Lord, we follow him. We become like him. We express what he expresses. We mirror his fivefold nature.

This is also the connection between disciple-making and APEST. When we make disciples, we're making people who follow Jesus. And following Jesus means expressing all five functions. It means being apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching.

This is also the connection between missional-incarnational impulse and APEST. When we go out and go deep, we need all five functions. We need apostles to extend. We need prophets to challenge. We need evangelists to gather. We need shepherds to care. We need teachers to ground.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we express all five functions. We create APEST culture. We attain the fullness of Christ.

---

## The Ministry of All Believers

But here's one more thing I want you to see: APEST is not just for leaders. It's for all believers. It's about activating the ministry of all believers. It's about moving beyond the clergy-laity divide.

Think about Ephesians 4:11-13 again. The purpose of the fivefold gifts is "to equip his people for works of service." It's not to create a professional class. It's to equip all people. It's to activate the ministry of all believers.

Every believer has a calling. Every believer has a role to play. Every believer has elements of all five functions. Every believer is meant to extend Christ's ministry to the world.

This is the priesthood of all believers. This is the ministry of all believers. This is what APEST enables. It's not about creating a hierarchy. It's about distributing ministry. It's about activating the entire Body.

When we create APEST culture, we're not just creating better leadership. We're creating a culture where every believer can discover and develop their calling, where every believer can play their part, where every believer can extend Christ's ministry to the world.

This is how movements multiply. Not through professional leaders. Not through programs. Not through institutions. Through the ministry of all believers. Through every believer discovering and developing their calling. Through every believer playing their part.

---

## Your APEST Profile

But here's what I want you to do: discover your APEST profile. Take an assessment. Discover which functions are dominant in you. Discover your unique calling. Discover your identity and destiny in and by Jesus.

You're not just one thing. You're not just an Apostle or just a Prophet. You have elements of all five. You have a unique profile. You have a unique calling. You have a unique role to play in the Body.

And here's what's crucial: your calling is not just for you. It's for the Body. It's for the world. It's for extending Christ's ministry. It's for participating in what God is doing.

So discover your profile. Develop your capacity. Play your part. Extend Christ's ministry. Participate in the fullness of Christ.
