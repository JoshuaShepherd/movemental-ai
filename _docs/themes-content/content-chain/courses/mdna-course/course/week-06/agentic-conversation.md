# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify what systems in your context are organic (enabling multiplication) and what systems are institutional (constraining movement), and what it would look like to design simple, reproducible, distributed systems.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify: What systems in their context are organic (enabling multiplication)? What systems are institutional (constraining movement)? What would it look like to design simple, reproducible, distributed systems? How can they be "organized but not institutionalized"?

**Sample Prompts:**
- What systems in your context enable multiplication? What systems constrain it?
- What would it look like to design simple, reproducible, distributed systems?
- How can you be "organized but not institutionalized"?
- What would it look like to shift from mechanistic to organic thinking?
- How can you pass on DNA through relationships, stories, and practices?
- What would it look like to create networks rather than hierarchies?
- How can you enable multiplication rather than addition?
