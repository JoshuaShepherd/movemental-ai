# Anchor Scripture: The Growing Seed

> "He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.'"  
> —Mark 4:26-29

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this parable. It's one of Jesus' most profound teachings about how the kingdom of God actually works. But I want you to read it slowly, contemplatively, noticing what it's actually saying.

Read it once, focusing on the seed: "A man scatters seed on the ground." Notice what the man does. He scatters. He plants. But then what? Does he control the growth? Does he make it happen? Does he engineer it?

Read it again, this time focusing on the growth: "Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how." Notice what happens. The seed grows. It sprouts. It develops. But the man doesn't know how. He doesn't control it. He doesn't engineer it. It happens "all by itself."

Read it a third time, focusing on the process: "All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head." Notice the sequence. First the stalk. Then the head. Then the full kernel. It's a process. It's organic. It's natural. It follows the pattern built into the seed itself.

Now read it one more time, focusing on the harvest: "As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come." Notice when the man acts. Not during the growth. Not during the process. Only when it's ripe. Only when the harvest has come.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. The kingdom of God grows organically. It follows patterns built into creation itself. It doesn't need to be engineered. It doesn't need to be controlled. It just needs the right conditions, and it grows.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just organizational theory. Not just management principles. We're exploring how movements organize themselves as living organisms rather than machines. We're exploring what it means to create organic systems—structures that enable multiplication rather than constrain it.
