# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to explore what it means that organic systems create the conditions for communitas—liminal community forged in shared adventure. When we organize organically, when we go out and go deep together, when we face shared challenges and risks, communitas emerges.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: organic systems are not something we create or import. They're something we remember and reactivate. They're already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But they're there, waiting.

We create systems that enable multiplication. We build structures that support reproduction. We organize in ways that work with the grain of how life actually multiplies.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we organize organically. We create systems that enable multiplication. We trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we organize organically. We create systems that enable multiplication. We participate in what God is already doing.
