# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you have experienced communitas, what conditions created it, and what it would look like to create liminal spaces and shared adventure in your context.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify: Where have they experienced communitas? What conditions created it? What would it look like to create liminal spaces, shared adventure, common mission in their context? How does communitas differ from normal community, and why does that matter for movement?
