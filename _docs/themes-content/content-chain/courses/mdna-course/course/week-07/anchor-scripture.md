# Anchor Scripture: The Early Church

> "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."  
> —Acts 2:42-47

## Reading Practice: Immersive Reading

Before we dive into the content, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's one of the most beautiful descriptions of Christian community in the New Testament. But I want you to read it slowly, immersively, noticing what kind of community is being described.

Read it once, focusing on what they devoted themselves to: "the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." Notice what they're doing. They're learning together. They're sharing life together. They're eating together. They're praying together. This is not just casual friendship. This is deep commitment.

Read it again, this time focusing on what they had: "All the believers were together and had everything in common." Notice the phrase "everything in common." This is not just sharing resources. This is radical sharing. This is deep togetherness. This is what happens when people are truly "in it together."

Read it a third time, focusing on the result: "And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." Notice what's happening. The community is growing. People are being added. Daily. This is not just a nice community. This is a multiplying community. This is a movement.

Now read Acts 4:32-35 alongside this: "All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them."

Notice the phrases: "one in heart and mind," "shared everything," "great power," "God's grace was so powerfully at work." This is not normal community. This is something deeper. This is something more.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. This is not just community. This is communitas. This is liminal community. This is community forged in shared adventure, in common mission, in the experience of being "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just community. Not just fellowship. We're exploring communitas—the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences, when they face challenges together, when they engage in shared mission and adventure.
