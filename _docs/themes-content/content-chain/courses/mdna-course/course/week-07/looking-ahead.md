# Looking Ahead

In the next chapter, we're going to bring it all together. We're going to explore what happens when all six elements work together—when Jesus is Lord gives meaning to disciple-making, which flows into missional-incarnational impulse, which requires APEST culture, which needs organic systems, which creates communitas. This is Apostolic Genius—not the sum of the parts, but the emergent property that appears when the system activates.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: communitas is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting.

We create liminal spaces. We engage in shared adventure. We form communitas. We become a band of brothers and sisters sent together into mission.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we go together. We become communitas. We form liminal community. We participate in what God is already doing.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from this center: **Jesus is Lord**. Therefore, we go together. We become communitas. We form liminal community. We participate in what God is already doing.
