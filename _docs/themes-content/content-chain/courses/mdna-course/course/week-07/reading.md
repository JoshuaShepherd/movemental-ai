# Week 7: Communitas—Liminal Community

## Not Just Community

Let me ask you a question: When you think about community, what comes to mind?

For many of us, community means belonging. It means comfort. It means stability. It means being with people like us. It means shared interests. It means programs and activities that bring us together.

But here's what I want you to see: there's a profound difference between community and communitas. And understanding this distinction is essential for grasping how movements form and thrive.

**Regular community** (what I call "communion") is about belonging, comfort, stability. It forms around shared interests, similarity, familiarity. It asks, "How can this serve me?" It's maintained through programs and activities. It's focused on insiders. It's about huddling and cuddling.

**Communitas** (liminal community) is about shared mission, risk, adventure, transformation. It forms around shared purpose, challenge, mission. It asks, "What can we accomplish together?" It's maintained through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself. It's focused on mission. It's about going out and going deep together.

Think about it. Regular community is the settled experience of a group focused on insiders. Communitas is the journey of a group that finds each other around a mission that lies beyond itself.

Regular community is comfortable. Communitas is challenging. Regular community is safe. Communitas is risky. Regular community is stable. Communitas is liminal. Regular community is about maintaining. Communitas is about transforming.

And here's what's crucial: movements require communitas. They can't function with just regular community. They need the deep bonds that form when people face challenges together. They need the comradeship that emerges from shared adventure. They need the togetherness that comes from being "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

## What Is Communitas?

But what exactly is communitas? Let me give you a definition.

Communitas is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences—those threshold moments when we find ourselves in transition, outside normal structures, facing risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough.

It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

The term comes from the anthropological work of Victor Turner, who studied rites of passage among African people groups. He observed that when people are driven to find one another through a common experience of ordeal, humbling, transition, and marginalization, they develop intense feelings of social togetherness and belonging. This sense of comradeship forged in testing conditions is what Turner called communitas.

Think about it. When people go through something difficult together—when they face a challenge, when they take a risk, when they engage in shared adventure—something happens. Normal social barriers break down. Class distinctions fade. Status differences disappear. People become equals. They become comrades. They become "in it together."

This is communitas. It's not something we create through programs. It's not something we engineer through activities. It's something that emerges when people share liminal experiences, when they face challenges together, when they engage in shared mission and adventure.

## Liminality and Communitas

But here's what I want you to see: communitas and liminality are inextricably linked. You cannot have communitas without liminality, and liminality naturally creates the conditions for communitas to form.

Liminality refers to threshold experiences—those times when people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society, a place that could involve significant danger and disorientation.

Think about it. Liminality is the space between the old and the new. It's the threshold between what was and what will be. It's the place where old certainties break down and new possibilities emerge. It's the edge of adventure, where mission and community intersect.

When people are in liminal space—when they're in transition, when they're outside normal structures, when they're facing uncertainty and risk—they're forced to rely on each other. They're forced to work together. They're forced to become "in it together." And in that process, communitas emerges.

This is why movements require liminality. They can't function in settled, comfortable spaces. They need the edge. They need the threshold. They need the space between the old and the new. They need the adventure that creates communitas.

## The Conditions for Communitas

But what conditions create communitas? When does it emerge? When do people experience that deep sense of comradeship and togetherness?

I believe communitas emerges when people are:

**In Liminal Space** — Between the old and the new, in transition, outside normal structures. When people are in liminal space, they're forced to rely on each other. They're forced to work together. They're forced to become "in it together."

**Facing Shared Challenges or Risks** — When people face challenges together, when they take risks together, when they engage in shared adventure, communitas emerges. The challenge creates the conditions. The risk creates the bonds. The adventure creates the comradeship.

**Committed to a Common Mission** — When people are committed to a common mission, when they're working toward a shared purpose, when they're engaged in something beyond themselves, communitas emerges. The mission creates the focus. The purpose creates the unity. The shared endeavor creates the togetherness.

**Dependent on Each Other for Survival or Success** — When people are dependent on each other, when they need each other, when they can't succeed alone, communitas emerges. The dependency creates the bonds. The need creates the connection. The mutual reliance creates the comradeship.

These are the conditions. These are when communitas emerges. These are what create the deep bonds that enable movements to form and thrive.

## Biblical Examples

But here's what I want you to see: communitas and liminality are thoroughly biblical. When we examine Scripture with the liminality-communitas framework in mind, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the most theologically fertile sections are formed in times of precisely such situations.

Take Abram (later Abraham), who with his entire extended family is called by God to leave house and home to undertake a very risky journey to an unknown land. The experiences they have along the way—stories that have shaped all subsequent faith—are not safe little bedtime stories. Rather they call us to a dangerous form of faithfulness that echoes the faithfulness of Abraham.

The exodus experience is profoundly liminal. This very tricky journey permanently shaped the people of God and continues to do so to this day. It was also the context of the substantial revelation of God in his covenant with his people. The same can be said of the exile into Babylon centuries later—this was an extreme situation that changed the whole way Israel related to its God.

The prophets spoke the Word of God into contexts of extremity. It was precisely when the people of God settled down and "forgot YHWH" that they had to be spiritually disturbed once again by the prophets. To awaken the people to their lost calling, the prophets recalled the dangerous memories about fires on the mountain and pursuing armies and a God who lovingly redeems a people and enters into a sacred and eternal covenant with them.

When we consider the lives and ministries of Samuel, Elijah, Samson, and David and his band, we come up with the consistent themes of liminality and communitas. And when we come to the New Testament, we need only to look to the life of Jesus. He had nowhere to lay his head, and he discipled his followers on the road in the dangerous conditions of an occupied land, against a hostile religious elite.

The book of Acts is so filled with communitas and liminality that it reads like a rollicking adventure story. Paul describes his experience vividly in 2 Corinthians: whippings, beatings, imprisonment, and shipwrecks can hardly be called safe, secure, comfortable, and convenient. Yet through these experiences, he and his apostolic band totally realign the course of history around the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The book of Hebrews is particularly significant for understanding communitas. It calls us to be God's pilgrim people who will faithfully testify, by their continuing status as exiles and strangers, to their desire for a better country, a heavenly city, a homeland. By their very pilgrimage, they give witness that they are in fact already citizens of that community. Hebrews pictures the Christian community on earth as living like Abraham in tents "in the land of promise, as in a foreign land."

This is the biblical pattern. This is how God's people are meant to live. Not in settled comfort. Not in safe stability. But in liminal space. In shared adventure. In communitas.

## Historical Examples

Let me show you how this has worked in movements throughout history.

The early church experienced communitas through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. Stripped of buildings, resources, and external support, they were forced to rediscover the "uncluttered simplicity" of the gospel, centering entirely on the lordship of Jesus and forming deep bonds through shared ordeal. They were in liminal space. They faced shared challenges. They were committed to a common mission. They were dependent on each other. And communitas emerged.

The Chinese underground church, which grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under intense persecution, is a powerful example of communitas. Forced into liminal spaces by persecution, they developed a deep sense of comradeship forged in testing conditions. This communitas enabled them to thrive and multiply even in the most hostile environments.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe maintained a commitment to liminality and communitas. The Celtic monks were known for their peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They left their homeland, their security, and their comfort to engage in dangerous mission, and in doing so they formed deep communitas that enabled them to transform entire cultures.

The Moravians, who sent out more missionaries in the first twenty years of their movement than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years, were characterized by communitas. Their commitment to dangerous mission created liminal experiences that forged deep bonds of comradeship.

The Methodists went out into the fields and the factories. They engaged in dangerous mission. They faced shared challenges. They were committed to a common purpose. And communitas emerged.

The Pentecostals went out into the streets and the neighborhoods. They engaged in risky mission. They faced opposition. They were dependent on each other. And communitas emerged.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain communitas thrive. Movements that lose it decline. Communitas is not optional. It's essential. It's encoded in the very nature of the church.

## Both Result and Catalyst

But here's what I want you to see: communitas is both a result of movement and a catalyst for movement.

Communitas is a result of movement because it emerges when people are sent together. When we go out and go deep together, when we engage in shared mission and adventure, when we face challenges together, communitas emerges. It's the natural result of being "in it together" in liminal space.

But communitas is also a catalyst for movement because it creates the deep bonds that enable multiplication. When people experience communitas, when they form deep bonds of comradeship, when they become "in it together," they're able to do things they couldn't do alone. They're able to take risks. They're able to face challenges. They're able to multiply.

Think about it. The early church experienced communitas because they were sent together. But that communitas also enabled them to multiply. The deep bonds they formed enabled them to face persecution. The comradeship they developed enabled them to spread the gospel. The togetherness they experienced enabled them to become a movement.

This is the cycle. Movement creates communitas. Communitas enables movement. They feed each other. They need each other. They create each other.

## The Loss of Communitas

But here's the problem: most Western churches have lost communitas. They've replaced it with community focused on comfort, safety, and serving insiders.

This loss is not intentional. It happens gradually. As churches grow, as they become more established, as they prioritize stability over mission, comfort over challenge, safety over adventure, they lose the liminal edge. They replace communitas with consumeristic community.

Think about it. Middle-class culture, with its focus on security, consumption, and risk-aversion, functions as an "anti-missional virus" that gradually erodes the liminal edge and replaces communitas with consumeristic community. The result is a church that "huddles and cuddles" rather than one that forms itself around a common mission that calls it to a dangerous journey.

When churches prioritize safety and comfort, when they avoid risk and adventure, when they "huddle and cuddle" rather than engage in shared mission, they lose the liminal edge. They lose communitas. And they lose the transformative power of movements.

But here's what I want you to see: communitas is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of comfort and safety. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

## Creating Communitas

But how do we actually create communitas? How do we recover what we've lost? How do we create the conditions for liminal community to emerge?

Let me give you some practical steps.

**First, recognize that communitas requires liminality.** You cannot have communitas without liminal experiences. You need to create spaces where people are in transition, where they're outside normal structures, where they're facing risk and uncertainty.

**Second, organize around mission, not ministry.** Gordon Cosby observed that in over sixty years of ministry, he had never seen a group that came together around a nonmissional purpose ever end up becoming missional. It was only those groups that set out to be missional that actually got around to doing it. This means organizing the church's life around mission (our role outside of the church), not ministry (our relationships with one another).

**Third, develop transformative vision.** Cultivating a vigorous transformative vision can create liminality and communitas. Holding a definite sense of vision and mission informs and alters how people think and behave in the present. When we are caught up in a vision and pursue it, we are changed, and we go on to enact history. This is "managing from the future"—establishing a compelling goal that draws the organization out of its comfort zone.

**Fourth, engage in shared endeavors.** Communitas forms when people engage in shared endeavors—working shoulder-to-shoulder on meaningful projects that require cooperation and mutual reliance. This might involve joint community projects, engaging in mission together, or participating in adventure activities that create liminal experiences.

**Fifth, put adventure back into the venture.** Communitas involves adventure, risk, and experimentation. Churches must overcome their desire to "huddle and cuddle" and instead form around a common mission that calls them out of their burrow and into a risky adventure. This requires courage, commitment, integrity, and hard work.

**Sixth, position the church within the hub of life.** Don't separate the church from life. Position it within the hub of life, where people already are, where challenges already exist, where mission already happens. This creates natural liminal experiences. This creates natural communitas.

**Seventh, create regular opportunities for shared adventure and risk.** Don't just have programs. Have adventures. Don't just have activities. Have challenges. Don't just have meetings. Have missions. Create regular opportunities for people to engage in shared adventure and risk.

**Eighth, develop a hero system that values adventure and mission.** Don't just celebrate attendance and programs. Celebrate mission and adventure. Don't just honor those who serve inside. Honor those who go out and go deep. Create a culture that values communitas.

**Ninth, ritualize liminality-communitas experiences into church culture.** Make liminal experiences part of your regular rhythm. Make shared adventure part of your normal practice. Make communitas part of your culture.

**Tenth, create mentor systems that transfer communitas from generation to generation.** Don't just pass on information. Pass on communitas. Don't just teach about mission. Engage in mission together. Create systems that transfer the experience of communitas from one generation to the next.

## The Edge of Adventure

But here's what I want you to see: communitas is about the edge of adventure. It's about where mission and community intersect. It's about the liminal space where transformation happens.

Think about it. When people engage in shared adventure, when they take risks together, when they face challenges together, something happens. Normal social barriers break down. Class distinctions fade. Status differences disappear. People become equals. They become comrades. They become "in it together."

This is the edge of adventure. This is where mission and community intersect. This is where communitas emerges. This is where movements form.

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained to avoid the edge. We've been taught to seek safety. We've been taught to avoid risk. We've been taught to stay in our comfort zones.

But here's what I want you to see: the edge is where life happens. The edge is where transformation happens. The edge is where communitas emerges. The edge is where movements form.

If we want communitas, we need to go to the edge. We need to engage in shared adventure. We need to take risks together. We need to face challenges together. We need to be "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

## Connecting Back to Jesus' Lordship

But here's what I want you to see: communitas reflects the nature of the kingdom community Jesus created.

When Jesus is Lord, and when we follow him into the world, we don't go alone. We go together. We become a band of brothers and sisters sent together into mission. We become a communitas of exiles and strangers, living in liminal spaces that create the conditions for deep community to form.

This is the connection between "Jesus is Lord" and communitas. When Jesus is Lord, we follow him. We go where he went. We do what he did. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present. And we do it together. We become communitas.

This is also the connection between disciple-making and communitas. When we make disciples, we're making people who follow Jesus together. We're creating communitas. We're forming liminal community.

This is also the connection between missional-incarnational impulse and communitas. When we go out and go deep together, when we engage in shared mission and adventure, communitas emerges. It's the natural result of being "in it together" in liminal space.

This is also the connection between organic systems and communitas. When we organize organically, when we create systems that enable multiplication, we create the conditions for communitas to emerge. Organic systems create the space for liminal community.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center. Jesus is Lord. Therefore, we go together. We become communitas. We form liminal community. We participate in what God is already doing.

## The Challenge for Us

But here's the challenge: most of us have been trained to avoid liminality. We've been taught to seek safety. We've been taught to avoid risk. We've been taught to stay in our comfort zones.

This is hard to unlearn. It's hard to shift from safety to adventure. It's hard to move from comfort to challenge. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of what we know, what we're comfortable with, what we've been taught.

But here's what I want you to see: communitas is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. It's already there, encoded in the very nature of the church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of comfort and safety. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment when comfort is showing its limits, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to reactivate it.

So here's my invitation to you: Come with me on this journey. Whether you're new to these ideas or coming back for metanoia, whether you're discovering or remembering, whether you're a beginner or someone who's been wrestling with these questions for years.

Come and rediscover communitas. Come and remember what we've forgotten. Come and reactivate what's been suppressed.

Come and create liminal spaces. Come and engage in shared adventure. Come and form communitas. Come and participate in what God is already doing.
