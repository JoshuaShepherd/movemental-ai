# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you create an action plan for reactivating movement DNA in your context.*

**Focus:** Helps participants create an action plan: Which element of mDNA needs the most attention in their context? What would it look like to begin reactivating movement DNA? What support do they need? What's their next step? How will they remember what they've forgotten?

**Sample Prompts:**
- Which element of mDNA needs the most attention in your context right now?
- What would it look like to begin reactivating movement DNA where you are?
- What support do you need? What's your next step?
- How will you remember what you've forgotten?
- What would it look like to create an action plan for reactivating movement DNA?
- How can you find support and community for this journey?
- What resources do you need to go deeper?
