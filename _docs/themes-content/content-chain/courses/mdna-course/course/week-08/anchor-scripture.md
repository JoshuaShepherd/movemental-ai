## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we bring this journey to a close, I want to invite you to spend some time with this passage. It's from the end of the book of Revelation, from a vision of the new heaven and the new earth. But I want you to read it slowly, contemplatively, noticing what it's actually saying.

Read it once, focusing on who is speaking: "He who was seated on the throne said..." Notice who is doing the speaking. It's not us. It's not the church. It's God. The one seated on the throne. The one who is making everything new.

Read it again, this time focusing on what is being said: "I am making everything new!" Notice the verb. It's present tense. It's active. It's ongoing. God is making everything new. Not "I will make." Not "I made." But "I am making." Right now. In this moment. Always.

Read it a third time, focusing on the scope: "everything new." Notice what's being made new. Not some things. Not most things. Everything. All of it. The whole creation. The whole cosmos. Everything.

Now read it in context. Read Revelation 21:1-5: "Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.' He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new!'"

Notice the vision. A new heaven and a new earth. A new Jerusalem. God dwelling with his people. No more death. No more mourning. No more crying. No more pain. The old order has passed away. Everything is being made new.

Take a moment. Let this sink in. God is making everything new. Right now. In this moment. Always. And this includes the church. This includes movement. This includes you.

This is what we've been exploring together. Not just movement DNA. Not just church strategy. We've been exploring what it means to participate in what God is already doing—making everything new. We've been exploring what it means to remember what we've forgotten. We've been exploring what it means to reactivate what's been suppressed.
