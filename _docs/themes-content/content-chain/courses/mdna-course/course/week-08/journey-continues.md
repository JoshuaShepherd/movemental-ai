# The Journey Continues

This is not the end. This is the beginning.

You've completed this primer. You've explored the six elements. You've discovered Apostolic Genius. You've begun to remember what you've forgotten.

But the journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

There are deeper resources to explore. There are other books to read. There are communities to join. There are practices to develop. There are movements to participate in.

This primer is just the beginning. It's an entry point. It's a foundation. It's a starting place.

But the journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

So keep going. Keep exploring. Keep remembering. Keep reactivating. Keep participating in what God is already doing.

The seed is already planted. The DNA is already encoded. The potential is already present.

Remember what you've forgotten. Reactivate what's been suppressed. Participate in what God is already doing.

Everything flows from the center. Everything returns to the center.

**Jesus is Lord.**

Everything. Always. Forever.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

Go in peace. Go in power. Go in the name of the one who is making everything new.
