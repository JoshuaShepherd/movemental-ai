# mDNA Primer: Rediscovering the Movement DNA Within
## Book Proposal and Comprehensive Outline

---

## Vision Statement

This is a moment. A moment in the world when everything seems to be shifting, when old certainties are crumbling, when the church finds itself in a new kind of exile—not from buildings or programs, but from the cultural center it once occupied. And this is also a moment for me—a moment when, for the first time, I'm making my content available online, in new forms, in ways that might reach people I've never met, in contexts I've never imagined.

People often tell me my work is hard to understand. Or hard to know what to do with. I get that. I've spent decades wrestling with complex systems, theological frameworks, movement dynamics. I've written books that assume you've read other books, that build on concepts introduced elsewhere, that speak to people already deep in the missional conversation.

But here's the thing: the movement DNA I've been exploring—what I call mDNA—isn't actually complicated. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried under layers of institutional thinking. But it's there. It's in every believer. It's in every expression of church. It's latent, waiting to be reactivated.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment of new forms, new platforms, new ways of connecting—is exactly the right moment to go back to the beginning. To write a primer. Or maybe a re-primer. Something that welcomes both those who are just discovering these ideas and those who are coming back for metanoia—for that deep rethinking, that remembering, that re-stuff that happens when you realize you've been thinking about things the wrong way.

This book is that primer. It's an invitation to rediscover the movement DNA that's already within you, already within your community, already encoded in the very nature of the church. It's not about adding something new. It's about remembering what we've forgotten. It's about reactivating what's been suppressed. It's about coming home to the movemental nature of the church.

---

## Core Proposition

**Movement DNA (mDNA) is not something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate.** Every genuine expression of the church carries within it the six essential elements that, when working together, generate what I call Apostolic Genius—that mysterious, powerful, movemental energy that transforms communities into world-changing movements.

This book is designed to help you:
- **Discover** the six elements of mDNA if you're new to these ideas
- **Rediscover** them if you've heard them before but need to go deeper
- **Remember** what you've forgotten if you've been operating in institutional modes
- **Reactivate** the movement DNA that's been suppressed in your context

Each chapter will take you deeper into one element, but always in relation to the whole—because mDNA is systemic. The elements don't work in isolation. They work together, creating something greater than the sum of their parts.

And throughout it all, we'll keep coming back to the center: **Jesus is Lord**. Not as one element among six, but as the foundation that gives meaning and coherence to everything else. Christology determines missiology, missiology determines ecclesiology, and ecclesiology in its apostolic form is movement. This is the theological logic that undergirds everything.

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** 
- Leaders and practitioners who are new to missional thinking and movement DNA
- Those who've heard about mDNA but need a clear, accessible introduction
- People coming back to these ideas for "metanoia"—deep rethinking and remembering
- Communities looking to reactivate movement DNA that's been suppressed

**Secondary:**
- Experienced missional leaders who want a refresher or a resource to share with others
- Church planters and movement catalysts who need foundational understanding
- Anyone wrestling with the gap between what the church is and what it could be

This book assumes **no prior knowledge** of my other works, though it will naturally connect to them. It's designed to stand alone while also serving as an entry point to deeper exploration.

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **Accessible Entry Point**: Written as a primer, not assuming prior knowledge of missional frameworks
2. **Welcome to Metanoia**: Acknowledges those coming back for deep rethinking, not just beginners
3. **Moment-Aware**: Connects to this specific moment in history and in my own journey
4. **Action-Oriented**: Each chapter includes anchor scripture, reading, agentic conversation, and reflection
5. **Christology-Centered**: Every element connects back to "Jesus is Lord" as the foundation
6. **Systemic Understanding**: While exploring each element, maintains awareness of the whole system

---

## Estimated Length

- Main text: 40,000–50,000 words
- Each chapter: 5,000–6,000 words
- Total: 40,000–50,000 words (designed for 8-week course format)

## Book Structure & Comprehensive Outline

### **Chapter 1: Introduction—This Moment, This DNA**

**Anchor Scripture:** Romans 11:36 — "For from him and through him and for him are all things."

**Reading Practice:** Lectio Divina with Romans 11:36, focusing on the "from him" as source, "through him" as means, "for him" as purpose.

**Core Content:**

This chapter opens by acknowledging the moment we're in—both globally (cultural shifts, church in exile, adaptive challenges) and personally (new forms of content delivery, online platforms, reaching new audiences). I'll be honest: people say my work is hard to understand. That's partly because I've been writing for people already in the conversation. But maybe this moment—this moment of new forms—is exactly when we need to go back to the beginning.

I'll introduce the central question: How do you account for movements that grow exponentially without the resources we assume are necessary? The early church. The Chinese underground church. The Methodists. The Pentecostals. What did they have that we've forgotten?

The answer, I believe, is movement DNA—mDNA. Six essential elements that, when working together, generate Apostolic Genius. But here's the crucial thing: mDNA isn't something we create or import. It's already there. It's in every believer. It's in every expression of church. It's been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But it's there, waiting to be reactivated.

This book is an invitation to rediscover that DNA. Whether you're new to these ideas or coming back for metanoia—for that deep rethinking and remembering—this is for you. We're going to explore each of the six elements, but always in relation to the whole, always coming back to the center: Jesus is Lord.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:** 
Helps participants identify where they are in their journey—new discovery or metanoia moment? What questions are they bringing? What movement DNA might already be active (or suppressed) in their context?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What brought you to this moment? What questions are you carrying?
- Where do you see movement DNA already active in your context? Where is it suppressed?
- What would it mean for you to "remember" rather than "learn" movement DNA?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** Sets up the foundation—Jesus is Lord—as the center from which all else flows.

---

### **Chapter 2: Jesus Is Lord—The Heart of It All**

**Anchor Scripture:** Deuteronomy 6:4-5 (The Shema) and 1 Corinthians 8:6 — "For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live."

**Reading Practice:** Meditative reading of the Shema, considering what it means for Jesus to be the one Lord over every sphere of life.

**Core Content:**

This is not just one element among six. This is the foundation. The center. The heart. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems. What remains is this: **Jesus is Lord**.

I'll explore how this confession represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema. It's not just a theological proposition—it's a reality that eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority. Caesar? No. Consumerism? No. Nationalism? No. Success? No. Jesus is Lord. Full stop.

This confession is inherently political, inherently revolutionary, inherently missional. It demands total allegiance. It reshapes every dimension of life. It challenges the powers. It subverts the status quo. It calls forth a community that lives as if this confession is actually true.

I'll show how movements that maintain this centrality find themselves both persecuted and powerful—persecuted because they challenge false authorities, powerful because they tap into the very source of life itself. And I'll explore how this confession connects to the theological logic: Christology determines missiology, missiology determines ecclesiology, and ecclesiology in its apostolic form is movement.

But here's what I want you to see: "Jesus is Lord" isn't just the first element. It's the element that gives meaning and coherence to all the others. Disciple-making flows from Jesus' lordship. Mission flows from Jesus' lordship. APEST flows from Jesus' lordship. Everything flows from this center.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify competing "lords" in their lives and contexts. What authorities are claiming ultimate allegiance? How would living as if "Jesus is Lord" actually change things? What would it look like to make this confession the center of their community?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What competing "lords" are claiming authority in your life? In your community?
- How would living as if "Jesus is Lord" actually change your priorities, decisions, practices?
- What does it mean for Jesus' lordship to be "the heart of it all" rather than just one element?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** Jesus' lordship calls us to become like him—disciples who make disciples.

---

### **Chapter 3: Disciple-Making—The Essential Practice**

**Anchor Scripture:** Matthew 28:18-20 — "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations..."

**Reading Practice:** Contemplative reading of the Great Commission, noticing that the command is to "make disciples," not just "go" or "baptize" or "teach."

**Core Content:**

Jesus didn't write books. He didn't build buildings. He didn't create institutions. He made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was his foundational strategy. Everything else flowed from that.

I'll explore how disciple-making is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move. It is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making. Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice.

But here's the critical insight: discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences.

I'll show how every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

And I'll connect this back to Jesus' lordship: disciple-making flows from recognizing that Jesus is Lord. We become like the one we follow. We reproduce what we are. If we're not disciples, we can't make disciples. If we're not following Jesus, we can't invite others to follow.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify: Who is discipling them? Who are they discipling? What would it look like to make disciple-making the center of their community's practice? What obstacles stand in the way?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Who is actively discipling you right now? Who are you actively discipling?
- How would your community change if disciple-making became the central practice?
- What obstacles (time, capacity, know-how) stand in the way of disciple-making in your context?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** Disciples who follow Jesus' lordship are sent into the world—missional-incarnational impulse.

---

### **Chapter 4: Missional-Incarnational Impulse—Going Out and Going Deep**

**Anchor Scripture:** John 20:21 — "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."

**Reading Practice:** Reflective reading of the sending passages (John 20:21, Matthew 28:18-20), considering what it means to be "sent" as Jesus was sent.

**Core Content:**

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

I'll explore the missional impulse—the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people. This is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

Then I'll explore the incarnational impulse—the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

I'll introduce the six practices of incarnational mission: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, and Proclamation. These practices enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

And I'll connect this back to Jesus' lordship: if Jesus is Lord, then we follow him into the world. We go where he went. We do what he did. We become like him—sent, incarnate, present.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify: Where is God sending them? What contexts are they called to go deep into? What would it look like to practice presence, proximity, powerlessness in their specific context?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Where is God sending you? What contexts are you called to go deep into?
- How would your community change if it operated on a "sending" rather than "attractional" model?
- What would it look like to practice the six incarnational practices in your specific context?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** Missional-incarnational communities need all fivefold functions—APEST culture.

---

### **Chapter 5: APEST Culture—The Fivefold Intelligence**

**Anchor Scripture:** Ephesians 4:11-13 — "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

**Reading Practice:** Meditative reading of Ephesians 4:11-13, considering what "the fullness of Christ" means and why all five functions are necessary.

**Core Content:**

APEST represents the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11. But it's not just about roles or functions—it's about forms of intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ."

I'll introduce each function:
- **Apostle (A)**: Pioneering intelligence—extending, multiplying, architecting, mobilizing
- **Prophet (P)**: Discerning intelligence—challenging, calling to covenant faithfulness, exposing falsehood
- **Evangelist (E)**: Recruiting intelligence—gathering, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause
- **Shepherd (S)**: Nurturing intelligence—caring, protecting, building community, creating belonging
- **Teacher (T)**: Grounding intelligence—explaining, equipping, systematizing, preserving truth

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement.

I'll show how APEST culture—not just APEST roles—is essential for movement. It's about creating an environment where all five forms of intelligence are valued, activated, and working together. And I'll connect this back to Jesus' lordship: Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions, and the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify: Which APEST functions are active in their context? Which are missing or suppressed? What would it look like to create an APEST culture where all five forms of intelligence are valued and activated?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which APEST functions do you see most clearly in yourself? In your community?
- Which functions are missing or suppressed? What difference does that make?
- What would it look like to create an APEST culture where all five forms of intelligence are valued?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** APEST culture needs organic systems to enable movement rather than constrain it.

---

### **Chapter 6: Organic Systems—Movemental Structures**

**Anchor Scripture:** Mark 4:26-29 — The parable of the growing seed: "Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how."

**Reading Practice:** Contemplative reading of seed and growth parables, considering the difference between organic growth and mechanical construction.

**Core Content:**

Movements require a different kind of structure than institutions. They need organic systems—living, breathing, reproducing structures that enable multiplication rather than constrain it. The difference is like the difference between a starfish and a spider: cut off a spider's head and it dies; cut a starfish in half and you get two starfish.

I'll explore how organic systems are:
- **Reproducible**: Each part contains the potential of the whole
- **Distributed**: No single point of failure, no central control
- **Adaptive**: They respond to context while maintaining DNA
- **Simple**: They operate on simple rules that enable complex emergence
- **Fractal**: Patterns repeat at every scale

I'll contrast this with institutional systems that rely on:
- Centralized control
- Hierarchical authority
- Program replication
- Resource accumulation
- Professional management

The challenge is to create systems that are organized but not institutionalized—that provide necessary structure without killing movemental energy. I'll explore how simple rules, distributed leadership, and reproducible practices enable organic multiplication.

And I'll connect this back to Jesus' lordship: organic systems reflect the nature of the kingdom Jesus announced—like seeds, like yeast, like a growing tree. They work with the grain of how life actually multiplies, not against it.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify: What systems in their context are organic (enabling multiplication)? What systems are institutional (constraining movement)? What would it look like to design simple, reproducible, distributed systems?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What systems in your context enable multiplication? What systems constrain it?
- What would it look like to design simple, reproducible, distributed systems?
- How can you be "organized but not institutionalized"?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** Organic systems create the conditions for communitas—liminal community forged in shared adventure.

---

### **Chapter 7: Communitas—Liminal Community**

**Anchor Scripture:** Acts 2:42-47 — "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer... All the believers were together and had everything in common."

**Reading Practice:** Immersive reading of Acts 2:42-47 and Acts 4:32-35, considering what kind of community is being described and what conditions create it.

**Core Content:**

Communitas is not just community. It's liminal community—community forged in the liminal space between the old and the new, in shared adventure and risk, in the experience of being "in it together" in ways that break down normal social barriers.

I'll explore how communitas differs from normal community:
- **Normal community** (communion) is about belonging, comfort, stability
- **Communitas** (liminal community) is about shared mission, risk, adventure, transformation

Communitas emerges when people are:
- In liminal space (between the old and new)
- Facing shared challenges or risks
- Committed to a common mission
- Dependent on each other for survival or success

I'll show how movements throughout history have been characterized by communitas—the early church, the Chinese underground church, the Methodists, the Pentecostals. They weren't just communities. They were communities forged in liminality, in shared adventure, in the experience of being sent together into mission.

I'll explore how communitas is both a result of movement (it emerges when people are sent together) and a catalyst for movement (it creates the deep bonds that enable multiplication). And I'll show how it connects to the missional-incarnational impulse: when you go out and go deep together, communitas emerges.

And I'll connect this back to Jesus' lordship: communitas reflects the nature of the kingdom community Jesus created—not a club for the comfortable, but a band of brothers and sisters sent together into mission.

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants identify: Where have they experienced communitas? What conditions created it? What would it look like to create liminal spaces, shared adventure, common mission in their context?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Where have you experienced communitas? What conditions created it?
- What would it look like to create liminal spaces and shared adventure in your context?
- How does communitas differ from normal community, and why does that matter for movement?

**Connection to Next Chapter:** When all six elements work together, Apostolic Genius emerges—the conclusion and sending.

---

### **Chapter 8: Closing—Remembering and Reactivating**

**Anchor Scripture:** Revelation 21:5 — "He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new!'"

**Reading Practice:** Contemplative reading of Revelation 21:1-5, considering what "making everything new" means and how it connects to remembering what we've forgotten.

**Core Content:**

This final chapter brings it all together. I'll remind readers that mDNA isn't something we create or import. It's something we remember and reactivate. The six elements are already there—in every believer, in every expression of church. They've been suppressed, forgotten, buried. But they're there, waiting.

I'll explore what happens when all six elements work together—when Jesus is Lord gives meaning to disciple-making, which flows into missional-incarnational impulse, which requires APEST culture, which needs organic systems, which creates communitas. This is Apostolic Genius—not the sum of the parts, but the emergent property that appears when the system activates.

I'll address the reality that reactivating mDNA isn't easy. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of institutional thinking, consumer patterns, attractional models. It requires courage, risk, adventure.

But I'll also remind readers that the future lies in the womb of the present. The seed is already there. The DNA is already encoded. The potential for movement already exists. We don't need to create something new. We need to remember what we've forgotten. We need to reactivate what's been suppressed.

I'll end with a sending—not just a conclusion, but a commissioning. You've rediscovered the movement DNA. Now what? How will you reactivate it in your context? How will you remember what you've forgotten? How will you participate in what God is already doing?

**Agentic Conversation Focus:**
Helps participants create an action plan: Which element of mDNA needs the most attention in their context? What would it look like to begin reactivating movement DNA? What support do they need? What's their next step?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which element of mDNA needs the most attention in your context right now?
- What would it look like to begin reactivating movement DNA where you are?
- What support do you need? What's your next step?
- How will you remember what you've forgotten?

**Connection to Ongoing Journey:** This is not the end but the beginning. The book points to deeper resources, community, continued learning.

## Conclusion

This mDNA Primer is designed for this moment—a moment when new forms are needed, when accessibility matters, when both beginners and those in metanoia need a way in. It's not about adding something new. It's about remembering what we've forgotten. It's about reactivating what's been suppressed. It's about coming home to the movemental nature of the church.

The six elements of mDNA are already there. They're in every believer. They're in every expression of church. They're waiting to be remembered, reactivated, released. This book is an invitation to that journey.

And it all starts—and ends—with this: **Jesus is Lord**. Everything else flows from there.
