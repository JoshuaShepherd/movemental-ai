## Course Philosophy & Alignment

### Core mDNA Principles

**1. Jesus is Lord: The Organizing Center**
- All six elements flow from and return to Jesus' lordship
- Lordship gates overall maturity (no Level 5 if Lordship < Level 3)
- Identity (indicative) precedes obedience (imperative)

**2. Systemic Interdependence**
- All six elements are necessary; weakest link constrains the whole
- Geometric mean calculation reflects system health
- Limiting factor identification guides formation focus

**3. Multiplication Focus**
- Reproducibility is the test of maturity
- Level 4+ requires second-generation fruit
- Simple, transferable practices over complex programs

**4. Lived Reality Over Knowledge**
- Assessment measures embodiment, not just beliefs
- Practices must be observable and verifiable
- Stories reveal maturity more than statements

### Course Design Principles

**1. Formation Over Information**
- Content serves practice, not vice versa
- Every lesson includes field experiments
- Action-learning loops (Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal)

**2. Level-Appropriate Challenge**
- Practices calibrated to current maturity level
- Next level visible but not required
- Previous level acknowledged as foundation

**3. Lordship Integration**
- Jesus is Lord opens, integrates, and closes each week
- All practices framed through lordship lens
- Decisions evaluated through lordship

**4. Spirit-Dependent Formation**
- Design creates conditions for growth
- Trust Spirit to form what we cannot manufacture
- Humility about level advancement goals

**Week 5**: "How does lordship shape our organizational structures?"
**Week 6**: "How does lordship hold the system together?"
**Week 7**: "How has lordship deepened through this journey?"

### Lordship Gate Reminder

Throughout the course, remind participants:
- "Remember: Jesus is Lord gates overall maturity"
- "No Level 5 overall if Lordship is below Level 3"
- "If your Lordship score is low, prioritize it first"
- "All elements flow from and return to lordship"

## Level-Adaptive Content Strategy

### Content Architecture

**Base Layer** (All users see):
- Core teaching (900-1200 words)
- Visualization (mDNA system)
- Scripture anchors
- Cohort session structure
- Jesus is Lord integration

**Level-Specific Layer** (Progressive disclosure):
- Practices by level (Level 1-2, Level 3, Level 4-5)
- Field experiments by level
- Reflection prompts by level
- Resources by level

### Level Calibration

**Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)**:
- **Tone**: Encouraging, foundational
- **Pace**: Slower, more support
- **Practices**: Simple, low-risk, high-structure
- **Support**: Extra coaching, simplified experiments
- **Goal**: Awaken to mDNA, establish foundational practices

**Level 3 (Integrating)**:
- **Tone**: Standard, balanced
- **Pace**: Moderate, self-directed
- **Practices**: Moderate complexity, balanced attention
- **Support**: Standard curriculum, peer learning
- **Goal**: Integrate practices, begin multiplication

**Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)**:
- **Tone**: Advanced, challenging
- **Pace**: Faster, independent
- **Practices**: Complex, multiplication-focused
- **Support**: Advanced curriculum, peer mentoring
- **Goal**: Refine practices, multiply equippers

### Practice Design Principles

**1. Level-Appropriate Challenge**
- Practices calibrated to current level
- Next level visible but not required
- Previous level acknowledged as foundation

**2. Observable Indicators**
- Practices must produce observable evidence
- Evidence collection required
- Stories over statements

**3. Reproducibility**
- Practices must be simple enough to reproduce
- Documentation required
- Transferability tested

**4. Lordship Integration**
- All practices framed through lordship
- Decisions evaluated through lordship
- Relationships shaped by lordship

## Progressive Disclosure Implementation

### UI Design Pattern

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Level: 2  │  Next Level: 3  │  Advanced: 4-5 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│ Practice for Your Level (Level 2):              │
│ → [Practice content - HIGHLIGHTED]             │
│                                                 │
│ Practice for Next Level (Level 3):             │
│ → [Practice content - VISIBLE, marked          │
│    "For Level 3"]                               │
│                                                 │
│ Advanced Practice (Level 4-5):                  │
│ → [Practice content - VISIBLE, marked          │
│    "For Level 4-5"]                              │
│                                                 │

## Assessment Integration

### Three Assessment Points

**Week 0: Baseline Assessment**
- Purpose: Establish starting point
- Content: Full 30-question assessment
- Output: Element scores, overall level, limiting factor
- Use: Pathway assignment, goal setting

**Week 6: Mid-Course Assessment**
- Purpose: Measure progress, adjust focus
- Content: Full 30-question assessment
- Output: Progress comparison, new limiting factor (if changed)
- Use: Adjust practices, intensify limiting factor focus

**Week 7: Final Assessment**
- Purpose: Measure advancement, celebrate growth
- Content: Full 30-question assessment
- Output: Final comparison, level advancement measurement
- Use: Celebration, ongoing pathway design

### Assessment-Driven Personalization

**Pathway Assignment** (Week 0):
- Based on overall maturity level
- Track 1 (L1-2): Dormant-to-Awakening
- Track 2 (L3): Integrating
- Track 3 (L4-5): Reproducing-to-Movemental

**Practice Selection** (Each week):
- Based on element-specific level
- Level 1-2 practices for Level 1-2 elements
- Level 3 practices for Level 3 elements
- Level 4-5 practices for Level 4-5 elements

**Limiting Factor Focus** (Week 6):
- Identify lowest-scoring element
- Design 2-week intensive
- Measure progress

### Level Advancement Measurement

**Element-Level Advancement**:
- Compare Week 0 to Week 7 scores
- Measure point improvement
- Map to level advancement
- Celebrate growth

**Overall Advancement**:
- Compare overall maturity levels
- Measure geometric mean improvement
- Apply lordship gate
- Celebrate system health

**Success Criteria**:
- **Primary**: Advance one level in limiting factor
- **Secondary**: Advance one level in 3+ elements
- **Tertiary**: Advance overall maturity level
- **Ultimate**: Observable indicators of growth
