## Course Design Features

### 1. Jesus is Lord Integration

Each week follows this pattern:
- **Opening (5 min)**: "How does [Element] flow from Jesus' lordship?"
- **Integration (throughout)**: Practices framed through lordship lens
- **Closing (5 min)**: "What does [Element] reveal about Jesus' lordship?"

### 2. Level-Adaptive Content

Each week provides practices for:
- **Level 1-2**: Dormant-to-Awakening (simple, foundational)
- **Level 3**: Integrating (standard, balanced)
- **Level 4-5**: Reproducing-to-Movemental (advanced, multiplication-focused)

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

All levels see all content, but:
- Current level practices are highlighted
- Next level practices are visible but marked "For Level [X]"
- Previous level practices are acknowledged as foundation
- Advanced level practices are visible for inspiration

### 4. Assessment Integration

Three assessment points:
- **Week 1**: Baseline assessment (integrated into introduction)
- **Week 8**: Mid-course assessment
- **Week 9**: Final assessment

### 5. Action-Learning Loop

Each week includes:
- **Explore**: Discussion and discovery
- **Evaluate**: Critical reflection
- **Employ**: Practical application
- **Journal**: Personal engagement
