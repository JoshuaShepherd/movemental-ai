# Week 1: Introduction

**Theme**: "Beginning the Journey: Understanding Where You Are and Where You're Going"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with interactive assessment review and maturity model exploration

---

## Big Idea

We begin where you are. Your assessment results tell a story—of where you are right now, not where you should be. The mDNA framework gives us a map for the journey ahead. The maturity model helps us understand the path. Jesus is Lord is the destination toward which we're all moving. This week, we meet you where you are, help you understand the map, and prepare you to take your first steps toward the center.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand your current location on the maturity journey
- Name the six elements of mDNA and see how they work together
- Interpret your assessment results through the lens of growth
- Identify your limiting factor and see it as an invitation
- Begin orienting toward Jesus as the organizing center of all formation

## Opening: Where You Are Is Where We Begin (10 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." —Matthew 11:28-29

> "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing." —John 15:5

### Teaching Content

Friends, welcome. We begin where you are.

This is a journey you're beginning. Every journey begins with knowing where you are.

Your assessment results are a map. They show you where you are right now. They reveal strengths to celebrate. They surface growth edges to address. They identify a limiting factor to strengthen. They are an invitation.

The mDNA framework gives us six elements that together form the genetic code of Jesus movements. These elements work as a system. They depend on each other. They strengthen each other. When one element is weak, it constrains the whole. When all elements cohere, movement happens.

Jesus is Lord is the organizing center. All six elements flow from this center. All formation moves toward this center. All maturity demonstrates this center. When we orient our lives around Jesus' lordship, everything else finds its place.

This week, we're going to walk through your assessment results together. We're going to explore the maturity model. We're going to introduce the six elements. We're going to help you understand where you are and where you're going. And we're going to begin orienting toward Jesus as the center of it all.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Before we look at your scores, before we identify your limiting factor, pause. Ask yourself: What brought me here? What am I hoping to learn? What would it mean for Jesus to be the organizing center of my life? Where am I right now, and where am I being invited to go?

### Prayer of Invitation

Lord Jesus, you meet us where we are. You don't wait for us to be perfect. You invite us to come as we are. As we begin this journey, help us see where we are with honesty and hope. Help us understand the map. Help us orient toward you as our center. Amen.

## Main Content: Understanding the Map (30 minutes)

### The Maturity Model: A Journey, Not a Destination

The maturity model is a journey you take. It's about growing deeper.

Think of it like a river. You're somewhere on that river. You might be at the source, just beginning. You might be in the middle, flowing steadily. You might be further downstream, moving with momentum. You're on the river. You're moving. You're growing.

The maturity model has five levels:

**Level 1: Dormant** - The seed is present, but not yet awakened. Practices are inconsistent. Formation is beginning.

**Level 2: Awakening** - The seed is sprouting. Practices are emerging. Formation is happening.

**Level 3: Integrating** - Patterns are forming. Practices are consistent. Formation is deepening.

**Level 4: Reproducing** - Multiplication is happening. Practices are being passed on. Formation is extending.

**Level 5: Movemental** - Movement is visible. Practices are multiplying. Formation is spreading.

Where are you? Look at your assessment results. Each element has a level. Your overall maturity is calculated from all six elements. This is a location. This is where you are on the journey.

### The Six Elements: A Living System

The mDNA framework identifies six essential elements that together form the engine-room of Jesus movements. These are a living system. They work together. They depend on each other.

**1. Jesus is Lord** - The organizing center. This element gates all others. When Jesus is truly Lord, everything else finds its place. When Jesus is not Lord, everything else becomes distorted.

**2. Disciple Making** - The strategic nerve. Movements multiply because discipleship is the core process. When disciples make disciples who make disciples, movement happens.

**3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Sent-and-embedded. As the Father sent the Son, so we are sent. We go into the world. We embed in contexts. We become present among people who don't yet know Jesus.

**4. Apostolic Environment (APEST)** - Fivefold ecosystem. Jesus gave gifts to the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. These are functions given to all believers for the equipping and expansion of the body.

**5. Organic Systems** - Movemental organization. Simple, reproducible patterns. Authority and function push to the edges. Feedback loops foster learning. The macro exists in the micro.

**6. Liminality-Communitas** - Risk-forged community. Communitas forms in shared ordeal for God's mission. When we step into liminal space together, deep bonds form. Adversity forges depth and agility.

These six elements work together. Strengthen one, and you help the whole. Ignore one, and you constrain the whole. They are systemic. They are interdependent. They are alive.

### Your Assessment Results: A Story of Growth

Your assessment results tell a story. They show you where you are strong. They show you where you're growing. They show you where you need attention.

Look at your scores. Which element scored highest? That's a strength. That's where Jesus' lordship is already shaping your life. Celebrate that.

Which element scored lowest? That's your limiting factor. That's the element that constrains your whole system. That's where growth will have the greatest impact.

Your limiting factor is an invitation. It's an opportunity. It's where Jesus is inviting you to grow.

The strategy for growth is to address the limiting factor first. Strengthen the weakest element, and you help the whole system. Ignore the limiting factor, and growth stalls.

We address the limiting factor under Jesus' lordship. We yield. We submit. We align. We practice obedience.

### The Lordship Gate: Why Jesus is Lord Matters Most

"Jesus is Lord" gates all other elements.

No overall Level 5 classification is possible if "Jesus is Lord" is below Level 3. This reflects the theological reality that all maturity flows from the confession that Jesus is King.

If "Jesus is Lord" is your limiting factor, you must address it first. You cannot achieve high overall maturity without a lived center in Jesus. All other growth depends on this foundation.

The lordship gate also means that even if "Jesus is Lord" is not your limiting factor, if it is below Level 3, it will cap your overall maturity. You might have high maturity in other elements, but without lordship as the foundation, the whole structure is unstable.

We always begin with lordship. We always return to lordship. Lordship is the center from which everything else flows.

### Orienting Toward the Center

This week, we're helping you orient toward Jesus as the center. We're not asking you to have it all figured out. We're not requiring you to be at a certain level. We're inviting you to begin moving toward the center.

What does it mean to orient toward Jesus? It means asking: Where is Jesus already Lord in my life? Where is he not yet Lord? What would it look like for Jesus to be the organizing center of my calendar, my relationships, my mission, my community?

This is about orientation. This is about direction. This is about movement toward the center.

## Visualization: The mDNA Compass

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Center**: "Jesus is Lord" in bold, with a hard center circle (like a well)
- **Outer Ring**: Six elements arranged in a circle around the center:
  - Disciple Making
  - Missional-Incarnational
  - Liminality-Communitas
  - APEST Culture
  - Organic Systems
  - (Jesus is Lord is both center and part of the system)
- **Field**: "Holy Spirit" as the living environment surrounding the whole (light background, flowing lines)
- **Arrows**: Bidirectional lines between all elements to show systemic reciprocity
- **User's Location**: A marker showing where the user currently is on the journey (like a pin on a map)
- **User's Scores**: Each element shows the user's current level (1-5) with color coding:
  - Level 1: Gray
  - Level 2: Amber
  - Level 3: Emerald
  - Level 4: Blue
  - Level 5: Violet
- **Limiting Factor**: Highlighted with a pulsing border or different visual treatment
- **Orientation Arrow**: An arrow pointing from the user's location toward the center (Jesus is Lord)

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel like a compass, not a report card. Show location. Show direction. Show movement. Make it feel like a journey. The center should feel like a gravitational pull. The whole should feel like a living system.

## AI Agent Interaction: Journey Guide (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: Journey Guide

**Approach**: The agent helps users understand their assessment results and begin orienting toward Jesus as the center.

**Input**: User's assessment results (element scores, overall level, limiting factor)

**Process**:

1. **Welcome and Orientation**: "Welcome to your mDNA formation journey. Let's begin by understanding where you are. Your assessment results tell a story—of where you are right now. This is your starting point."

2. **Celebration**: The agent identifies and celebrates the user's top two strengths across the six elements. "Your highest scores are in [Element 1] and [Element 2]. These are areas where Jesus' lordship is already shaping your life. Let's celebrate this."

3. **Growth Edges**: The agent identifies two primary growth edges. "Your assessment reveals that [Element] and [Element] are areas where Jesus is inviting you to grow. These are invitations."

4. **Limiting Factor Explanation**: The agent explains the limiting factor and why it matters. "Your limiting factor is [Element]. This element constrains your whole system. When we strengthen this, we help the whole. This is an invitation."

5. **Lordship Check**: The agent checks if "Jesus is Lord" is the limiting factor or below Level 3. If so, it prioritizes this. "Because Jesus is Lord is your limiting factor (or below Level 3), we must address this first. All other growth depends on this foundation. This is where we all begin. This is where formation starts."

6. **Orientation Exercise**: The agent helps the user begin orienting toward Jesus. "Let's begin orienting toward Jesus as the center. Where is Jesus already Lord in your life? Where is he not yet Lord? What would it look like for Jesus to be the organizing center?"

7. **Micro-Plan Generation**: The agent proposes a 4-week micro-plan:
   - Week 1: One simple orientation practice (prayer, Scripture, reflection)
   - Week 2: One practice that moves toward the center
   - Week 3: One step toward addressing the limiting factor
   - Week 4: One evidence collection point

8. **Accountability Setup**: The agent schedules 5-minute weekly nudges and creates a simple debrief template.

**Output**: A personalized journey map showing where the user is, where they're going, and a 4-week micro-plan to begin the journey.

**Tone**: Warm, encouraging, invitational. The agent speaks as a guide. It celebrates growth and invites next steps. It meets the user where they are.

## Level-Adaptive Content

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Extra Support Content**:

**"What is mDNA?" Explainer Video** (5-7 minutes)

*Content to be created*: A warm, accessible introduction to mDNA for those new to the framework. Should include:
- Simple explanation of what mDNA is (the genetic code of Jesus movements)
- The six elements in accessible language
- Why this matters for personal formation
- Encouragement that everyone starts somewhere
- Visual metaphors (seed, tree, DNA, river)

**Encouragement Message**:

Friends, if you find yourself at Level 1 or 2, know this: the seed is present. The code is there. The potential for movement exists. You are beginning a journey of awakening.

Your assessment results are an invitation. Jesus is inviting you to take one step. One command. One practice. One person. One place. Movement begins with a single act of obedience.

**Simplified Practices**:

- **Practice 1**: "Identify one clear command from Jesus and obey it this week. Reflect on what resistance you encountered."
- **Practice 2**: "Find one person to guide you. Ask someone you trust to help you identify one thing Jesus is asking you to obey."
- **Practice 3**: "Establish one simple weekly rhythm: pray, read Scripture, or serve. Do it three times. Review what you learned."

**Foundation Building**:

- Daily prayer rhythm (5 minutes)
- Weekly Scripture reading (one passage, one action step)
- One relationship for accountability

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Standard Curriculum**:

You are at Level 3. This means consistent practices are emerging. Observable lifestyle changes are happening. The whole-of-life integration has begun. Patterns endure under mild stress.

Your assessment reveals where you are strong and where you need to grow. Your limiting factor is the element that needs the most attention. Focus there first. Strengthen the weakest element, and you help the whole system.

**Practices**:

- Focus on limiting factor with intentional practices
- Integrate lordship into one area of life (calendar, budget, relationships)
- Begin thinking in generations (who are you discipling? Who are they discipling?)

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Advanced Reflection**:

You are at Level 4 or 5. This means multiplication is happening. You can trace generations. New communities are emerging. Patterns are being adopted by others.

Your assessment reveals areas for refinement. Even at Level 4-5, there is always growth. The question is: How will you multiply this learning? How will you equip others? How will you ensure the ecosystem survives your absence?

**Practices**:

- Coach someone else into lordship-centered formation
- Design for transfer (how will others learn what you've learned?)
- Multiply equippers (who can you train to train others?)

## Cohort Session: Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal

### Explore (15 minutes)

**Discussion Questions**:

1. What brought you here? What are you hoping to learn?
2. What did your assessment affirm? Where did it surprise you?
3. Which element scored highest? What does that tell you about where Jesus' lordship is already shaping your life?
4. Which element is your limiting factor? What does that tell you about where Jesus is inviting you to grow?
5. What would it mean for Jesus to be the organizing center of your life?

**Facilitation Notes**: The facilitator should create space for honest sharing. This is about seeing where we are and where we are called to go. Encourage participants to share both strengths and growth edges. Make it safe. Make it warm. Make it invitational.

### Evaluate (15 minutes)

**Critical Reflection**:

1. How does understanding the maturity model help you see your journey?
2. Which single shift would most lift your whole system? Why?
3. If you addressed your limiting factor, how would that help the other elements?
4. Where is Jesus already Lord in your life? Where is he not yet Lord?
5. What fears or resistance do you encounter when you think about orienting toward Jesus as the center?

**Facilitation Notes**: Help participants think systemically. The limiting factor constrains the whole. When we strengthen it, we help everything. But this requires honesty about resistance and fear. Create space for vulnerability. This is formation, not performance.

### Employ (15 minutes)

**Action Planning**:

1. Choose one orientation practice from your 4-week micro-plan
2. Calendar it this week
3. Share your plan with one person in your cohort for accountability
4. Identify one piece of evidence you will collect

**Facilitation Notes**: Keep it simple. One practice. One week. One person for accountability. One piece of evidence. Movement begins with small, faithful steps.

### Journal (10 minutes)

**Reflection Prompt**:

"Where am I right now, and where is Jesus inviting me to go?"

**Journaling Guidelines**:

- Write for 10 minutes without stopping
- Be honest about where you are
- Be hopeful about where you're going
- Be specific about what you will do
- End with a prayer of orientation

---

## Closing: Beginning the Journey (10 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began where you are. We explored the maturity model. We introduced the six elements. We helped you understand your assessment results. We began orienting toward Jesus as the center.

This is the journey. It begins with knowing where you are. It continues with moving toward the center. It ends with Jesus as Lord of all.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "I am at [your level] on the journey, and Jesus is inviting me to [your next step]."

This is your commitment for this week. This is how you will begin orienting toward the center.

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you meet us where we are. You invite us to come as we are. As we begin this journey, help us see where we are with honesty and hope. Help us understand the map. Help us orient toward you as our center. We trust you to lead us. We trust you to form us. We trust you to multiply us. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who meets you where you are. Practice one orientation exercise. Collect one piece of evidence. Return next week to share what you learned. The journey begins now. The movement multiplies from here.

## Next Week Preview

Next week, we dive deep into Jesus is Lord. We will explore how Jesus' lordship is the organizing center of all formation. We will learn to remove the "queen piece" that centralizes around us. We will practice orienting our lives around Jesus as the center. We will discover how identity in Christ propels mission.

Everything we learn about Jesus' lordship flows from understanding where we are. We begin where we are. We move toward the center. We orient our lives around Jesus.

Come prepared. Bring your assessment results. Bring your orientation practice. Bring your questions. We will build on this foundation.
