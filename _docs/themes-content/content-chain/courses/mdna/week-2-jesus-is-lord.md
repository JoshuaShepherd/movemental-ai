# Week 2: Jesus is Lord

**Theme**: "Jesus is Lord: The Organizing Center"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with centered-set practice and queen piece removal

---

## Big Idea

Jesus is Lord is the gravitational core of a people sent into the world. Every historic Jesus movement placed this confession at the center and discovered that identity in Christ releases mission through ordinary disciples who embody the gospel in daily life. When Jesus is truly Lord, everything else finds its place. This week, we explore how Jesus' lordship is the organizing center of all formation, all mission, and all movement.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand "Jesus is Lord" as the organizing center for identity, mission, and multiplication
- Apply centered-set imagination (hard center, soft edges) to recalibrate life around Christ
- Identify and remove the "queen piece" that centralizes around us
- Practice orienting calendar, relationships, and mission around Jesus' lordship
- Connect lordship to all other mDNA elements

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and the Organizing Center (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, The Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." —Deuteronomy 6:4-5

> "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.'" —Matthew 28:18-19

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with the confession that changes everything: Jesus is Lord.

This is the gravitational center that reshapes everything—our identity, our obedience, our mission, our community. When Paul writes to the Philippians that "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow" (Philippians 2:10), he is describing a reality that already exists. Jesus is Lord of all creation, whether we acknowledge it or not. The question is whether we will live as if it is true.

Last week, we met you where you are. We explored the maturity model. We introduced the six elements. We began orienting toward Jesus as the center. This week, we dive deep into what it means for Jesus to be Lord. We explore how this confession organizes everything else. We practice removing the "queen piece" that centralizes around us. We learn to live as if Jesus is truly Lord.

Jesus' lordship is the organizing center. It is the gravitational force that shapes all the other elements. When Jesus is truly Lord, every other element finds its proper place.

This is why the model includes what we call the "lordship gate." No overall Level 5 classification is possible if "Jesus is Lord" is below Level 3. This reflects the theological reality that all maturity flows from the confession that Jesus is King.

We begin here. We explore lordship as the center. We practice orienting our lives around it. We remove what competes with it. We yield to it.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: Where is Jesus already Lord in my life? Where is he not yet Lord? What would it look like for Jesus to be the organizing center of my calendar, my relationships, my mission, my community? What competes with Jesus' lordship?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are King. You are Lord. All authority in heaven and on earth belongs to you. As we explore your lordship, we submit our lives to your rule. We submit our calendars to your priorities. We submit our relationships to your purposes. We submit our mission to your direction. Teach us to live as if you are truly Lord. Amen.

## Main Content: The Organizing Center (30 minutes)

### The Gravitational Core

Jesus is Lord is the gravitational core of mDNA. From this center, the whole community receives energy for a missional, apostolic way of life. The earliest Jesus movements gave this confession pride of place, and it catalyzed world-shaping outcomes in ordinary people.

Think of it like a solar system. The sun is at the center. All the planets orbit around it. The sun's gravity holds everything together. Without the sun, the system collapses.

Jesus is Lord is like that sun. It is the center. All the other elements orbit around it. Its gravity holds everything together. Without lordship at the center, the system collapses.

This is lived reality. When Jesus is truly Lord, our identity is secure. Our mission is clear. Our community is centered. Our systems serve life. Our formation moves forward.

### Centered-Set Thinking

Centered-set thinking helps us visualize this: Jesus is the well at the center. We help people move toward him. The "edges" can be soft and diverse because the center is hard and clear.

We cultivate hunger for the center—Christ himself. We ask, "Are you moving toward the center or away from it?"

Practically, this means pruning cluttered activities that do not align with Jesus' way and nurturing simple practices that embed his lordship in calendars, tables, neighborhoods, and teams.

The center is hard. Jesus is Lord. This is non-negotiable. This is the foundation. This is the center.

The edges are soft. How we express lordship can vary. How we practice can differ. How we organize can adapt. The center remains: Jesus is Lord.

### The Indicative-Imperative Arc

The indicative gives rise to the imperative. Who Jesus is (indicative) shapes what we do (imperative).

Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (indicative). "Therefore go and make disciples" (imperative). The authority precedes the command. The lordship precedes the mission.

When we receive the indicative—Jesus is Lord—we are compelled toward the imperative—practice the way of the Kingdom. We work because lordship is true.

This is the pattern throughout Scripture. God says, "I am the Lord your God" (indicative). "Therefore, you shall have no other gods" (imperative). The identity precedes the obedience. The reality precedes the response.

When we live this way, formation happens.

### The Lordship Gate

"Jesus is Lord" gates all other elements.

No overall Level 5 classification is possible if "Jesus is Lord" is below Level 3. This reflects the theological reality that all maturity flows from the confession that Jesus is King.

If "Jesus is Lord" is your limiting factor, you must address it first. You cannot achieve high overall maturity without a lived center in Jesus. All other growth depends on this foundation.

The lordship gate also means that even if "Jesus is Lord" is not your limiting factor, if it is below Level 3, it will cap your overall maturity. You might have high maturity in other elements, but without lordship as the foundation, the whole structure is unstable.

We always begin with lordship. We always return to lordship. Lordship is the center from which everything else flows.

### Removing the Queen Piece

We must remove the "queen piece" that centralizes around us.

In chess, the queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any direction. She controls the board. When the queen is removed, the other pieces must step up. The game becomes more distributed. More players participate.

In our lives and communities, we often have a "queen piece"—a person, program, or platform that everything depends on. When that piece is removed, we discover the body's capacity. We find that others can lead. We see that the system can function without the center.

This is about distributing leadership. It's about pushing authority to the edges. It's about trusting the body.

When we remove the queen piece, we demonstrate that Jesus is Lord, not our programs. We show that the Spirit distributes gifts across the body. We enable multiplication.

### Identity and Mission

Identity in Christ propels mission.

"Jesus is Lord" declares who we are and how we live. The indicative gives rise to the imperative. Identity shapes practice. Practice multiplies into movement.

When we know who we are in Christ, we know what we're called to do. When we know that Jesus is Lord, we know we're sent. When we know we're sent, we go. When we go, we multiply.

This is the pattern: identity → practice → movement. It all flows from lordship. It all returns to lordship. Lordship is the center.

## Visualization: The Centered-Set Well

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Hard Center**: "Jesus is Lord" (the well) - bold, clear, non-negotiable
- **Soft Edges**: Diverse people and micro-expressions oriented toward the center (arrows pointing toward the well)
- **Radiating Ring**: The six mDNA elements, linked in a web around the center
- **Field**: "Holy Spirit" enveloping the whole (context of life and power) - light background, flowing lines
- **Movement Indicators**: Arrows showing movement toward the center (some closer, some further, but all oriented toward the well)
- **Queen Piece**: Visual showing what centralizes around us (person, program, platform) that needs to be removed
- **Distributed Capacity**: Visual showing how removing the queen piece releases the body's capacity

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel like a well, not a diagram. Show the gravitational pull. Show movement. Show diversity at the edges. Make the center feel like a place people are drawn toward. The whole should feel organic and alive.

## AI Agent Interaction: Christocentric Audit (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: Christocentric Audit

**Approach**: The agent helps users identify where Jesus is and isn't Lord, and design practices to orient around the center.

**Input**: User's calendar, their core activities, their relationships, their mission context

**Process**:

1. **Calendar Review**: "Let's look at your calendar. Which activities clearly reflect Jesus' priorities? Which activities do not clearly reflect Jesus' priorities?"

2. **Activity Audit**: "Tell me about two core activities in your life. How do these align with Jesus' lordship? Where do they compete with it?"

3. **Queen Piece Identification**: "What is your 'queen piece'? What person, program, or platform does everything depend on? What would happen if you removed it?"

4. **Misalignment Identification**: The agent identifies two misaligned activities to prune and proposes one "Jesus-centered" practice to plant (simple, reproducible).

5. **Centered-Set Practice**: "How can you redesign one activity to be more centered-set? How can you help people move toward Jesus rather than policing boundaries?"

6. **Implementation Plan**: The agent creates a simple plan: prune one activity, plant one practice, remove one dependency.

7. **Accountability Setup**: The agent schedules a 5-minute nudge for midweek review and end-of-week debrief.

**Output**: A Christocentric audit report with specific activities to prune, practices to plant, and dependencies to remove, plus a simple implementation plan.

**Tone**: Supportive, challenging, focused on alignment and simplicity. The agent speaks as a guide helping users orient toward the center.

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Prune one activity. Plant one Jesus-centered practice."

**Rationale**: Begin with simple alignment. Learn to orient around the center.

**Field Experiment**: "Run one 'Jesus-is-Lord audit' on your weekly calendar. Identify one practice to prune and one to plant that more clearly aligns with Jesus' way."

**Steps**:
1. Review your calendar for the past week
2. Identify activities that clearly reflect Jesus' priorities
3. Identify activities that do not clearly reflect Jesus' priorities
4. Choose one activity to prune (stop doing it, or do it differently)
5. Choose one activity to plant (start doing it, or do it more intentionally)
6. Communicate the "why" to your cohort: "I'm doing this because Jesus is Lord"
7. Document: What did you prune? What did you plant? How did this align you with the center?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the activity you pruned
- One paragraph on the practice you planted
- One reflection on how this aligns you with Jesus' lordship

**Encouragement**: "You are learning to orient around the center. This is the beginning of formation."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Reshape one ministry meeting around the centered-set. Remove one queen piece."

**Rationale**: Integrate lordship into organizational life. Begin distributing leadership.

**Field Experiment**: "Reshape one ministry meeting around the centered-set. Identify one 'queen piece' and design a way to remove it."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one ministry meeting or activity
2. Redesign it around the centered-set: How can this help people move toward Jesus?
3. Identify one "queen piece" (person, program, platform everything depends on)
4. Design a way to remove it: Who else could lead? How can we distribute this?
5. Implement the change
6. Debrief: What happened? How did removing the queen piece help? What did you learn?
7. Document: What did you change? How did it work? What did you learn about lordship?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the meeting you reshaped
- One paragraph on the queen piece you removed
- One reflection on how this demonstrated Jesus' lordship

**Focus**: Integrate lordship into organizational life. Begin distributing leadership. Trust the body.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Facilitate a multi-church 'centered-set' conversation. Multiply the practice."

**Rationale**: Multiply lordship-centered formation. Extend the practice to others.

**Field Experiment**: "Facilitate a conversation with 3-5 leaders about centered-set thinking. Share one practice across sites."

**Steps**:
1. Identify 3-5 leaders from different contexts
2. Facilitate a conversation about centered-set thinking: How is Jesus the center? How are we moving toward him?
3. Share one practice that helps orient around the center
4. Invite others to adapt it for their contexts
5. Follow up: How did it work? What did you learn?
6. Document: How did the conversation go? How did practices multiply? What did you learn about multiplying lordship-centered formation?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the conversation you facilitated
- One story of how a practice multiplied
- One reflection on what you learned about multiplying lordship-centered formation

**Focus**: Multiply lordship-centered formation. Extend the practice. Trust the Spirit to form what we cannot manufacture.

## Field Experiment: Jesus-is-Lord Audit (45-60 minutes)

### Objective

Run one "Jesus-is-Lord audit" on your weekly calendar. Identify one practice to prune and one to plant that more clearly aligns with Jesus' way.

### Steps

1. **Review Your Calendar** (15 minutes)
   - Look at your calendar for the past week
   - Identify activities that clearly reflect Jesus' priorities
   - Identify activities that do not clearly reflect Jesus' priorities
   - Be honest. No judgment. Just observation.

2. **Identify One Practice to Prune** (10 minutes)
   - Choose one activity that does not clearly serve Jesus' way
   - Ask: Why does this exist? What would happen if I stopped?
   - Consider: Is this a "queen piece" that centralizes around me?

3. **Identify One Practice to Plant** (10 minutes)
   - Choose one small, reproducible practice that reflects Jesus' way
   - Examples: Weekly table with neighbors, Scripture-and-prayer huddle in workplace, time for relationships and presence
   - Keep it simple. One practice. One week.

4. **Communicate the Why** (10 minutes)
   - Share your plan with your cohort
   - Explain the "why" in terms of Jesus' lordship
   - Invite feedback and accountability

### Evidence to Collect

- Screenshot of your calendar audit
- One paragraph on the practice you will prune
- One paragraph on the practice you will plant
- One sentence on how this reflects Jesus' lordship

### Personalization by Track

**Track 1 (Solo/Small Team)**: Choose one micro-habit at home and one in your neighborhood. Keep it simple. One practice. One place.

**Track 2 (Church Staff/Medium)**: Reshape one ministry meeting around the centered-set. How can this meeting reflect Jesus' lordship?

**Track 3 (Network/City Catalyst)**: Convene 3-5 leaders to compare assessments and agree on one shared experiment. How can we practice Jesus' lordship together?

## Integration: How Lordship Connects to All Elements (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When Jesus is Lord, all other elements find their place. Disciple making multiplies his lordship. Missional-incarnational impulse extends his lordship. APEST equips the body under his lordship. Organic systems organize for his lordship. Liminality-communitas forms through his lordship.

This is the connection. Lordship is the center. All elements orbit around it. All formation moves toward it. All multiplication extends it.

### Reflection

How does lordship prevent compartmentalization? When we know that Jesus is Lord, we see the whole system. We integrate all elements. We align everything around the center. His lordship keeps us focused on the whole, not just the parts.

### Commitment

"I will orient my life around Jesus' lordship. I will prune what competes. I will plant what aligns. I will remove the queen piece. I will trust the body."

## Closing: Lordship and Formation (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the confession that changes everything: Jesus is Lord.

We explored how lordship is the organizing center. We learned about centered-set thinking. We identified the queen piece. We practiced orienting around the center.

Lordship is the gravitational core. It shapes everything. It organizes everything. It forms everything.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your lordship commitment]."

This is your commitment for this week. This is how you will orient around the center.

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are King. You are Lord. All authority in heaven and on earth belongs to you. As we learn to live under your lordship, we submit our calendars to your priorities. We submit our relationships to your purposes. We submit our mission to your direction. Teach us to live as if you are truly Lord. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Prune one activity. Plant one practice. Remove one queen piece. Return next week to share what you learned. The formation begins now.
