# Week 3: Missional-Incarnational

**Theme**: "Missional-Incarnational: How Jesus' Lordship Sends Us"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with contextualization practice

---

## Big Idea

As the Father sent the Son, so we are sent. Mission is God's initiative. We are sent into the world, embedded in specific contexts, present among people who do not yet know Jesus. This sentness flows from the confession that Jesus is Lord. When we go, we extend his lordship. When we embed, we demonstrate his incarnation. When we contextualize, we honor his rule over all cultures.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand mission as God's initiative (missio Dei)
- Practice incarnational presence in third places
- Contextualize the gospel while maintaining core integrity
- Design for insider leadership
- Connect sentness to Jesus' lordship

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and Our Sentness (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.'" —John 20:21

> "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth." —John 1:14

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with a question: How does Jesus' lordship shape our sentness?

The answer is found in Jesus' words to his disciples: "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." This is the pattern. The Father sent the Son. The Son sends us. Mission is God's initiative.

When we confess that Jesus is Lord, we are receiving a commission. We are being sent. We are being embedded. We are being called to go out and go deep.

This sentness flows from lordship. Jesus is Lord over all creation. His rule extends to every neighborhood, every workplace, every culture. When we go, we extend his lordship. When we embed, we demonstrate his incarnation. When we contextualize, we honor his rule over all cultures.

We go to embed. We go to be present and stay. We go to learn and serve.

This is incarnational presence. As the Father sent the Son, and the Son became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are sent to become flesh in our contexts. We show up. We stay. We learn. We serve. We love.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: Where is Jesus sending me? Where am I already present? How does my presence extend his lordship? What would it look like to embed more deeply?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. As the Father sent you, so you send us. As you became flesh and dwelt among us, so we are called to become flesh in our contexts. Teach us to go. Teach us to embed. Teach us to extend your lordship through presence. Amen.

## Main Content: Sent-and-Embedded (30 minutes)

### Mission as God's Initiative

Mission is God's initiative. This is what we mean by missio Dei—the mission of God.

God the Father sent the Son. The Son sends the Spirit. The Spirit sends the church. This is the trinitarian pattern. Mission flows from the sending nature of God.

We join it. We embody it. We participate in what God is already doing.

This changes everything. We are joining what God is already doing. We are discovering where God already is.

### Incarnational Presence

We go as the Son went. We embed as the Son embedded. We become flesh as the Son became flesh.

The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. This is the incarnation. God came near. God became concrete. God came to earth.

This is our pattern. We go to neighborhoods. We enter third places. We become present.

Incarnational presence means showing up in the same place at the same time. It means neighbors name you as "one of us." It means you serve with, not for. It means the gospel emerges from within the culture.

### The "Come to Us" vs. "Go to Them" Shift

The pattern of Jesus is "go to them." He went to the tax collectors and sinners. He went to the Samaritans and Gentiles. He went to the margins and the forgotten.

This is a lordship shift. When we confess that Jesus is Lord, we are confessing that his rule extends everywhere. We go to where they are, and we discover he is already there.

### Contextualization and Core Integrity

We contextualize while maintaining core integrity.

The gospel is universal. It applies to all cultures. The expression of the gospel is contextual. It adapts to local culture while maintaining core truth.

This is the pattern of the incarnation. Jesus was fully God and fully human. He was universal truth in local expression. He was eternal Word in temporal flesh.

When we contextualize, we honor this pattern. We maintain the core DNA—Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST, organic systems, liminality-communitas. We allow the forms to adapt. We let the gospel emerge from within the culture.

This requires learning. We must learn the language. We must learn the symbols. We must learn the pain points. We must learn what good news sounds like in their voice.

### People of Peace

Jesus sent his disciples with this instruction: "When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you" (Luke 10:5-6).

This is the pattern: look for people of peace. These are people who are open. They are people who welcome you. They are people who are curious. They are people who become bridges.

We look for open doors. We respond to invitations. We discover relationships.

### Insider Leadership

We design for insider leadership.

When we embed, we identify locals who can lead. We equip insiders to take over. We stop doing things so others can step in.

This is multiplication. This is sustainability. This is movement. When locals lead, the movement becomes indigenous. When insiders take over, the movement becomes sustainable. When we step back, the movement multiplies.

## Visualization: The Sentness Map

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Center**: "Jesus is Lord" with arrows going outward
- **Your Current Location**: "Where you are" (home, workplace, neighborhood)
- **Third Places**: Circles showing potential third places (coffee shop, gym, park, community center)
- **People of Peace**: Icons or names of people who are open, curious, welcoming
- **Embedding Depth**: Visual indicator showing depth of presence (surface, embedded, deeply embedded)
- **Insider Leadership**: Arrows showing potential insider leaders
- **Contextualization**: Notes on local culture, language, symbols, pain points

**Design Notes**: The map should feel like a journey. Use flowing lines. Show connection. Make it feel like discovery.

## AI Agent Interaction: People/Place Scanner (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: People/Place Scanner

**Approach**: The agent helps users identify people of peace and third places in their context.

**Input**: User's context (neighborhood, workplace, daily rhythms), their current relationships, their openness to new places

**Process**:

1. **Context Mapping**: "Tell me about your context. Where do you live? Where do you work? Where do you spend time?"

2. **Third Place Identification**: "Where are the third places in your context? Coffee shops? Parks? Community centers? Where do people gather who are not yet following Jesus?"

3. **People of Peace Discovery**: "Who are the people of peace in your life? Who is open? Who is curious? Who welcomes you? Who asks questions?"

4. **Presence Planning**: "How can you show up in the same place at the same time? What would it look like to become a regular?"

5. **Contextualization Guide**: "What is the local culture? What are the symbols? What are the pain points? What would good news sound like in their voice?"

6. **Insider Leadership**: "Who are the locals who could lead? How can you equip them? What can you stop doing so they can step in?"

**Output**: A contextual map with third places, people of peace, and a presence plan.

**Tone**: Curious, exploratory, focused on discovery and learning.

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Begin weekly presence in one third place."

**Rationale**: Start with simple, consistent presence. Show up. Be present. Learn to listen.

**Field Experiment**: "Show up in the same place at the same time three times this week. Just be present. Listen. Observe. Document what you learned."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one third place (coffee shop, gym, park, community center)
2. Show up at the same time three times this week
3. Just be present. No agenda. No pressure. Just show up.
4. Observe: Who is here? What are they talking about? What are their concerns?
5. Listen: What stories do you hear? What needs do you discover?
6. Document: What did you learn? What surprised you? What questions do you have?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the third place you chose
- One observation about the people there
- One story you heard
- One reflection on what you learned

**Encouragement**: "You are learning to be present. You are discovering where God already is. This is the beginning."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Practice hospitality—share meals with non-believers monthly."

**Rationale**: Deepen relationships through table fellowship. Move from presence to relationship.

**Field Experiment**: "Share a meal with a neighbor or co-worker. Listen for story and need. Practice contextual good news."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one person from your third place or neighborhood
2. Invite them to share a meal (your home, their home, a restaurant)
3. Listen for their story: What is their life like? What are their joys? What are their struggles?
4. Listen for their needs: What do they need? How can you serve?
5. Practice contextual good news: How would you share the gospel in their language? What would good news sound like for them?
6. Follow up: How can you continue to be present? How can you serve?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the person you shared a meal with
- One story you heard
- One need you identified
- One reflection on what good news sounds like for them

**Focus**: Move from presence to relationship. Practice hospitality. Learn to contextualize.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Equip insiders to lead. Stop doing something so they can step in."

**Rationale**: Multiplication through insider leadership. Sustainability through local ownership.

**Field Experiment**: "Identify one local person who could lead. Stop doing something you are doing so they can step into that role. Equip them to lead."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one local person who could lead (someone from the context, someone trusted, someone with influence)
2. Identify one thing you are doing that they could do (leading a gathering, organizing an event, serving a need)
3. Stop doing it. Step back. Create space.
4. Equip them: Walk with them. Support them. Resource them.
5. Let them lead: They take over. You support from the side.
6. Document: What happened? How did they lead? What did you learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the insider leader you identified
- One thing you stopped doing
- One story of how they led
- One reflection on what you learned about insider leadership

**Focus**: Multiply through insider leadership. Design for sustainability. Step back so others can step in.

## Cohort Session: Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal

### Explore (15 minutes)

**Discussion Questions**:

1. Who are your people of peace? Where are you a regular?
2. What have you learned by listening on their turf?
3. How would you share the gospel in their language?
4. How does Jesus' lordship shape where you go and how you embed?

### Evaluate (15 minutes)

**Critical Reflection**:

1. Are you operating with a "come to us" or "go to them" mindset?
2. Where are you extracting rather than embedding?
3. Who are the locals who could lead?
4. What would it take to design for insider leadership?

### Employ (15 minutes)

**Action Planning**:

1. Commit to 6-12 months of incarnational presence in one place
2. Identify one third place to show up regularly
3. Identify one person of peace to build relationship with
4. Design one way to practice hospitality

### Journal (10 minutes)

**Reflection Prompt**:

"What's the good news for your context in their words?"

## Integration: How Sentness Connects to Lordship (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When we go, we extend Jesus' lordship. When we embed, we demonstrate his incarnation. When we contextualize, we honor his rule over all cultures.

This is the connection. Jesus is Lord over all creation. His rule extends to every neighborhood, every workplace, every culture. When we go, we are discovering where God already is. We are joining what God is already doing.

When we contextualize the gospel, we honor Jesus' lordship over all cultures. We maintain core integrity while allowing local expression. We let the gospel emerge from within.

### Reflection

How does lordship prevent syncretism? When we maintain that Jesus is Lord, we maintain the center. We can adapt the forms while keeping the core. We can contextualize while maintaining integrity.

### Commitment

"I will go where Jesus sends me. I will embed as he embedded. I will extend his lordship through presence."

---

## Closing: Lordship and Sentness (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the question: How does Jesus' lordship shape our sentness?

The answer: We go because Jesus is Lord. We embed because he embedded. We contextualize because his rule extends to all cultures.

Mission is God's initiative. We join it. We discover where God already is.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your sentness commitment]."

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. As the Father sent you, so you send us. Teach us to go. Teach us to embed. Teach us to extend your lordship through presence. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Show up in one place. Be present. Listen. Learn. Return next week to share what you discovered. The sentness begins now.

## Next Week Preview

Next week, we explore Disciple Making. We will learn how Jesus' lordship multiplies through discipleship. We will design simple, reproducible disciple pathways. We will launch obedience-based discipling relationships. We will think in generations.

Everything we learn about disciple making flows from the confession that Jesus is Lord. Lordship is the center. Discipleship is the multiplication of lordship.

Come prepared. Bring your presence stories. Bring your contextualization experiments. We will build on this foundation.
