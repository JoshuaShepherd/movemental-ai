# Week 4: Disciple Making

**Theme**: "Disciple Making: How Jesus' Lordship Multiplies"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with interactive practice design

---

## Big Idea

Disciple making is the strategic nerve of movement. Movements multiply because discipleship is the core process. When disciples make disciples who make disciples, movement happens. This multiplication flows from the confession that Jesus is Lord. When we disciple under Jesus' authority, we extend his lordship through generations.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand discipleship as the strategic nerve of movement
- Design a simple, reproducible disciple pathway
- Launch an obedience-based discipling relationship
- Think in generations (to third/fourth)
- Connect disciple making to Jesus' lordship

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and Disciple Making (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.'" —Matthew 28:18-20

> "And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others." —2 Timothy 2:2

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with a question: How does disciple making flow from the confession that Jesus is Lord?

The answer is found in Jesus' final words to his disciples. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," he says. This is the indicative—who Jesus is. "Therefore go and make disciples," he continues. This is the imperative—what we do because of who he is.

The authority precedes the command. The lordship precedes the multiplication. We make disciples because Jesus is Lord. We extend his lordship through generations.

When we disciple someone, we are apprenticing them to Jesus. We are helping them learn to live under his lordship. We are showing them how to obey his commands. We are extending his rule through our relationships.

This is why disciple making is the strategic nerve. Movements multiply because discipleship is the core process. When disciples make disciples who make disciples, movement happens.

We disciple under Jesus' authority. We disciple them to Jesus. We point them to the center. We help them move toward the well. We extend his lordship.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: Who am I discipling? Am I discipling them to Jesus or to myself? How does Jesus' lordship shape my discipling methods? What would it look like to disciple under his authority?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. All authority belongs to you. As we learn about disciple making, we submit our relationships to your lordship. Teach us to disciple others to you. Help us extend your rule through generations. Amen.

## Main Content: Disciple Making as Strategic Nerve (30 minutes)

### Why Disciple Making Matters

Disciple making is the strategic nerve of movement. This is observable reality.

Consider what happens when disciple making is weak. People consume content but do not change. Programs run but do not multiply. Activities happen but do not transform. The movement stalls.

Consider what happens when disciple making is strong. People learn to obey Jesus. They begin to disciple others. Those others disciple others. Generations emerge. Multiplication happens. The movement multiplies.

This is why disciple making is strategic. It is the process that makes everything else possible. Without discipleship, there is no multiplication. Without multiplication, there is no movement.

Disciple making is about obedience formation. We are apprenticing them to obey more.

### The Obedience-Based Framework

The early church understood this. They modeled obedience. They showed people how to follow Jesus. They created patterns that others could reproduce.

This is what we mean by obedience-based discipleship. It is a framework built on three simple steps: hear, obey, share.

**Hear**: We read Scripture together. We listen for what Jesus is saying. We identify one clear command.

**Obey**: We commit to obeying that command this week. We take one action step. We practice what we heard.

**Share**: We come back together. We account for what we did. We share what we learned. We process together.

This framework is simple. It is reproducible. It focuses on obedience. It creates patterns that multiply.

### Generational Thinking

We think in generations.

Paul writes to Timothy: "And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others" (2 Timothy 2:2).

Notice the pattern: Paul to Timothy. Timothy to reliable people. Reliable people to others. This is generational thinking.

When we disciple someone, we are preparing them to disciple others. We are thinking to the third and fourth generation. We are designing for transfer.

Can you identify someone you are discipling? Can you identify someone they are discipling? This is the test. This is where multiplication becomes visible.

### The Lordship Connection

All of this flows from the confession that Jesus is Lord.

When we disciple under Jesus' authority, we extend his lordship. When we think in generations, we multiply his rule. When we focus on obedience, we demonstrate his authority.

This is why disciple making is the strategic nerve. It is the process through which Jesus' lordship multiplies. It is the mechanism through which movement happens.

We disciple them to Jesus. We point them to the center. We help them move toward the well. We extend his lordship.

### Simple and Reproducible

The framework must be simple. It must be reproducible. If it requires experts, it will not multiply. If it requires resources, it will not scale. If it requires programs, it will not move.

The obedience-based framework is simple: hear, obey, share. Anyone can do it. A new believer can do it. A busy parent can do it. A bi-vocational leader can do it.

This is the test of movemental discipleship: Can a new believer reproduce this with someone else? If the answer is yes, we have created something that can multiply.

## Visualization: The Generational Tree

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Root**: "Jesus is Lord" at the base
- **Trunk**: "You" in the middle
- **Branches**: Generational levels:
  - Generation 1: "Your Disciple" (one branch)
  - Generation 2: "Their Disciple" (branch from Generation 1)
  - Generation 3: "Third Generation" (branch from Generation 2)
- **Fruit**: Observable outcomes at each generation:
  - Obedience
  - Transformation
  - Multiplication
- **User's Current State**: Highlight where the user currently is (e.g., "You are here" marker)
- **Growth Potential**: Show where multiplication could happen

**Design Notes**: The tree should feel organic and growing. Use flowing lines. Show connection between generations. Make it feel like a living system. Include space for users to write names at each generation level.

## AI Agent Interaction: Pathway Designer (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: Pathway Designer

**Approach**: The agent helps users design a simple, reproducible disciple pathway.

**Input**: User's current discipling relationships (if any), their maturity level, their context

**Process**:

1. **Assessment**: "Tell me about your current discipling relationships. Who are you discipling? Who is discipling you?"

2. **Framework Introduction**: "The obedience-based framework is simple: hear, obey, share. Let's design a pathway for your context."

3. **Pathway Design**: The agent helps design a 3-step pathway:
   - **Hear**: How will you read Scripture together? (weekly meeting, passage selection, listening process)
   - **Obey**: How will you commit to obedience? (one action step, accountability, evidence collection)
   - **Share**: How will you account together? (debrief process, learning sharing, next steps)

4. **Reproducibility Check**: "Can a new believer reproduce this? If not, let's simplify."

5. **Generational Thinking**: "Who could your disciple begin discipling? How will you prepare them for this?"

6. **Schedule Setup**: The agent creates a simple schedule template and accountability reminders.

**Output**: A one-page disciple pathway document that the user can use immediately and share with others.

**Tone**: Practical, encouraging, focused on simplicity and reproducibility.

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Find someone to disciple YOU first. Experience what you'll offer others."

**Rationale**: Before we can disciple others, we must experience being discipled. This is wisdom. We learn by receiving before we learn by giving.

**Field Experiment**: "Meet with a mentor or discipler weekly for 4 weeks. Focus on one obedience practice. Document what you learned about being discipled."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one person who could disciple you (someone further along, someone you trust)
2. Ask them: "Will you help me learn to follow Jesus? I want to practice one obedience loop with you."
3. Meet weekly for 4 weeks
4. Each week: Read one Scripture passage together, identify one action step, commit to obeying it, return to account
5. Document: What did you learn? How did this feel? What would you offer others?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on who is discipling you
- One paragraph on one thing you obeyed
- One reflection on what you learned about being discipled

**Encouragement**: "You are beginning. Everyone starts by being discipled. This is the foundation. Build it well."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Launch your first discipling relationship with clear obedience focus."

**Rationale**: You are ready to begin discipling. You have experienced being discipled. You have patterns that work. Now multiply them.

**Field Experiment**: "Start a 4-week discovery Scripture dialogue with one person. Focus on weekly obedience steps and check-ins."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one person you could begin discipling (new believer, someone seeking, someone ready to grow)
2. Invite them: "I'm learning to follow Jesus through a simple pattern: hear, obey, share. Would you like to try this with me for 4 weeks?"
3. Meet weekly for 4 weeks
4. Each week: Read one Scripture passage together, identify one action step, both commit to obeying it, return to account together
5. Document: What did your disciple obey? What transformation did you observe? What did you learn about discipling?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on who you are discipling
- One story of their obedience
- One reflection on what you learned about discipling

**Focus**: Keep it simple. One person. One pattern. One month. See what happens.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Train your disciple to disciple someone else. Think in generations."

**Rationale**: Multiplication is the test. Can your disciple disciple someone else? This is where movement happens.

**Field Experiment**: "Help your disciple identify one person they can begin discipling. Coach them to lead their first obedience loop with that person."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one of your disciples who is ready to multiply
2. Ask them: "Who could you begin discipling? Let's prepare you to lead your first obedience loop."
3. Coach them: Walk them through the hear-obey-share framework. Practice with them. Help them prepare.
4. Launch: They begin discipling someone else (third generation)
5. Support: Check in weekly. Help them process. Celebrate multiplication.
6. Document: Can you trace three generations? What did you observe? How did multiplication happen?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on your disciple's disciple (third generation)
- One story of generational multiplication
- One reflection on what you learned about multiplying discipling

**Focus**: Think in generations. Design for transfer. Multiply equippers.

## Cohort Session: Explore → Evaluate → Employ → Journal

### Explore (15 minutes)

**Discussion Questions**:

1. Who disciples you? Whom are you discipling? Be ruthlessly honest.
2. Is your current approach simple enough to reproduce? Knowledge-focused or obedience-centered?
3. Can you trace generations? Can you identify a spiritual grandchild?
4. How does Jesus' lordship shape your discipling methods?

**Facilitation Notes**: Create space for honesty. Some may not be discipling anyone. Some may be discipling but not thinking in generations. This is assessment. We see where we are so we can move forward.

### Evaluate (15 minutes)

**Critical Reflection**:

1. What is keeping your discipling pattern from reproducing beyond you?
2. Is your approach simple enough that a new believer could copy it?
3. Are you discipling people to Jesus or to yourself?
4. What would it take to think in generations?

**Facilitation Notes**: Help participants think about simplicity and reproducibility. The test is: Can someone else do this without you? If not, we need to simplify.

### Employ (15 minutes)

**Action Planning**:

1. Commit to a 3-6 month simple obedience loop with one person
2. Design your hear-obey-share framework
3. Identify one person for accountability
4. Schedule your first meeting

**Facilitation Notes**: Keep it simple. One person. One pattern. One commitment. Start small. Build from there.

### Journal (10 minutes)

**Reflection Prompt**:

"What did I obey from Jesus this week, and with whom did I process it?"

**Journaling Guidelines**:

- Write for 10 minutes without stopping
- Be specific about obedience (what did you do?)
- Be specific about processing (with whom did you share?)
- End with a commitment for next week

## Field Experiment: Begin a Discipling Relationship (45-90 minutes)

### Objective

Begin a 4-week discovery Scripture dialogue with one person. Focus on weekly obedience steps and check-ins.

### Steps

1. **Identify One Person** (15 minutes)
   - Who could you begin discipling? (new believer, someone seeking, someone ready to grow)
   - Who is already in your life? (neighbor, co-worker, friend, family member)
   - Who is open to learning? (someone asking questions, someone curious)

2. **Invite Them** (15 minutes)
   - Approach: "I'm learning to follow Jesus through a simple pattern: we read Scripture together, identify one thing to obey, do it, then come back to share what we learned. Would you like to try this with me for 4 weeks?"
   - Keep it low-pressure. This is an experiment. This is an invitation.
   - Set expectations: 4 weeks, weekly meetings, simple pattern

3. **Design Your Framework** (15 minutes)
   - **Hear**: How will you read Scripture? (one passage per week, read together or separately, discuss together)
   - **Obey**: How will you commit to obedience? (one action step each, both commit, accountability)
   - **Share**: How will you account? (weekly meeting, share what you did, process together)

4. **Launch Week 1** (30-45 minutes)
   - Meet together
   - Read one Scripture passage (suggest: Matthew 5-7, one section)
   - Ask: "What is Jesus saying here? What is one thing he is asking us to do?"
   - Each identify one action step
   - Both commit to doing it this week
   - Schedule next meeting

### Evidence to Collect

- One paragraph on who you are discipling
- One paragraph on your hear-obey-share framework
- One story of their obedience (after Week 1)
- One reflection on what you learned

### Personalization by Track

**Track 1 (Solo/Small Team)**: Start with a household rhythm. One person. One pattern. Keep it simple.

**Track 2 (Church Staff/Medium)**: Run the same weekly experiment across two different teams to compare learning. How does this work in different contexts?

**Track 3 (Network/City Catalyst)**: Coordinate a shared monthly stretch across 3-5 communities. Collect both local stories and cross-site patterns.

## Integration: How Disciple Making Connects to Lordship (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When discipleship multiplies, Jesus' lordship extends. This is the connection.

We disciple them to Jesus. We point them to the center. We help them move toward the well. We extend his lordship.

When we think in generations, we multiply his rule. When we focus on obedience, we demonstrate his authority. When we create simple, reproducible patterns, we enable multiplication.

This is why disciple making is the strategic nerve. It is the process through which Jesus' lordship multiplies. It is the mechanism through which movement happens.

### Reflection

How does generational thinking reveal lordship? When we can trace three or four generations, we see Jesus' lordship extending. We see his rule multiplying. We see his Kingdom coming.

### Commitment

"I will disciple under Jesus' lordship. I will point others to him. I will extend his rule through generations."

---

## Closing: Lordship and Multiplication (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the question: How does disciple making flow from the confession that Jesus is Lord?

The answer: We disciple under Jesus' authority. We extend his lordship through generations. We multiply his rule through simple, reproducible patterns.

Disciple making is the strategic nerve. It is the process that makes everything else possible. When disciples make disciples who make disciples, movement happens.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your discipling commitment]."

This is your commitment for this week. This is how you will extend his lordship.

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. All authority belongs to you. As we learn to make disciples, we submit our relationships to your lordship. Teach us to disciple others to you. Help us extend your rule through generations. Multiply your lordship through our obedience. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Begin one discipling relationship. Practice one obedience loop. Think in generations. Return next week to share what you learned. The multiplication begins now.

## Next Week Preview

Next week, we explore Apostolic Environment (APEST). We will learn how Jesus' lordship equips the whole body. We will discover our gifts. We will design APEST-diverse teams. We will multiply equippers.

Our gifting flows from lordship. Jesus gave gifts to the church. He distributes ministry across the body. When all five functions operate, his lordship is visible.

Come prepared. Bring your discipling experiment. Bring your obedience stories. We will build on this foundation.
