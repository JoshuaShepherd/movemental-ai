# Week 5: Apostolic

**Theme**: "APEST: How Jesus' Lordship Equips the Whole Body"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with gift discovery and team design

---

## Big Idea

Jesus gave gifts to the church. Ephesians 4:11-13 describes five gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. These are functions given to all believers for the equipping and expansion of the body. When all five functions operate, Jesus' lordship is visible through the whole body. When we honor and deploy all five gifts, we demonstrate his rule over our ministry.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand fivefold ministry as distributed gift
- Discover your primary and secondary APEST gifts
- Design APEST-diverse teams
- Equip others in their gifts
- Connect APEST to Jesus' lordship

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and the Fivefold Gifts (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it... So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up." —Ephesians 4:7, 11-12

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with a question: How does Jesus' lordship distribute ministry across the body?

The answer is found in Paul's letter to the Ephesians. "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it." Notice: to each one. Not to some. To each one.

Then Paul continues: "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers." These are the fivefold gifts. These are the functions Jesus gave to the church.

These are functions given to all believers. They are distributed gifts. They are for equipping.

When we confess that Jesus is Lord, we are confessing that he is Lord over our gifting. He gives gifts as he chooses. He distributes ministry as he sees fit. He equips the body as he designs.

This is why APEST is about ecosystem. It is about all people equipping. It is about distributed function.

When all five functions operate, Jesus' lordship is visible through the whole body. When we honor and deploy all five gifts, we demonstrate his rule over our ministry.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: What gift has Jesus given me? How does my gifting serve his lordship? How can I honor and partner with complementary gifts?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You give gifts to your church. You distribute ministry across the body. Teach us to discover our gifts. Teach us to honor others' gifts. Teach us to deploy all five functions. Amen.

## Main Content: The Fivefold Ecosystem (30 minutes)

### The Five Functions

Let me introduce you to the five functions. These are ministry functions. These are about what you do.

**Apostolic**: The sent, founding, extending function. Apostles are pioneers. They initiate. They extend. They plant. They multiply.

**Prophetic**: The calling, challenging, vision-casting function. Prophets are disruptors. They call. They challenge. They cast vision. They speak truth.

**Evangelistic**: The proclaiming, connecting, multiplying function. Evangelists are connectors. They proclaim. They connect. They multiply. They share good news.

**Shepherding**: The caring, protecting, nurturing function. Shepherds are carers. They care. They protect. They nurture. They tend the flock.

**Teaching**: The equipping, explaining, grounding function. Teachers are explainers. They equip. They explain. They ground. They make things clear.

### Distributed, Not Hierarchical

These functions are distributed, not hierarchical.

In most churches, we have elevated shepherding and teaching. We have professionalized them. We have made them the primary functions. We have marginalized the others.

In Ephesians 4, all five are given. All five are necessary. All five are for equipping.

When we elevate some and marginalize others, we create imbalance. We create dependency. We create weakness.

When we distribute all five, we create health. We create capacity. We create movement.

### The Ecosystem

These functions work together as an ecosystem.

An ecosystem is a web of relationships. Each part depends on the others. Each part serves the whole.

In an APEST ecosystem, apostles initiate. Prophets challenge. Evangelists connect. Shepherds care. Teachers ground. Together, they equip the body. Together, they expand the mission. Together, they demonstrate Jesus' lordship.

When one function is missing, the ecosystem is weak. When all five operate, the ecosystem is strong.

### Discovering Your Gifts

How do you discover your gifts?

The answer is found in three places: Scripture, community, and practice.

**Scripture**: Read Ephesians 4. Read about the five functions. Which one resonates? Which one describes what you do?

**Community**: Ask others. "What gift do you see in me?" Ask people who know you. Ask people who have watched you serve. They will see what you cannot see.

**Practice**: Try different functions. Serve in different ways. See what fits. See what energizes. See what multiplies.

Most people have a primary gift and a secondary gift. The primary is your dominant function. The secondary is your supporting function. Together, they shape how you serve.

### Honoring Complementary Gifts

We honor complementary gifts.

Your gift serves the whole. Others' gifts serve the whole. All gifts are necessary. All gifts serve the whole.

When we honor complementary gifts, we create synergy. Apostles need shepherds. Prophets need teachers. Evangelists need apostles. Shepherds need prophets. Teachers need evangelists.

Together, we are stronger. Together, we are more effective. Together, we demonstrate Jesus' lordship.

### Equipping, Not Performing

These functions are for equipping, not performing.

The purpose is to equip people for ministry. The purpose is to distribute function.

When we perform, we create dependency. When we equip, we create capacity. When we centralize, we create bottlenecks. When we distribute, we create multiplication.

This is the shift: from performing to equipping. From centralizing to distributing. From dependency to capacity.

## Visualization: The APEST Ecosystem

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Center**: "Jesus is Lord" with five functions radiating outward
- **Five Functions**: Arranged in a circle, each with:
  - Icon representing the function
  - Description of the function
  - Key characteristics
- **User's Gifts**: Highlight user's primary and secondary gifts
- **Team Heatmap**: Show APEST diversity in user's team/community
- **Gaps**: Highlight which functions are underrepresented
- **Synergy**: Arrows showing how functions work together
- **Equipping Flow**: Show how functions equip the body

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel like an ecosystem. Show interdependence. Show diversity. Show health.

## AI Agent Interaction: APEST Profiler (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: APEST Profiler

**Approach**: The agent helps users discover their APEST gifts and design APEST-diverse teams.

**Input**: User's service history, their passions, their strengths, their team context

**Process**:

1. **Gift Discovery**: "Tell me about how you serve. What energizes you? What multiplies?"

2. **Scripture Reflection**: "Read through the five functions. Which one resonates? Which one describes what you do?"

3. **Community Input**: "Ask 2-3 people who know you: 'What APEST gift do you see in me?' What do they say?"

4. **Primary and Secondary**: "Based on what you've shared, your primary gift appears to be [X] and your secondary appears to be [Y]. Does this fit?"

5. **Team Analysis**: "Who is on your team? What gifts do they have? What gifts are missing?"

6. **Team Design**: "How can you design for APEST diversity? How can you pair complementary gifts?"

**Output**: A personal APEST profile and a team heatmap showing diversity and gaps.

**Tone**: Exploratory, affirming, focused on discovery and team health.

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Name your primary/secondary APEST. Experiment in comfort zones."

**Rationale**: Begin with self-awareness. Learn to use your gifts in low-risk contexts.

**Field Experiment**: "Take an APEST assessment. Identify your primary gift. Try one small experiment using that gift this week."

**Steps**:
1. Take an APEST assessment (online tool or self-reflection)
2. Identify your primary gift (which function resonates?)
3. Identify your secondary gift (which function supports your primary?)
4. Try one small experiment using your primary gift (serve in a way that uses that function)
5. Document: What did you do? How did it feel? What did you learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on your primary gift
- One paragraph on your secondary gift
- One story of using your gift
- One reflection on what you learned

**Encouragement**: "You have gifts. Jesus gave them to you. Discover them. Use them. See what happens."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Plan ministry with APEST diversity in mind. Equip others in your gift."

**Rationale**: Integrate APEST thinking into ministry design. Begin equipping others.

**Field Experiment**: "Design one ministry activity with APEST diversity. Pair complementary gifts. See what happens."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one ministry activity you're planning
2. Design it with APEST diversity in mind (how can all five functions contribute?)
3. Pair complementary gifts (apostolic with shepherd, prophetic with teacher, etc.)
4. Execute the activity together
5. Debrief: What changed when we used diverse gifts? What did we learn?
6. Document: How did APEST diversity help? What did you learn about equipping?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the ministry activity
- One reflection on APEST diversity
- One story of complementary gifts working together
- One learning about equipping

**Focus**: Integrate APEST thinking. Design for diversity. Begin equipping.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Coach a new team to deploy all five voices. Rotate leadership."

**Rationale**: Multiply APEST culture through equipping. Create self-sustaining teams.

**Field Experiment**: "Facilitate a 2-week APEST sprint with a team. Rotate leadership based on gifts. See how all five functions operate."

**Steps**:
1. Identify a team that needs APEST development
2. Help them discover their gifts (assessment, reflection, community input)
3. Design a 2-week APEST sprint (mission project that requires all five functions)
4. Rotate leadership based on gifts (each function leads when their gift is needed)
5. Debrief: How did all five functions operate? What did we learn?
6. Document: How did APEST culture multiply? What did you learn about coaching teams?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the APEST sprint
- One story of all five functions operating
- One reflection on rotating leadership
- One learning about multiplying APEST culture

**Focus**: Multiply APEST culture. Coach teams. Rotate leadership.

## Integration: How APEST Connects to Lordship (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When all five functions operate, Jesus' lordship is visible through the whole body. When we honor and deploy all five gifts, we demonstrate his rule over our ministry.

This is the connection. Jesus is Lord over our gifting. He gives gifts as he chooses. He distributes ministry as he sees fit. When we honor all five, we honor his design. When we deploy all five, we demonstrate his rule.

### Reflection

How does lordship unify diversity? When we know that Jesus is Lord, we can honor different gifts. We can work together. We can serve the whole. His lordship unifies our diversity.

### Commitment

"I will honor and deploy all five gifts. I will equip others in their gifts. I will demonstrate Jesus' lordship through APEST diversity."

---

## Closing: Lordship and the Fivefold (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the question: How does Jesus' lordship distribute ministry across the body?

The answer: Jesus gives gifts to each one. He distributes ministry across the body. When all five functions operate, his lordship is visible.

APEST is about ecosystem. It is about all people equipping.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your APEST commitment]."

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You give gifts to your church. You distribute ministry across the body. Teach us to discover our gifts. Teach us to honor others' gifts. Teach us to deploy all five functions. Equip your body through us. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Discover your gifts. Honor others' gifts. Deploy all five functions. Return next week to share what you learned. The equipping begins now.

## Next Week Preview

Next week, we explore Liminality-Communitas. We will learn how Jesus' lordship forms us through risk. We will practice redemptive discomfort. We will design shared ordeals. We will build resilient community.

Our formation flows from lordship. When we choose discomfort for mission, we demonstrate Jesus' lordship over comfort. When we form communitas, we demonstrate his rule over our relationships.

Come prepared. Bring your APEST discoveries. Bring your team experiments. We will build on this foundation.
