# Week 6: Liminality

**Theme**: "Liminality-Communitas: How Jesus' Lordship Forms Us Through Risk"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with shared ordeal design

---

## Big Idea

Communitas forms in shared ordeal for God's mission. When we step into liminal space together—threshold moments of risk and uncertainty—deep bonds form. Adversity forges depth and agility. This formation flows from the confession that Jesus is Lord. When we choose discomfort for mission, we demonstrate Jesus' lordship over comfort. When we form communitas, we demonstrate his rule over our relationships.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand liminality as formational threshold
- Design shared ordeal for communitas
- Practice redemptive discomfort
- Build resilient community through risk
- Connect risk-taking to Jesus' lordship

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and Redemptive Discomfort (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.'" —Matthew 16:24

> "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance." —James 1:2-3

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with a question: How does Jesus' lordship call us into redemptive discomfort?

The answer is found in Jesus' words to his disciples: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me." This is the pattern. Following Jesus involves cross-bearing. It involves choosing discomfort. It involves stepping into risk.

When we confess that Jesus is Lord, we are receiving a call to discomfort. We are being invited into liminal space. We are being called to choose risk for the sake of mission.

This discomfort is redemptive. It is formation. It is purposeful stretch. It is shared ordeal.

When we choose discomfort for mission, we demonstrate Jesus' lordship over comfort. When we step into liminal space, we demonstrate his rule over our safety. When we form communitas through shared hardship, we demonstrate his authority over our relationships.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: What risk is Jesus inviting me to take? What discomfort am I avoiding? How does lordship call me into redemptive discomfort?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You call us to take up our cross and follow you. Teach us to embrace redemptive discomfort. Form us through shared ordeal. Build communitas through risk. Amen.

## Main Content: Risk-Forged Community (30 minutes)

### Liminality as Threshold

Liminality is a threshold. It is the space between. It is the moment of transition. It is the place where the old is ending and the new is beginning.

In liminal space, we are vulnerable. We are uncertain. We are exposed. The old structures are gone. The new structures are not yet formed. We are in between.

This is where formation happens. This is where transformation occurs. This is where we are remade.

Jesus knew this. He was tested in the wilderness. He was formed through suffering. He was perfected through what he endured (Hebrews 5:8-9).

We are formed the same way. We grow in discomfort. We mature in risk. We deepen in shared ordeal.

### Communitas vs. Community

Communitas is different from community.

Community is comfortable. Communitas is forged. Community is chosen. Communitas is formed. Community is safe. Communitas is risky.

Communitas forms when people share a mission beyond themselves. It forms when they step into liminal space together. It forms when they face shared hardship. It forms when they choose discomfort for the sake of something greater.

This is what we see in the early church. They were formed through persecution. They were bonded through shared risk. They were united through common mission. They were communitas.

### Redemptive Discomfort

This discomfort is redemptive. It is formation.

God uses suffering to form us. God allows hardship to shape us.

This is the pattern of the cross. Jesus suffered because God was forming. The cross was redemption. The suffering was purposeful.

When we choose discomfort for mission, we participate in this pattern. We are choosing purposeful stretch. We are embracing redemptive discomfort. We are being formed through shared ordeal.

### Designing Shared Ordeal

We design shared ordeal. We choose purposeful stretch.

A shared ordeal is a time-bound, mission-focused challenge that requires interdependence. It is shared hardship. It is time-bound. It is purposeful.

Examples: A mission trip that requires everyone to contribute. A service project that stretches everyone. A learning challenge that requires collaboration. A risk that cannot be taken alone.

When we design shared ordeal, we create conditions for communitas. We create space for deep bonds. We create opportunity for formation.

### Non-Anxious Presence

We practice non-anxious presence in the storm.

When we step into liminal space, we will feel fear. We will feel uncertainty. We will feel vulnerability. This is normal. This is expected.

We practice non-anxious presence. We acknowledge the fear. We name the uncertainty. We embrace the vulnerability. We do not let it control us. We trust. We hope. We love.

This is what Jesus did. In the garden, he was anxious. He was troubled. He was vulnerable. He did not let it control him. He submitted. He trusted. He obeyed.

We do the same. We feel the fear. We name the uncertainty. We embrace the vulnerability. We submit to Jesus' lordship. We trust his presence. We obey his call.

### Resilience Through Risk

We build resilience through risk.

When we step into liminal space and survive, we become more resilient. When we face shared hardship and endure, we become stronger. When we choose discomfort and grow, we become more capable.

This resilience is communal. It is systemic. When a community faces shared ordeal and endures, the whole community becomes more resilient.

This is what we see in movements. They are formed in risk. They are built in liminality. They are sustained in resilience.

## Visualization: The Threshold Doorframe

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Doorframe**: A threshold with two sides
- **Side 1 (Comfort Zone)**: "Where we are" - safety, predictability, control
- **Side 2 (Liminal Space)**: "Where we're going" - risk, uncertainty, vulnerability
- **The Threshold**: The moment of stepping through
- **Communitas**: People stepping through together, holding hands, supporting each other
- **Mission**: The purpose that draws them through (visible on the other side)
- **Formation**: Arrows showing how stepping through forms them
- **Resilience**: Visual showing how they become stronger through the process

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel like a journey. Show movement. Show togetherness. Show purpose. Make it feel like courage.

## AI Agent Interaction: Risk Planner (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: Risk Planner

**Approach**: The agent helps users identify appropriate stretch and design shared ordeal.

**Input**: User's current comfort zone, their fears, their mission context, their relationships

**Process**:

1. **Fear Assessment**: "What fears do you face when you think about taking risks? What discomfort are you avoiding?"

2. **Mission Alignment**: "What risks align with your mission? What discomfort serves God's purposes?"

3. **Appropriate Stretch**: "What would be an appropriate stretch for you? Not too small (no growth) and not too large (overwhelming)."

4. **Shared Ordeal Design**: "Who could join you in this? How can you make it shared? How can you create interdependence?"

5. **Time-Bound Planning**: "How long will this last? What are the boundaries? How will you know when it's done?"

6. **Debrief Planning**: "How will you process this together? When will you debrief? What will you learn?"

**Output**: A shared ordeal plan with appropriate stretch, shared participation, time boundaries, and debrief process.

**Tone**: Supportive, challenging, focused on appropriate stretch and shared formation.

---

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Short-term stretch with clear boundaries and debrief partner."

**Rationale**: Begin with manageable risk. Learn to step into discomfort with support.

**Field Experiment**: "Choose one appropriate stretch this week. Do it with a partner. Debrief together within 24 hours."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one appropriate stretch (conversation you've been avoiding, service that makes you uncomfortable, invitation that requires courage)
2. Identify one partner (someone who will support you, someone who will debrief with you)
3. Take the stretch together (or support each other in taking it)
4. Debrief within 24 hours: What happened? How did you feel? What did you learn?
5. Document: What was the stretch? What did you learn? How did the partner help?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the stretch you chose
- One reflection on how you felt
- One learning from the experience
- One reflection on how the partner helped

**Encouragement**: "You are learning to step into discomfort with support. This is the beginning of resilience."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Commit to a stretch requiring interdependence for 4-6 weeks."

**Rationale**: Build communitas through shared ordeal. Create conditions for deep bonds.

**Field Experiment**: "Design and execute a 4-week shared stretch with 2-3 others. Mission-focused. Time-bound. Interdependent."

**Steps**:
1. Identify 2-3 others who will join you
2. Design a shared stretch (mission project, learning challenge, service commitment that requires everyone)
3. Commit to 4-6 weeks together
4. Execute the stretch: Show up. Support each other. Face the discomfort together.
5. Debrief weekly: What happened? How did we grow? What did we learn?
6. Document: How did communitas form? What bonds were created? What did you learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the shared stretch
- One story of communitas formation
- One reflection on how interdependence helped
- One learning about resilience

**Focus**: Create communitas through shared ordeal. Build bonds through mission. Form resilience through risk.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Plan for challenge. Rituals of commissioning and debrief. Safeguard people."

**Rationale**: Multiply communitas through intentional design. Form others through shared ordeal.

**Field Experiment**: "Design and facilitate a shared ordeal for a team or community. Include commissioning and debrief rituals. Safeguard people."

**Steps**:
1. Identify a team or community that needs formation
2. Design a shared ordeal (mission challenge, learning stretch, service project that forms them)
3. Create commissioning ritual: Bless them. Send them. Pray for them.
4. Facilitate the ordeal: Support them. Check in. Safeguard them.
5. Create debrief ritual: Process together. Celebrate growth. Learn together.
6. Document: How did communitas form? How did people grow? What did you learn about facilitating formation?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on the shared ordeal you designed
- One story of communitas formation
- One reflection on how rituals helped
- One learning about facilitating formation

**Focus**: Multiply communitas. Form others through shared ordeal. Design for resilience.

## Integration: How Risk Connects to Lordship (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When we choose discomfort for mission, we demonstrate Jesus' lordship over comfort. When we step into liminal space, we demonstrate his rule over our safety. When we form communitas, we demonstrate his authority over our relationships.

This is the connection. Jesus is Lord over our comfort. He is Lord over our safety. He is Lord over our relationships. When we choose risk for his sake, we demonstrate his lordship. When we form communitas through shared ordeal, we demonstrate his rule.

### Reflection

How does lordship sustain us in liminal spaces? When we know that Jesus is Lord, we can step into uncertainty. We can face discomfort. We can embrace vulnerability. We trust his presence. We hope in his purpose. We love through his power.

### Commitment

"I will embrace redemptive discomfort. I will form communitas through shared ordeal. I will demonstrate Jesus' lordship through risk."

---

## Closing: Lordship and Formation (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the question: How does Jesus' lordship call us into redemptive discomfort?

The answer: We choose risk because Jesus is Lord. We form communitas because he forms us. We build resilience because he sustains us.

Liminality is formational. Communitas is forged. Resilience is built through risk.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your risk commitment]."

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You call us to take up our cross and follow you. Form us through shared ordeal. Build communitas through risk. Sustain us through your presence. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Step into one appropriate stretch. Form communitas through shared ordeal. Return next week to share what you learned. The formation begins now.

## Next Week Preview

Next week, we explore Organic Systems. We will learn how Jesus' lordship organizes for movement. We will design simple, reproducible patterns. We will push authority to edges. We will install feedback loops.

Our systems flow from lordship. Jesus designed simple patterns. He pushed authority outward. When systems multiply, his lordship extends.

Come prepared. Bring your risk stories. Bring your communitas experiences. We will build on this foundation.
