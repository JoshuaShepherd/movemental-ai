# Week 7: Organic Systems

**Theme**: "Organic Systems: How Jesus' Lordship Organizes for Movement"  
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with system design practice

---

## Big Idea

Jesus designed simple, reproducible patterns. Movement-friendly organization is simple, reproducible, and decentralized. Authority and function push to the edges. Feedback loops foster learning. The macro exists in the micro—the tree in the seed. When systems multiply, Jesus' lordship extends. When we design for simplicity, we honor his pattern. When we decentralize, we demonstrate his trust in the body.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand organic vs. institutional systems
- Design simple, reproducible patterns
- Push authority to edges (decentralization)
- Install feedback loops for learning
- Connect system design to Jesus' lordship

## Opening: Jesus is Lord and System Design (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "He told them another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.'" —Matthew 13:31-32

> "He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.'" —Mark 4:26-27

### Teaching Content

Friends, we begin this week with a question: How does Jesus' lordship shape our organizational structures?

The answer is found in Jesus' parables. The kingdom is like a mustard seed. It is small. It is simple. But it grows. It multiplies. It becomes a tree.

The kingdom is like seed scattered on the ground. It sprouts and grows. The farmer does not know how. The growth happens. The multiplication occurs.

This is the pattern: simple, reproducible, organic. The seed contains the tree. The micro mirrors the macro. The small multiplies into the large.

When we confess that Jesus is Lord, we are confessing that he is Lord over our systems. He designed simple patterns. He created reproducible structures. He enabled multiplication.

This is why organic systems matter. They are simple enough to reproduce. They are decentralized enough to multiply. They are flexible enough to adapt. They are resilient enough to endure.

When systems multiply, Jesus' lordship extends. When we design for simplicity, we honor his pattern. When we decentralize, we demonstrate his trust in the body.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: What would Jesus' lordship look like in our systems? How can we design for simplicity? How can we push authority to edges?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You designed simple patterns. You created reproducible structures. Teach us to design for simplicity. Teach us to decentralize. Teach us to multiply. Amen.

## Main Content: Movemental Organization (30 minutes)

### Simple and Reproducible

Movement-friendly organization is simple. It is reproducible. It does not require experts. It does not require resources. It does not require programs.

Think of the early church. They met in homes. They broke bread together. They prayed together. They shared everything in common. The pattern was simple. It was reproducible. It multiplied.

Think of Jesus' instructions to his disciples. "Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money" (Luke 9:3). The mission is simple. It is reproducible. It does not depend on resources.

This is the test: Can a new believer reproduce this? Can a busy parent do this? Can a bi-vocational leader sustain this? If the answer is yes, we have created something that can multiply.

### Decentralization

We push authority to the edges.

In most organizations, authority is centralized. Decisions are made at the top. Resources are controlled at the center. Knowledge is held by experts.

This creates bottlenecks. It creates dependency. It creates fragility.

When we decentralize, we push authority outward. We push decisions to those closest to mission. We push resources to those doing the work. We push knowledge to those who need it.

This is the pattern of Jesus. He distributed. He trusted. He gave.

When we decentralize, we demonstrate Jesus' trust in the body. We show that we believe the Spirit is in all of us. We enable multiplication.

### Feedback Loops

We install feedback loops.

A feedback loop is a cycle: sense, decide, act, learn. We sense what is happening. We decide what to do. We act on that decision. We learn from what happened. Then we repeat.

Feedback loops enable learning. They enable adaptation. They enable improvement.

Without feedback loops, we repeat mistakes. We do not learn. We do not adapt. We do not improve.

With feedback loops, we learn fast. We adapt quickly. We improve continuously.

### The Starfish and the Spider

A helpful metaphor: the starfish and the spider.

A spider has a head. Cut off the head, and the spider dies. The spider is centralized. It is fragile.

A starfish has no head. Cut off an arm, and it grows back. Cut the starfish in half, and you get two starfish. The starfish is decentralized. It is resilient.

Jesus movements are like starfish. They are decentralized. They are resilient. They multiply when cut. They survive when parts are removed.

Institutional churches are like spiders. They are centralized. They are fragile. They die when the head is cut off. They collapse when the center fails.

### The Tree in the Seed

The macro exists in the micro.

A seed contains a tree. The DNA is there. The pattern is present. When conditions are right, the seed becomes a tree.

This is the pattern of mDNA. The six elements are present at every scale. The individual disciple has mDNA. The small group has mDNA. The church has mDNA. The movement has mDNA.

The pattern repeats. The micro mirrors the macro. The small contains the large.

When we design systems, we design for this pattern. We create simple structures that repeat at every scale. We enable the micro to become the macro.

### Knowledge Democratization

We democratize knowledge.

In most organizations, knowledge is held by experts. It is centralized. It is controlled.

This creates dependency. It creates bottlenecks. It prevents multiplication.

When we democratize knowledge, we share it widely. We make it accessible. We enable everyone to learn. We enable everyone to lead.

This is the pattern of Jesus. He shared it. He taught openly. He created capacity.

When we democratize knowledge, we enable multiplication. We create capacity. We demonstrate Jesus' trust in the body.

## Visualization: The Organic System

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page schematic showing:

- **Center**: "Jesus is Lord" with simple patterns radiating outward
- **Seed/Tree Metaphor**: Show how the seed contains the tree
- **Starfish Pattern**: Show decentralized structure (no head, arms can regenerate)
- **Feedback Loops**: Show sense-decide-act-learn cycles
- **Micro to Macro**: Show how patterns repeat at every scale
- **User's Current System**: Show their current structure (centralized or decentralized?)
- **Simplification Opportunity**: Show what could be simplified
- **Decentralization Opportunity**: Show where authority could be pushed outward

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel organic. Show growth. Show multiplication. Show resilience.

## AI Agent Interaction: Loop Builder (10-15 minutes)

**Agent Name**: Loop Builder

**Approach**: The agent helps users design simple systems with feedback loops.

**Input**: User's current systems, their complexity, their feedback mechanisms, their multiplication goals

**Process**:

1. **System Audit**: "Tell me about your current systems. What is working? What is complex? What is not multiplying?"

2. **Simplicity Check**: "Can a new believer reproduce this? Can a busy parent do this? If not, how can we simplify?"

3. **Decentralization Assessment**: "Where is authority centralized? Where could it be pushed outward?"

4. **Feedback Loop Design**: "How do you learn from what you do? How can you install feedback loops?"

5. **Simplification Plan**: "What can you simplify? What can you remove? What can you make more reproducible?"

6. **Implementation Steps**: "What is one system you can redesign this week? What is one feedback loop you can install?"

**Output**: A system simplification plan with feedback loops and decentralization steps.

**Tone**: Practical, focused on simplicity and reproducibility.

## Level-Adaptive Practices

### For Level 1-2 (Dormant-to-Awakening)

**Practice**: "Adopt one simple weekly mission rhythm with review."

**Rationale**: Begin with one reproducible pattern. Learn to review and learn.

**Field Experiment**: "Design and implement one simple weekly rhythm. Review weekly for 4 weeks. See what you learn."

**Steps**:
1. Design one simple weekly rhythm (pray, presence, practice - choose one)
2. Implement it for 4 weeks
3. Review weekly: What worked? What didn't? What did you learn?
4. Adjust based on learning
5. Document: What is the rhythm? How is it reproducible? What did you learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One paragraph on your weekly rhythm
- One reflection on what you learned
- One adjustment you made
- One reflection on reproducibility

**Encouragement**: "Start simple. One rhythm. One week. Review. Learn. Adjust. This is how systems form."

### For Level 3 (Integrating)

**Practice**: "Create a one-page 'how to' others can use without you."

**Rationale**: Make patterns transferable. Design for multiplication.

**Field Experiment**: "Document one ministry practice in a one-page guide. Teach it to someone else. Gather feedback."

**Steps**:
1. Identify one ministry practice you do regularly
2. Document it in a one-page guide (simple steps, anyone can follow)
3. Test it: Can a new believer do this? Can a busy parent do this?
4. Teach it to someone else
5. Gather feedback: What worked? What was confusing? How can we improve?
6. Refine the guide based on feedback
7. Document: What is the guide? How did teaching go? What did you learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One-page guide you created
- One story of teaching it to someone
- One piece of feedback you received
- One reflection on what you learned

**Focus**: Make patterns transferable. Design for multiplication. Enable others to do what you do.

### For Level 4-5 (Reproducing-to-Movemental)

**Practice**: "Build community dashboards for shared learning. Stories over stats."

**Rationale**: Multiply learning through shared feedback. Create systems that learn.

**Field Experiment**: "Create a simple dashboard for your community. Share monthly. Focus on stories, not just numbers."

**Steps**:
1. Identify what your community needs to learn (what questions do we need to answer?)
2. Design a simple dashboard (one page, visual, easy to understand)
3. Focus on stories, not just stats (what stories show what we're learning?)
4. Share monthly with your community
5. Gather feedback: What did we learn? What questions do we have? What should we adjust?
6. Iterate: Improve the dashboard based on learning
7. Document: What is the dashboard? How did sharing go? What did the community learn?

**Evidence to Collect**:
- One dashboard you created
- One story from the dashboard
- One learning from the community
- One reflection on how shared learning multiplied

**Focus**: Multiply learning. Create systems that learn. Enable community-wide improvement.

## Integration: How Systems Connect to Lordship (5 minutes)

### Teaching Content

When systems multiply, Jesus' lordship extends. When we design for simplicity, we honor his pattern. When we decentralize, we demonstrate his trust in the body.

This is the connection. Jesus is Lord over our systems. He designed simple patterns. He created reproducible structures. When we follow his pattern, we enable multiplication. When we trust the body, we demonstrate his rule.

### Reflection

How does lordship prevent institutional drift? When we know that Jesus is Lord, we keep systems simple. We push authority outward. We enable multiplication. His lordship keeps us focused on movement.

### Commitment

"I will design systems that extend Jesus' lordship. I will simplify. I will decentralize. I will multiply."

## Closing: Lordship and System Design (5 minutes)

### Recapitulation

We began with the question: How does Jesus' lordship shape our organizational structures?

The answer: Jesus designed simple patterns. He created reproducible structures. When we follow his pattern, we enable multiplication.

Organic systems are simple. They are reproducible. They are decentralized. They multiply.

### Commitment

Take a moment. Write one sentence: "Because Jesus is Lord, I will [your system commitment]."

### Prayer

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You designed simple patterns. You created reproducible structures. Teach us to simplify. Teach us to decentralize. Teach us to multiply. Help us organize for movement. Amen.

### Blessing

Go in the name of Jesus, who is Lord. Simplify one system. Install one feedback loop. Push one decision outward. Return next week to share what you learned. The multiplication begins now.
