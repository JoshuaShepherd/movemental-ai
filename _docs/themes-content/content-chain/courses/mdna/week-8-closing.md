# Week 8: Closing

**Theme**: "Commissioning: Living Under Jesus' Lordship in Movement"  
**Duration**: 90-120 minutes  
**Type**: Video-led with final assessment and commissioning ceremony

---

## Big Idea

We end where we began: Jesus is Lord. All six elements flow from and return to his lordship. All formation flows to multiplication. All maturity flows to movement. When we multiply, we extend his lordship. When we commission, we send. When we continue, we trust the Spirit to form what we cannot manufacture.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this week, you will:

- Compare final assessment to baseline and celebrate level advancement
- Design ongoing formation pathway
- Commit to multiplication
- Receive commissioning
- Connect formation to movement

## Opening: We End Where We Began (5 minutes)

### Scripture Anchor

> "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'" —Matthew 28:18-20

> "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." —Acts 1:8

### Teaching Content

Friends, we end where we began: with the confession that Jesus is Lord.

Eight weeks ago, we started here. We met you where you are, exploring the mDNA maturity model and orienting to Jesus' lordship. We designed our formation pathway with lordship as the center. We practiced with lordship as our guide.

Now we return here. We have explored all six elements. We have practiced. We have grown. We have integrated. We have multiplied.

The center remains: Jesus is Lord. All six elements flow from him. All formation flows to him. All multiplication extends his rule.

This is a commissioning. This is a continuation. This is a starting point.

When we multiply, we extend his lordship. When we commission, we send. When we continue, we trust the Spirit to form what we cannot manufacture.

### Reflection Prompt

Take a moment. Ask yourself: How has Jesus' lordship deepened through this journey? How will you continue to live under his lordship? How will you multiply what you've learned?

### Prayer of Submission

Lord Jesus, you are Lord. You have been with us through this journey. You have formed us. You have multiplied us. Now commission us. Send us. Multiply your lordship through us. Amen.

## Main Content: From Formation to Movement (40 minutes)

### The Journey We've Taken

Let me remind you of the journey we've taken.

**Week 1**: We began by meeting you where you are. We explored the mDNA maturity model. We oriented to Jesus' lordship. We primed for the journey ahead.

**Week 2**: We dove deep into "Jesus is Lord" as the organizing center. We learned centered-set thinking. We removed queen pieces. We decentralized for movement.

**Week 3**: We explored missional-incarnational impulse. We learned to go and embed. We practiced contextualization. We extended lordship through presence.

**Week 4**: We explored disciple making. We learned to think in generations. We designed simple, reproducible pathways. We extended lordship through multiplication.

**Week 5**: We explored APEST. We discovered our gifts. We designed APEST-diverse teams. We extended lordship through equipping.

**Week 6**: We explored liminality-communitas. We learned to embrace redemptive discomfort. We formed communitas through shared ordeal. We extended lordship through risk.

**Week 7**: We explored organic systems. We learned to simplify. We decentralized. We extended lordship through multiplication.

**Week 8**: We close and commission. We celebrate. We commit. We multiply.

### Level Advancement

Level advancement is worth celebrating.

Some of you have advanced one level in your limiting factor. Some of you have advanced one level in multiple elements. Some of you have advanced your overall maturity level.

This is formation happening. This is the Spirit at work. This is lordship taking root.

Level advancement is a sign. It is evidence. It is fruit. The end is movement. The end is multiplication. The end is Jesus' lordship extending through generations.

### Observable Indicators

Observable indicators matter more than assessment scores.

Assessment scores tell us something. Observable indicators tell us everything.

Can you identify someone you are discipling? Can you identify someone they are discipling? This is observable. This is evidence. This is multiplication.

Do neighbors name you as "one of us"? Do you show up in the same place at the same time? This is observable. This is evidence. This is presence.

Have you formed communitas through shared ordeal? Have you faced risk together? This is observable. This is evidence. This is formation.

Assessment scores are helpful. Observable indicators are definitive. They show that formation is happening. They show that lordship is taking root. They show that movement is beginning.

### The Ongoing Pathway

This is a commissioning.

You have completed eight weeks of formation. Formation continues. The journey continues. The movement continues.

Now you design your ongoing pathway. What will you continue? What will you start? What will you stop? How will you multiply?

This is your 90-day plan. This is your next season. This is your ongoing formation.

It all flows from lordship. It all returns to lordship. Lordship is the center. Formation flows from there.

### Multiplication Commitment

We commit to multiplication.

This is movement multiplication. This is generational formation. This is movemental capacity.

When we commit to multiplication, we commit to discipling others. We commit to equipping others. We commit to multiplying what we've learned.

This is the Great Commission. This is the multiplication mandate. This is the movement imperative.

### Commissioning

We commission you.

You have been formed. You have grown. You have integrated. Now you are commissioned. You are sent. You are multiplied.

This is a commissioning. This is a continuation. This is a starting point.

Go. Multiply. Extend Jesus' lordship. Trust the Spirit to form what you cannot manufacture.

## Visualization: The Formation Journey

**Visual Description for Design Team**:

Create a one-page visualization showing:

- **The Journey**: A path from Week 1 to Week 8
- **Milestones**: Key moments along the way (each week marked)
- **Level Advancement**: Visual showing progress (before/after levels)
- **Observable Indicators**: Icons or notes showing evidence of growth
- **Limiting Factor Evolution**: How the limiting factor changed
- **Multiplication Evidence**: Where multiplication is happening
- **Ongoing Pathway**: Arrow showing continuation beyond Week 8
- **Commissioning**: Visual element showing sending/commissioning

**Design Notes**: The visualization should feel like a journey. Show progress. Celebrate growth. Point forward. Make it feel like commissioning.

## Final Assessment Process (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Reassess (15 minutes)

Take the full assessment one final time. All 30 questions. All six elements. Answer honestly. See where you are now.

### Step 2: Compare (10 minutes)

Compare Week 8 results to:
- Week 1 baseline
- See your full journey

Identify:
- Level advancement (where did you advance?)
- Observable indicators (what evidence do you have?)
- Ongoing growth edges (where do you still need to grow?)

### Step 3: Celebrate (5 minutes)

Celebrate your growth:
- What are you celebrating?
- What surprised you?
- Where is Jesus' lordship most evident?
- What evidence of multiplication do you have?

1. **Celebration**: "Let's celebrate your growth. What are you most excited about? What evidence of formation do you have?"

2. **Level Advancement Review**: "You advanced from Level [X] to Level [Y] in [Element]. What does that mean? What evidence do you have?"

3. **Observable Indicators**: "Beyond assessment scores, what observable indicators do you have? Can you identify someone you're discipling? Can you trace generations?"

4. **Ongoing Pathway Design**: "What will you continue? What will you start? What will you stop? Let's design your 90-day pathway."

5. **Multiplication Commitment**: "How will you multiply what you've learned? Who will you disciple? Who will you equip? How will you extend Jesus' lordship?"

6. **Commissioning**: "You are commissioned. You are sent. You are multiplied. How will you continue? What is your next step?"

**Output**: A 90-day formation pathway and a multiplication commitment plan.

**Tone**: Celebratory, forward-looking, focused on multiplication and commissioning.
