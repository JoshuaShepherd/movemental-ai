# Movement Course Adaptation Prompt
## Transforming Movement-Ology Book Content into an 8-Week Course

---

## Purpose

This prompt provides comprehensive guidance for adapting the book-length "Movement-Ology: Systems Thinking for Advanced Movement Leadership" content into an 8-week course structure, following the same framework, approach, and pedagogical design as the mDNA Primer course.

---

## Core Course Structure

### Week/Module Organization

Each week follows this consistent file structure:

```
movement-course/
  course/
    week-01/
      anchor-scripture.md
      reading.md
      agentic-conversation.md
      reflection.md
      looking-ahead.md (or journey-continues.md for week 08)
      video.md (optional)
    week-02/
      [same structure]
    ...
    week-08/
      [same structure, but journey-continues.md instead of looking-ahead.md]
```

## Structural Requirements

### Each Week Must:

1. **Connect to Previous Weeks**: Reference earlier content, build on concepts
2. **Connect to "Christology Begets Movement"**: Every week returns to theological foundation
3. **Maintain System Awareness**: While exploring specific topics, remember the whole system
4. **Include Practical Application**: Not just theory, but actionable insights
5. **Include Stories and Examples**: Historical movements, contemporary examples
6. **Set Up Next Week**: Create anticipation and connection (except week 8)

### Content Flow Within Each Week:

1. **Anchor Scripture** → Grounds the week theologically
2. **Reading** → Main content, builds concepts progressively
3. **Agentic Conversation** → Personalized discovery of next steps
4. **Reflection** → Integration and application
5. **Looking Ahead** → Transition and anticipation

---

## Adaptation Principles

### When Condensing Content:

1. **Prioritize Core Concepts**: Essential systems thinking principles over exhaustive detail
2. **Maintain Theological Depth**: Don't sacrifice theological grounding for brevity
3. **Use Examples Strategically**: Choose best examples that illustrate multiple points
4. **Preserve Voice**: Keep Alan's distinctive voice and style
5. **Maintain Progression**: Build concepts week by week, don't assume prior knowledge
6. **Balance Theory and Practice**: Each week should have both understanding and application

### When Combining Chapters:

1. **Find Thematic Unity**: Look for natural connections between chapters
2. **Create Narrative Flow**: Weeks should tell a story, not just cover topics
3. **Maintain Balance**: Don't overload any single week
4. **Preserve Key Insights**: Don't lose critical concepts in consolidation
5. **Ensure Completeness**: All major themes from source material should appear somewhere

### When Adapting Advanced Content:

1. **Assume Some Familiarity**: Readers may know mDNA, APEST, but not systems thinking
2. **Build Systems Literacy**: Introduce systems concepts progressively
3. **Connect to Known Frameworks**: Link systems thinking to familiar Hirsch concepts
4. **Provide Context**: Explain why systems thinking matters for movement leaders
5. **Make It Practical**: Always connect to real movement challenges

---

## Agentic Conversation Design

### Purpose:
Help participants discover personalized next steps based on how the week's content intersects with their specific context and journey.

### Structure:
- **Focus Statement**: What this conversation aims to accomplish
- **Sample Prompts**: 4-6 example questions the AI might ask
- **Conversation Objectives**: What participants should discover through the conversation

### Design Principles:

1. **Personalized**: Questions adapt to participant's context
2. **Action-Oriented**: Leads to concrete next steps, not just discussion
3. **Contextual**: Considers their movement, role, challenges
4. **Discovery-Based**: Helps them discover insights, not just receive information
5. **Integration-Focused**: Connects week's content to their actual situation

### Example Framework:

**Focus:** Helps participants identify [specific outcome related to week's content]

**Sample Prompts:**
- [Question that helps them assess their current state]
- [Question that helps them identify gaps or opportunities]
- [Question that helps them discover next steps]
- [Question that helps them overcome obstacles]

---

## Reflection Questions Design

### Purpose:
Structured questions that help participants process, integrate, and apply the week's content to their personal and community context.

### Structure:
5-7 questions per week, typically including:
1. **Assessment Question**: Where are you/your movement in relation to this content?
2. **Identification Question**: What do you see? What's present? What's missing?
3. **Implication Question**: What does this mean for you/your context?
4. **Application Question**: What would it look like to apply this?
5. **Obstacle Question**: What stands in the way? What needs to change?
6. **Action Question**: What's your next step? What will you do?
7. **Integration Question**: How does this connect to previous weeks? To the whole?

### Design Principles:

1. **Open-Ended**: Questions that require thought, not just yes/no answers
2. **Personal**: Connect to their actual experience and context
3. **Action-Oriented**: Lead toward concrete application
4. **Progressive**: Build on previous weeks' reflections
5. **Integrative**: Connect to whole course, not just this week

## Special Considerations

### Advanced Content Adaptation:

The Movement-Ology book assumes readers already know mDNA, APEST, Metanoia Journey, etc. The course should:

1. **Briefly Reference**: Don't re-explain, but acknowledge familiarity
2. **Build On**: Assume knowledge and build systems thinking on top
3. **Connect**: Show how systems thinking enhances understanding of known frameworks
4. **Extend**: Take familiar concepts deeper through systems lens

### Systems Thinking Introduction:

For readers new to systems thinking:

1. **Introduce Gradually**: Don't overwhelm in week 1
2. **Use Familiar Language**: Connect to movement concepts they know
3. **Provide Examples**: Show systems thinking in action
4. **Build Vocabulary**: Introduce terms progressively
5. **Make It Practical**: Always show why it matters for their work

### Length Management:

With 16 chapters to condense into 8 weeks:

1. **Prioritize**: What's most essential for movement leaders?
2. **Synthesize**: Combine related concepts
3. **Streamline**: Remove redundancy
4. **Focus**: Each week has clear focus, not trying to cover everything
5. **Reference**: Point to source material for deeper study

---

## Final Notes

This course adaptation should feel like a natural extension of the mDNA Primer course—same structure, same approach, same pedagogical philosophy, but applied to the advanced systems thinking content of Movement-Ology.

The goal is not to simplify the advanced content, but to make it accessible through the proven course structure. Participants should finish the course equipped to think systemically about their movements, understand leverage points, read system signals, and intervene effectively in movement systems.

Remember: This is about **remembering and reactivating** movement systems thinking, not just learning new concepts. The course should help movement leaders see their movements through new eyes—system eyes—and equip them to architect movement systems that multiply and maintain DNA.

Everything flows from Christology. Everything connects to movement. Everything serves the mission.
