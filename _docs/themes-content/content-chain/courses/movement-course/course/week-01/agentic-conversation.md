# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you are in your journey and what questions you're bringing.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify where they are in their systems thinking journey—new discovery or metanoia moment? What questions are they bringing? How do they currently think about their movement? What system challenges are they facing?

**Sample Prompts:**
- What brought you to this moment? What questions are you carrying about movement systems?
- Are you discovering systems thinking for the first time, or are you coming back to it for metanoia—deep rethinking about how movements actually work?
- How do you currently think about your movement? Do you see it as a system, or do you think about it in other ways?
- What system challenges are you facing? Where do you see unintended consequences from your interventions?
- Where do you see movement systems already functioning well in your context? Where do you see institutional systems that might be preventing movement?
- What would it mean for you to think systemically about your movement? How would that change your approach to leadership?

**Conversation Objectives:**
- Participants discover their current level of systems awareness
- Participants identify specific system challenges they're facing
- Participants recognize the difference between thinking about movements as machines vs. systems
- Participants begin to see their movement through a systems lens
- Participants identify one concrete area where systems thinking could help them
