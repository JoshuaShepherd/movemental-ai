# Anchor Scripture: Colossians 1:15-20

> "The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross."  
> —Colossians 1:15-20

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we dive into the content of this week, I want to invite you to spend a few minutes with this passage from Colossians. It's one of the most profound statements about Christ in all of Scripture, and it contains everything we need to understand about movement systems.

Take a moment. Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*The Son is the image of the invisible God...*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the phrase "in him all things were created." What does it mean that all things—including movement systems—were created through him? What is the source? What is the origin?

Read it a third time, focusing on "in him all things hold together." What does it mean that movement systems hold together in Christ? What is the means? What is the pathway?

Read it one more time, focusing on "for him all things were created." What does it mean that movement systems exist for Christ? What is the purpose? What is the end?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just movement systems, not just organizational theory, not just strategic frameworks. We're exploring what it means that everything—including movement systems—comes from him, through him, and for him. And if that's true, then what does it mean for how we understand and lead movements? What does it mean for you?

Because here's what I want you to see: if movement systems are created through Christ and hold together in Christ, then understanding movement systems is not just organizational work. It's theological work. It's participating in the work of the one through whom all things were created and in whom all things hold together.

Everything flows from him. Everything comes through him. Everything is for him.

Even movement systems. Especially movement systems.
