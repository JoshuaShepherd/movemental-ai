# Week 1: Introduction—This Moment, Movement Systems

## This Moment

This is a moment. I want to start there, because I think it matters.

It's a moment in the world when everything seems to be shifting. When old certainties are crumbling. When the church finds itself in a new kind of exile—not from buildings or programs necessarily, but from the cultural center it once occupied. We're not being persecuted in the way the early church was, or the Chinese underground church was. But we're being marginalized. We're being ignored. We're being dismissed as irrelevant, outdated, out of touch.

And this is also a moment for movement leaders. A moment when, if you've been leading movements for any length of time, you've probably experienced this: you make a change in one area, and something unexpected happens in another. You focus on improving discipleship, and suddenly mission engagement drops. You invest in multiplication, and DNA coherence starts to suffer. You add structure to support growth, and movemental energy begins to wane.

What's going on here? Why do our well-intentioned interventions sometimes produce unintended consequences? Why do movements respond in ways that seem counterintuitive or even perverse?

The answer, I believe, is that we're thinking about movements as if they were machines—linear, predictable, controllable. But movements aren't machines. They're **systems**—complex, interconnected, dynamic, living systems. And systems think differently than we do.

This is why advanced movement leaders need systems literacy. Not as a replacement for theological understanding, but as an essential tool for understanding how movement systems actually work. If movement flows from Christology—if it's the apostolic form of the church—then understanding movement systems is essential for stewarding what God is doing in the world.

## The Theological Foundation: Christology Begets Movement

If you've been tracking with the conversation about how Christology determines missiology, and missiology determines ecclesiology, then perhaps you've already sensed what I'm about to propose: that this theological logic doesn't stop at ecclesiology. That it extends further. That **Christology begets movement**.

This is not merely an extension of an existing formula. This is movement-ology—the recognition that movement itself is a theological category, not just an organizational outcome. Movement is the apostolic form that flows from who Jesus is and what he came to do. And if we're going to lead movements well at the systems level, we need to understand them at the theological level first.

Let me say it plainly: **Movement is the apostolic form of the church**. It's not an optional extra. It's not a strategy we adopt. It's the form the church takes when Christology and missiology are fully integrated and expressed.

Think about it this way: Jesus didn't write books. He didn't build buildings. He didn't create institutions. He didn't even leave behind a detailed organizational structure or a comprehensive strategic plan.

What did he do? He made disciples. He started a movement. He set in motion something that would multiply and spread and transform the world—not through organizational control but through DNA transmission, not through institutional maintenance but through relational reproduction.

And here's what's remarkable: the movement Jesus started had all the characteristics we've identified in Apostolic Genius and movement DNA. It had the central confession ("You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God"). It had disciple-making at its core. It had a missional-incarnational impulse (Jesus going to where people were, becoming one of us, dwelling among us). It had all five APEST functions operating. It had organic, reproducible systems. It had communitas—that deep sense of comradeship forged in shared adventure and risk.

Jesus didn't just teach about movement. He *embodied* movement. He *was* movement.

But here's what I want you to see: Jesus didn't do this accidentally or incidentally. He did it because of *who he is*. Movement flows from Christology because movement is consistent with the nature of the one who is sent, who multiplies, who extends, who reproduces.

Think about it this way: Jesus is the incarnate Word, the one through whom all things were created and through whom all things hold together (Colossians 1:16-17). He is the Logos—not just a principle or an idea, but a person, a dynamic reality, a creative and redemptive force that is inherently generative, inherently multiplying, inherently extending.

When Jesus calls disciples, he's not just gathering followers. He's extending his own ministry. He's multiplying his own presence. He's reproducing his own mission. And when he sends them out, he's not just delegating tasks—he's releasing movement, activating reproduction, unleashing multiplication.

This is why movement is theological before it's organizational. Movement flows from the nature of Christ himself. It's built into the logic of incarnation, the dynamic of mission, the structure of the kingdom.

## Why Systems Thinking?

But here's the thing: if movement flows from Christology, then understanding how movement systems work is part of stewarding that theological reality. And this is where systems thinking comes in.

Let me be direct here: most of us have been trained to think analytically, not systemically. We've been taught to break things down into their component parts, to isolate variables, to think in linear cause-and-effect relationships. This works well for simple problems—if the light doesn't work, check the bulb. But it fails miserably when we're dealing with complex, adaptive systems like movements.

Movement leaders face complex challenges: maintaining DNA coherence across multiple cities, catalyzing multiplication while preserving quality, navigating the tension between organization and institutionalization, responding to system-wide problems that resist simple solutions. These aren't technical problems that can be solved by applying known expertise. They're adaptive challenges that require new learning, experimentation, and system-level thinking.

This is where Donella Meadows comes in.

Donella Meadows was a systems thinker, environmental scientist, and lead author of the groundbreaking book *Limits to Growth*. But more importantly for our purposes, she was a master at explaining how systems work—how they behave, why they resist change, where the leverage points are for effective intervention. Her work provides a language and framework for understanding complex systems that is both profound and practical.

Now, let me be clear: I'm not suggesting we replace theological understanding with systems theory. Systems thinking is not a substitute for theological wisdom. But it is a tool—a powerful tool—for understanding how movement systems actually work, for diagnosing problems, for identifying leverage points, for designing interventions that align with how systems actually behave.

Think of it this way: if movement flows from Christology (as we established above), then understanding how movement systems work is part of stewarding that theological reality. Systems thinking helps us see the "how" behind the "what"—the dynamics behind the structures, the processes behind the patterns.

## The Language of Systems

If we're going to think systemically about movements, we need to learn the language. And like any language, systems thinking has its own vocabulary—words and concepts that help us see what was previously invisible.

### Stocks and Flows

The most basic elements of any system are **stocks** and **flows**. 

A stock is an accumulation of something—the water in a bathtub, the money in a bank account, the number of disciples in your movement. Stocks are what you can count, measure, observe at any given moment.

A flow is the rate at which stocks change—water flowing into or out of the bathtub, money being deposited or withdrawn, disciples being made or lost. Flows are what cause stocks to increase or decrease over time.

Why does this matter for movement leaders? Because we often confuse stocks and flows, or focus on one while ignoring the other. We might focus on the stock (how many disciples we have) while ignoring the flow (how many are being made, and at what rate). Or we might focus on a particular flow (the rate of multiplication) while ignoring the stock (the quality and coherence of what's being multiplied).

But here's what's crucial: stocks and flows are always connected. You can't understand a stock without understanding the flows that feed it. You can't manage a flow without understanding the stock it's affecting. And both are shaped by feedback loops—which brings us to our next concept.

### Feedback Loops

This is where systems thinking gets really interesting—and really important for movement leaders.

A feedback loop is a circular chain of cause-and-effect relationships. It's what happens when the output of a system feeds back into the system as input, creating a loop. Feedback loops are what make systems dynamic, what enable them to self-regulate, what cause them to behave in ways that seem to have a mind of their own.

There are two basic types of feedback loops:

**Reinforcing loops** (also called positive feedback loops) amplify whatever is happening. They create exponential growth or exponential decline. A small change gets amplified through the loop, creating bigger and bigger effects. Think of a snowball rolling down a hill, or compound interest, or a movement that's multiplying.

Reinforcing loops are powerful. They're what enable exponential growth in movements. But they're also what can cause movements to spiral out of control or collapse rapidly if they turn negative.

**Balancing loops** (also called negative feedback loops) counteract whatever is happening. They create stability, equilibrium, self-regulation. Think of a thermostat maintaining a constant temperature, or your body maintaining a constant temperature, or a movement maintaining DNA coherence while scaling.

Balancing loops are essential. They're what prevent systems from spinning out of control. But they're also what can prevent systems from changing, what can lock them into patterns that resist transformation.

Here's what's crucial for movement leaders to understand: movements need both types of loops. They need reinforcing loops to multiply and grow. They need balancing loops to maintain coherence and prevent drift. The challenge is finding the right balance between the two—enough reinforcement to enable multiplication, enough balance to maintain DNA.

But there's more: feedback loops operate at different time scales. Some loops create immediate effects. Others have delays—sometimes significant delays—between cause and effect. These delays are what make systems behavior so counterintuitive. We make a change, don't see immediate results, assume it didn't work, and try something else—only to have the effects of our first intervention show up later, creating unintended consequences.

This is why movement leaders need systems thinking. Without it, we're like doctors treating symptoms without understanding the underlying system. We intervene in ways that create short-term relief but long-term problems. We optimize parts of the system in ways that sub-optimize the whole.

### Leverage Points

This brings us to one of Donella Meadows' most important contributions: the concept of leverage points.

A leverage point is a place in a system where a small change can produce large effects. It's where you can intervene with maximum impact and minimum effort. But here's the thing: not all leverage points are created equal. Some have more leverage than others. And counterintuitively, the most obvious leverage points often have the least leverage.

Meadows identified twelve leverage points, ranked from least to most effective. At the lower end are things like parameters (changing numbers, adjusting constants), buffers (changing the size of stocks), and stock-and-flow structures (changing the physical structure of the system). These are where we typically focus our attention—and where we typically get the least results.

At the higher end are things like information flows (changing what information is available to whom), rules (changing the rules of the system), self-organization (changing the system's ability to structure itself), and paradigms (changing the mind-set or model out of which the system arises). These are where real transformation happens—and where we typically avoid because they're harder, riskier, less certain.

For movement leaders, this is game-changing. It means that the most effective interventions are often not the most obvious ones. Changing a program (low leverage) might produce less impact than changing how information flows through the system (higher leverage). Adding resources (low leverage) might produce less impact than changing the rules that govern behavior (higher leverage). Restructuring the organization (medium leverage) might produce less impact than shifting the paradigm (highest leverage).

This is why movements that focus on metanoia—on paradigm shift—often experience transformation that programmatic changes can never achieve. They're intervening at the highest leverage point: the level of paradigm, the way we think about the system itself.

## Movement Systems vs. Institutional Systems

Before we go further, we need to make an important distinction: **movement systems are fundamentally different from institutional systems**.

This isn't just semantics. It's a fundamental difference in how systems are structured, how they behave, how they respond to intervention.

Institutional systems are designed for control. They use hierarchical structures, centralized authority, standardized processes, formal rules. They optimize for efficiency, predictability, stability. They function like machines—predictable, controllable, maintainable.

Movement systems are designed for multiplication. They use network structures, distributed authority, simple rules, reproducible practices. They optimize for adaptability, reproducibility, multiplication. They function like organisms—self-organizing, adaptive, reproductive.

Think of the difference between a spider and a starfish (a metaphor I've used before, and one that's worth revisiting here). A spider has a head and legs. Cut off the head, and the spider dies. It's centralized, hierarchical, controlled. An institution works like a spider.

A starfish has a distributed nervous system. Cut it in half, and you get two starfish. It's decentralized, networked, self-organizing. A movement works like a starfish.

This difference matters for systems thinking because **movement systems and institutional systems respond differently to the same interventions**. What works in an institutional system might actually harm a movement system. What fails in an institutional system might be exactly what a movement system needs.

For example, in an institutional system, adding more structure often improves control and efficiency. In a movement system, adding more structure often reduces adaptability and multiplication. In an institutional system, centralizing authority can improve coordination. In a movement system, centralizing authority can kill movemental energy. In an institutional system, standardizing processes can improve quality. In a movement system, standardizing processes can prevent contextual adaptation.

This is why movement leaders need systems thinking that's specific to movements—not just generic organizational systems thinking, but thinking that understands how movement systems actually work.

## Systems Archetypes in Movements

As we learn to see systems, we begin to recognize patterns—recurring structures and behaviors that appear across different contexts. These are called systems archetypes, and understanding them is crucial for movement leaders.

Systems archetypes are like templates—common patterns of system behavior that help us diagnose problems and identify intervention strategies. They're the "stories" that systems tell, the predictable ways they behave.

Let me introduce a few that are particularly relevant for movements:

### The Limits to Growth Archetype

This archetype describes what happens when a reinforcing loop creates growth, but that growth eventually encounters a balancing loop that limits it. The system grows until it hits a limit, at which point growth slows or stops.

In movements, this happens all the time. Multiplication creates growth (reinforcing loop), but that growth eventually encounters limits: leadership capacity, DNA coherence, resource constraints, contextual barriers. The movement hits a ceiling.

The key insight here is that you can't solve a limits-to-growth problem by pushing harder on the growth loop. You have to address the limiting factor—the balancing loop that's creating the ceiling. Otherwise, you're just pushing against a wall.

### The Shifting the Burden Archetype

This archetype describes what happens when we address a problem symptomatically (a "quick fix") rather than addressing the underlying cause. The symptom goes away temporarily, but the problem persists and often gets worse.

In movements, we do this constantly. We see a problem (declining multiplication, DNA drift, loss of movemental energy), apply a quick fix (new program, new structure, new initiative), see temporary improvement, but the underlying problem remains. Over time, we become dependent on the quick fix, and the real problem gets worse.

The key insight here is that quick fixes are addictive. They create dependency. They prevent us from addressing root causes. And in systems, addressing symptoms without addressing causes always leads to worse problems down the road.

### The Success to the Successful Archetype

This archetype describes what happens when success creates more success, but in a way that creates winners and losers. Those who succeed get more resources, more attention, more opportunity—which leads to more success. Those who don't succeed get less resources, less attention, less opportunity—which leads to less success. The gap widens.

In movements, this can happen when some expressions or leaders get all the attention and resources, while others are overlooked. The successful ones become more successful, the overlooked ones struggle, and the movement becomes less diverse, less distributed, less movemental.

The key insight here is that reinforcing loops can create inequality and exclusion. Movements need balancing mechanisms to ensure that success doesn't concentrate in ways that undermine the movement itself.

## Why This Matters

Let me bring this back to where we started: **movement-ology is theological work, not just organizational work**. But it's theological work that requires understanding how systems actually work.

If movement flows from Christology—if it's the apostolic form of the church—then understanding movement systems is part of stewarding what God is doing in the world. Systems thinking isn't a replacement for theological wisdom, but it is a tool for understanding how the theological reality of movement actually functions in practice.

This is why advanced movement leaders need systems literacy. Not so we can control movements (movements resist control by their very nature), but so we can steward them well. Not so we can manipulate systems (that always backfires), but so we can align with how they actually work.

In the weeks that follow, we're going to explore how to apply systems thinking to movements—how to understand mDNA as a living system, how to identify leverage points, how to work with feedback loops, how to diagnose system problems, how to design interventions that align with system dynamics.

But for now, the key point is this: movements are systems. They behave like systems. They respond to intervention like systems. And if we want to lead movements well, we need to think systemically.

This doesn't mean we become systems engineers or organizational consultants. It means we become systems-aware movement leaders—leaders who understand how movement systems actually work, who can diagnose problems at the system level, who can identify leverage points, who can design interventions that align with system dynamics rather than working against them.

This is movement-ology. This is what advanced movement leadership requires. And this is what we're going to explore in the weeks ahead.

## Who This Is For

Maybe you're new to systems thinking. Maybe you've been leading movements for years but have never thought about them systemically. Maybe you're wrestling with the gap between what your movement is and what it could be, and you're looking for new ways to understand and intervene.

Or maybe you're coming back to these ideas for what I call **metanoia**—that deep rethinking, that remembering, that recognition that you've been thinking about things the wrong way. Maybe you've been operating in institutional modes, and you're realizing something's missing. Maybe you've been trying to engineer movement through programs and strategies, and you're discovering it doesn't work that way.

This course is for both of you. For the beginner and for the one in metanoia. For the one who's discovering and for the one who's remembering.

Because here's the thing: whether you're learning this for the first time or coming back to it for the hundredth time, the invitation is the same. Learn to see movements as systems. Understand how systems actually work. Align your leadership with system dynamics rather than working against them.

## What to Expect

In the weeks ahead, we're going to explore movement systems at depth. We're going to draw on Donella Meadows' systems thinking framework—not as a replacement for theological understanding, but as a tool for understanding how movement systems work. We're going to examine leverage points, feedback loops, system dynamics, and intervention strategies—all within a theological framework that recognizes movement as flowing from Christology.

We're going to look at how mDNA functions as a living system, how APEST operates as distributed intelligence, how the Metanoia Journey works as system transformation. We're going to explore the challenges of scaling, the dynamics of networks, the processes of system renewal.

But throughout it all, we're going to keep returning to this foundational truth: **Christology begets movement**. Movement is not something we create. It's something we steward. It's something that flows from who Jesus is and what he came to do.

And movement-ology—the understanding and practice of movement systems—is fundamentally about participating in that flow, aligning with that dynamic, stewarding that reality.

## The Journey Ahead

This is not going to be easy. I should tell you that upfront.

Learning to think systemically isn't easy. It requires metanoia—deep rethinking, paradigm shifts, wholehearted transformation. It requires letting go of linear thinking, control-oriented approaches, programmatic solutions. It requires courage, risk, adventure.

But I'll also tell you this: the future lies in the womb of the present. The potential for movement already exists. We don't need to create something new. We need to understand how systems actually work. We need to align with system dynamics rather than working against them.

And maybe, just maybe, this moment—this moment of cultural shift, this moment when we're being forced to ask what's really essential—is exactly the right moment to do that.

So here's my invitation to you: Come with me on this journey. Whether you're new to systems thinking or coming back for metanoia, whether you're discovering or remembering, whether you're a beginner or someone who's been wrestling with these questions for years.

Come and learn to see movements as systems. Come and understand how systems actually work. Come and align your leadership with system dynamics.

Come and participate in what God is already doing.

The journey begins here. The journey begins now.

And it all starts—and ends—with this: **For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible... all things have been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.**

Everything flows from him. Everything comes through him. Everything is for him.

Even movement systems. Especially movement systems.
