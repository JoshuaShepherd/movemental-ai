# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **What brought you to this moment?** What questions are you carrying about movement systems? What challenges are you facing that led you to this course?

2. **Where are you in your journey?** Are you discovering systems thinking for the first time, or are you coming back to it for metanoia—that deep rethinking about how movements actually work? What does that mean for how you approach this material?

3. **How do you currently think about your movement?** Do you see it as a system, or do you think about it in other ways (as an organization, a program, a network)? How would thinking systemically change your perspective?

4. **What system challenges are you facing?** Where do you see unintended consequences from your interventions? Where do you make changes in one area and see unexpected results in another?

5. **Where do you see movement systems already functioning well in your context?** What's working? What gives you hope? Where do you see the characteristics of movement systems (multiplication, DNA transmission, distributed leadership)?

6. **Where do you see institutional systems that might be preventing movement?** What structures, processes, or ways of thinking are working against movemental energy? What needs to shift?

7. **How does Colossians 1:15-20—"in him all things were created... in him all things hold together"—speak to you right now?** What does it mean that movement systems are created through Christ and hold together in Christ? How does that connect to your leadership?

8. **What's your next step?** What do you need to do to engage this journey fully? What support do you need? What questions do you want to explore further?
