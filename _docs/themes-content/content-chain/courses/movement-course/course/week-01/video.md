**Video Focus:** Introduction to Systems Thinking for Movement Leaders

**Content Description:**
This video would introduce the core concepts of systems thinking as they apply to movements. It would explain why movements are systems, not machines, and why that matters for leadership. It would introduce basic systems concepts (stocks and flows, feedback loops, leverage points) in accessible ways, using movement examples. It would connect systems thinking to the theological foundation—how understanding systems is part of stewarding what God is doing in the world.

**Key Points:**
- Movements are systems, not machines
- Systems think differently than we do
- Systems thinking is a tool for stewarding movement systems
- Movement systems vs. institutional systems
- Basic systems concepts: stocks, flows, feedback loops, leverage points

**Connection to Week's Themes:**
This video would ground the week's reading in visual and narrative form, making systems concepts more accessible and memorable. It would help participants see their movements through a systems lens and understand why systems thinking matters for movement leadership.
