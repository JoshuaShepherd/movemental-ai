# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you are in your journey and what questions you're bringing.*

**Focus:** Helps participants assess their movement's DNA health—which elements are present and functioning? Which are missing or suppressed? How are the elements interacting? Is Apostolic Genius emerging?

**Sample Prompts:**
- How would you assess your movement's DNA health? Which of the six elements are present and functioning? Which might be missing or suppressed?
- Are the elements of mDNA interacting systemically in your movement, or are they operating as silos? What evidence do you see?
- Is Apostolic Genius emerging in your movement? Can you feel that movemental energy, or does it feel more mechanical?
- Where do you see healthy DNA adaptation in your context? Where do you see DNA drift?
- What would it mean for you to think about mDNA as a living system rather than a checklist? How would that change your approach?
- If you were to diagnose your movement's system health, what would you discover? What are the vital signs telling you?

**Conversation Objectives:**
- Participants assess their movement's DNA health using systems thinking
- Participants identify which elements are present, missing, or suppressed
- Participants recognize whether elements are interacting systemically or operating as silos
- Participants identify whether Apostolic Genius is emerging
- Participants discover one concrete area where system health needs attention
