# Anchor Scripture: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27

> "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many. Now if the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,' it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. And if the ear should say, 'Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,' it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. If they were all one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body. The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I don't need you!' And the head cannot say to the feet, 'I don't need you!' On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it."  
> —1 Corinthians 12:12-27

## Reading Practice: Meditative Reading

Before we dive into this week's content, I want to invite you to spend time with this passage from 1 Corinthians. It's one of the most powerful descriptions of the church as a system—not just a collection of individuals, but a living body where each part functions in relationship with the whole.

Take a moment. Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body...*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the phrase "the body is not made up of one part but of many." What does it mean that movement DNA requires all six elements, not just one or two? What happens when parts are missing?

Read it a third time, focusing on "God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be." What does it mean that each element of mDNA has a specific function in the system? How do they work together?

Read it one more time, focusing on "if one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it." What does it mean that the elements of mDNA create feedback loops with each other? How does the health of one element affect the health of the whole system?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just the six elements of mDNA, but how they function as a living system—how they interact, how they create feedback loops, how they enable Apostolic Genius to emerge. We're exploring what it means that movement DNA is systemic—not just a checklist, but a living system where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Because here's what I want you to see: if the church is a body—a living system—then movement DNA functions the same way. It's not just six separate elements. It's a system where each element needs the others, where they work together, where something greater emerges when they're all present and functioning.

Everything connects. Everything interacts. Everything works together.

Even movement DNA. Especially movement DNA.
