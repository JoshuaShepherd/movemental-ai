# Looking Ahead

In the next week, we're going to explore **Leverage Points and Feedback Loops**. This is where systems thinking gets really practical for movement leaders.

We're going to learn about the twelve leverage points—places in the system where small changes can produce large effects. We're going to discover why the most obvious interventions often have the least leverage, and why the highest leverage interventions are often the ones we avoid. We're going to explore how reinforcing loops create multiplication and how balancing loops maintain coherence. We're going to learn how to work with system delays—those frustrating time gaps between cause and effect.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: understanding mDNA as a living system is the foundation. Now we're going to learn how to intervene effectively in that system—where to focus your energy, where to invest your resources, where to make changes that actually matter.

The system is there. The elements are present (or need to be). The interactions are happening (or need to happen).

Now we need to learn where to intervene. We need to understand leverage. We need to work with feedback loops.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from him, through him, and for him.

Everything. Always. Forever.
