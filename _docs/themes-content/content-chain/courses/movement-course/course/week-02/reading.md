# Week 2: Movement DNA as a Living System

If you've been working with movement DNA (mDNA) for any length of time, you know it's not a checklist. You know it's not six separate elements that you can add one at a time until you get movement. You know that having five out of six elements doesn't give you 83% of a movement—it gives you zero movement, because the system doesn't activate.

But here's what you might not have fully grasped: **mDNA is a living system**. It's not just systemic in the sense that the elements work together. It's systemic in the sense that it functions like a complex, adaptive, living system—with feedback loops, emergent properties, system dynamics, and behaviors that follow system rules rather than linear logic.

This changes everything about how we understand and work with mDNA. If mDNA is a living system, then we need to think about it systemically—not as components to assemble, but as a dynamic system to understand, diagnose, and activate.

## Why "Living System"?

Let me be clear about what I mean by "living system." I'm not just using organic metaphors here (though the organic nature of movements is important). I'm talking about systems that exhibit the characteristics of living organisms: they're self-organizing, adaptive, self-regulating, capable of reproduction, and they exhibit emergent properties that don't exist in their component parts.

A machine is different. You can take a machine apart, understand each component, put it back together, and it works the same way. But you can't do that with a living system. A living system is more than the sum of its parts. The whole has properties and behaviors that don't exist in any of the parts individually.

Think of a forest ecosystem. You can study each component individually—the trees, the soil, the fungi, the insects, the birds. You can understand each part in detail. But if you've ever walked through an old-growth forest, you know there's something more going on—something that can't be found in any single component. The forest has properties that emerge from the interactions: the way it regulates its own climate, the way nutrients cycle through the system, the way it adapts to disturbances, the way it reproduces and maintains itself. The forest is a living system.

This is exactly what we see with mDNA. Each of the six elements is important—you can study them individually, understand them separately. But Apostolic Genius—that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy—doesn't exist in any of the elements individually. It emerges when the system comes alive, when all the elements are present and interacting. It's an emergent property of the system functioning as a whole.

Think of it this way: you can have "Jesus is Lord" as a confession, but without the other elements, you don't get movement. You can have disciple-making happening, but without APEST culture and organic systems, you don't get movement. You can have all the elements present, but if they're not functioning together systemically—if they're operating as silos rather than as an integrated system—you still don't get movement.

I've seen this over and over again in movements I've worked with. A movement might have strong disciple-making happening—people are being formed, Jesus is being followed. But if the system structure is institutional rather than organic, multiplication doesn't happen. Or a movement might have excellent missional engagement, but if APEST culture isn't functioning—if the system intelligence is truncated to just Shepherd-Teacher—the movement can't adapt or see system-wide challenges. The elements are there, but the system isn't functioning as a living whole.

Apostolic Genius only emerges when the system is functioning as a living system. It's not something you can build or create by assembling parts. It's something that emerges when the system conditions are right—when all six elements are present and interacting systemically, when feedback loops are functioning, when the system is able to self-organize and adapt. It's like the difference between a collection of musical instruments and an orchestra playing together. The instruments are necessary, but the music—that's what emerges when they're functioning together as a system.

## The Six Elements as System Components

So let's look at the six elements of mDNA through a systems lens. What does it mean to see each element as a system component—not just an ingredient to add, but a functional part of a dynamic system?

### Jesus is Lord: The System's Foundation and Goal

"Jesus is Lord" is not just the first element in the list. It's the foundation that gives the system its identity and purpose. In system terms, it functions as both the system's **goal** (what the system exists to express) and its **paradigm** (the fundamental assumptions that shape how the system operates).

Systems have goals—sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit. The goal shapes everything else. In movement systems, "Jesus is Lord" functions as the goal: the system exists to express the lordship of Christ, to extend his rule and reign, to multiply his presence.

But it also functions as the paradigm—the fundamental way of seeing reality. If "Jesus is Lord" is the paradigm, then the system operates on the assumption that Christ is central, that his mission is primary, that his way is the way. This paradigm shapes every other element, influences every system dynamic, determines what the system optimizes for.

In system terms, changing the goal or paradigm of a system is the highest leverage intervention possible (we'll explore this more in Week 3). This is why "Jesus is Lord" is not just one element among six—it's the element that shapes all the others.

### Disciple-Making: The System's Reproduction Mechanism

Disciple-making functions as the system's **reproduction mechanism**. In systems thinking, living systems reproduce themselves. They pass on their DNA to the next generation. Disciple-making is how movement systems do this.

But here's what's crucial from a systems perspective: reproduction isn't just copying. It's passing on the DNA—the essential characteristics—while allowing for adaptation and contextualization. Disciple-making ensures that the system's DNA gets transmitted, that new expressions carry the essential elements, that the movement reproduces faithfully.

Disciple-making also creates a **reinforcing feedback loop**. Disciples make disciples, who make disciples, who make disciples. This is exponential multiplication—the kind of growth that movements are capable of. But it only works if the DNA is being passed on faithfully.

### Missional-Incarnational Impulse: The System's Engagement Mechanism

The missional-incarnational impulse functions as the system's **engagement mechanism**—how the system interacts with its environment. In systems thinking, living systems are open systems. They exchange energy, information, and resources with their environment. The missional-incarnational impulse is how movement systems do this.

The missional part (going out) creates **flows**—energy, people, resources flowing outward. The incarnational part (going deep) creates **stocks**—presence, relationships, embeddedness accumulating in contexts. Both are necessary for the system to function.

Without the missional impulse, the system becomes insular, closed, unable to engage with its environment. Without the incarnational impulse, the system remains superficial, unable to deeply impact contexts. Both together create the dynamic engagement that movements require.

### APEST Culture: The System's Intelligence Architecture

APEST culture functions as the system's **distributed intelligence architecture**. In systems thinking, complex systems need distributed intelligence—not centralized control, but intelligence spread throughout the system. APEST culture provides this.

Each of the five functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) represents a different kind of intelligence, a different way of reading the system, a different capacity for intervention. When all five are present and functioning, the system can see more, respond better, adapt faster.

But here's the systems insight: if any of the five functions are missing, the system has **blind spots**. It can't see certain problems, can't respond to certain challenges, can't adapt in certain ways. This is why the Western church's truncation to ST (Shepherd-Teacher) creates system problems—the system loses critical intelligence.

APEST culture also creates **balancing and reinforcing loops** between the functions. APE functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) tend to create change, movement, multiplication. ST functions (Shepherd, Teacher) tend to create stability, coherence, depth. The system needs both in dynamic tension.

### Organic Systems: The System's Structure

Organic systems function as the system's **structural architecture**—how the system is organized. But here's the crucial systems insight: in living systems, structure and function are inseparable. The way the system is structured determines how it functions.

Organic systems are organized like living organisms—self-organizing, adaptive, fractal, networked. This structure enables reproduction, multiplication, scaling. Institutional systems are organized like machines—hierarchical, controlled, standardized. This structure enables efficiency, predictability, control.

You can't have movement with institutional structures. The structure determines the function. This is why organic systems are not optional—they're essential. The system structure must match the system purpose.

### Communitas: The System's Cohesion Mechanism

Communitas functions as the system's **cohesion mechanism**—what holds the system together. But not just any kind of cohesion. Communitas is cohesion through shared purpose, shared risk, shared adventure—not cohesion through safety, comfort, or similarity.

In systems thinking, living systems need cohesion to function as a whole, but the kind of cohesion matters. If cohesion comes from safety and comfort, the system becomes risk-averse, unable to engage liminal spaces, unable to multiply. If cohesion comes from communitas—shared purpose and adventure—the system remains dynamic, willing to take risks, capable of multiplication.

Communitas also creates the **liminal conditions** that enable system transformation. Systems often need disruption, risk, challenge to grow and adapt. Communitas provides this in a constructive way—not random chaos, but purposeful adventure.

## How the Elements Interact Systemically

Now here's what's crucial: these elements don't just exist alongside each other. They interact systemically. They create feedback loops with each other. They influence and shape each other. The system only functions when they're interacting.

Let me give you some examples of how the elements create feedback loops with each other:

**"Jesus is Lord" ↔ Disciple-Making**: The confession shapes what discipleship looks like (Jesus-shaped discipleship), and disciple-making reinforces the confession (disciples learn to live under Christ's lordship). This creates a reinforcing loop.

**Disciple-Making ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Disciples engage missionally-incarnationally, which creates more disciples, who engage missionally-incarnationally. This creates a reinforcing loop that enables multiplication.

**APEST Culture ↔ Organic Systems**: APEST culture shapes how systems are structured (distributed intelligence requires distributed structures), and organic systems enable APEST culture to function (fractal, networked structures support fivefold functions). This creates a reinforcing loop.

**Communitas ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Communitas forms through shared mission and risk, which enables deeper missional-incarnational engagement, which creates more communitas. This creates a reinforcing loop.

But there are also balancing loops. For example:

**APEST Culture**: The APE functions (change agents) and ST functions (stability agents) create a balancing loop. Too much change without stability creates chaos. Too much stability without change creates stasis. The system needs both in tension.

**Organic Systems ↔ Institution**: As movements grow, there's a natural tendency toward institutionalization (a balancing loop that creates stability). But this can kill movemental energy. The system needs to resist this balancing loop or channel it in healthy ways.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Depth**: Going out can undermine going deep, and going deep can limit going out. This creates a balancing loop that the system must navigate.

The point is this: the elements don't just coexist. They interact. They create system dynamics. They produce feedback loops. And the system only functions when these interactions are happening.

## Emergent Properties: When Systems Come Alive

Here's where it gets really interesting from a systems perspective: when all six elements are present and interacting systemically, something emerges that doesn't exist in any of the elements individually.

This is **Apostolic Genius**—that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that we can't quite define but know when we see it. It's not something you can create or engineer. It's an emergent property of the system functioning as a whole.

In systems thinking, emergent properties are properties of a system that don't exist in the system's components. They emerge from the interactions between components. Think of consciousness emerging from the interactions of neurons, or life emerging from the interactions of molecules, or a melody emerging from the interactions of individual notes. None of these properties exist in the individual components. They arise from the system functioning as an integrated whole.

Apostolic Genius is like this. You can't find it in any of the six elements individually. You can't create it by adding the elements together like ingredients in a recipe. It emerges when the system is functioning as an integrated living system—when all the elements are present, when they're interacting systemically, when feedback loops are creating dynamic relationships between them.

I've seen this emerge in movements, and when it happens, you know it immediately. Suddenly, multiplication starts happening without centralized control. DNA gets transmitted faithfully even across distances and contexts. The movement begins to self-organize in ways that surprise even the leaders. New expressions form that carry the DNA forward. There's an energy, a momentum, a life to the movement that wasn't there before—not because someone planned it, but because the system came alive.

But here's the crucial thing: this emergent property is fragile. You can have all six elements present and still not have movement. The elements might be there, but they're not interacting systemically. They're operating as silos—discipleship over here, mission over there, APEST functions happening in isolation. And without systemic interaction, the emergent property doesn't emerge. It's like having all the musicians in the room, but they're each playing their own song. The music doesn't emerge.

This is also why you can't engineer movement. You can't program Apostolic Genius into existence through better strategy or more sophisticated planning. You can create the conditions for it—you can ensure all six elements are present and functioning, you can facilitate systemic interaction, you can remove barriers to feedback loops, you can align structures with system purpose. But you can't manufacture the emergent property itself. It's not a product of management; it's a property of life.

This is both frustrating and liberating. It's frustrating because it means movement isn't something we can control or guarantee through our own efforts. But it's liberating because it means movement isn't something we have to create—it's something that emerges when we align with how systems actually work. We're not manufacturers; we're gardeners. We create the conditions, we tend the soil, we remove obstacles—but the life itself emerges from the system.

Think about how the early church movement emerged. The elements were there—the confession "Jesus is Lord," disciple-making happening, missional engagement, fivefold functions operating, organic structures, communitas forged in persecution. But what emerged was something no one could have engineered: a movement that multiplied across the Roman Empire in just two centuries, transforming cultures and challenging empires. That was Apostolic Genius emerging—not because someone planned it that way, but because the system came alive.

## System Health Diagnostics: Reading the Vital Signs

If mDNA is a living system, then we need ways to diagnose system health—to know whether the system is functioning as it should, whether it's healthy or sick, whether it's moving toward life or toward death. Just as a doctor reads vital signs to assess a patient's health—heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiration—movement leaders need to read system signals to assess movement health.

But here's the challenge: living systems don't always give clear signals. They have delays between cause and effect. They have feedback loops that can mask problems. They have emergent properties that make behavior hard to predict. A system might look healthy on the surface while underlying problems are developing. Or a system might show symptoms of distress that actually indicate it's fighting off something unhealthy.

This is why system health diagnostics require more than just checking off a list. You can't just ask "Do we have all six elements?" and check the box. You have to ask deeper questions: Are the elements functioning systemically? Are they interacting? Are feedback loops creating the right dynamics? Is the system self-organizing? Is Apostolic Genius emerging?

So how do we diagnose system health? What are the vital signs of a healthy movement system? Here are some key indicators that tell you whether the system is functioning as a living system:

### Vital Signs of System Health

**1. All Six Elements Present and Functioning**

This is the most basic diagnostic: are all six elements of mDNA present? Not just present as concepts or programs, but functioning systemically? You can have "Jesus is Lord" as a statement without it functioning as the system's goal and paradigm. You can have disciple-making happening without it functioning as the system's reproduction mechanism. You need to check not just presence but function.

**2. Systemic Interaction**

Are the elements interacting systemically, or are they operating as silos? This is harder to assess but crucial. You might have good discipleship and good mission, but if they're not creating reinforcing loops with each other, the system isn't functioning.

**3. Emergent Properties Visible**

Is Apostolic Genius visible? This is perhaps the most telling diagnostic. When a movement system is healthy, you can feel it. There's an energy, a momentum, a life to it that wasn't engineered but emerged. Do you see multiplication happening naturally, without centralized control? Do you see DNA being passed on faithfully across contexts and distances? Do you see the system self-organizing—new expressions forming, leaders emerging, adaptive responses happening? Do you see that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that makes you think "This is what movement feels like"?

If Apostolic Genius isn't emerging—if multiplication has stalled, if DNA is drifting, if the system feels mechanical rather than alive—then the system isn't healthy, even if all six elements appear to be present. The emergent property is the proof that the system is functioning as a living system. Without it, you have components, but you don't have a living system.

**4. Feedback Loops Functioning**

Are reinforcing loops creating multiplication? Are balancing loops maintaining coherence? Are delays being accounted for? Healthy systems have functioning feedback loops.

**5. System Adapting and Learning**

Living systems adapt and learn. Is your movement system adapting to new contexts? Is it learning from experience? Is it evolving while maintaining DNA? Healthy systems are adaptive.

### Early Warning Signals

Systems also give early warning signals when they're in trouble:

**1. Elements Missing or Suppressed**

If any of the six elements are missing or suppressed, the system can't function. This is an immediate red flag.

**2. Silo Behavior**

If elements are operating independently rather than systemically, the system isn't functioning. This often shows up as programs that don't connect, activities that don't reinforce each other, initiatives that compete rather than complement.

**3. Loss of Emergent Properties**

If Apostolic Genius disappears—if multiplication stops, if DNA drift happens, if movemental energy wanes, if the system starts feeling mechanical rather than alive—the system is in trouble. This is often a delayed signal, which makes it particularly dangerous. The problem happened earlier (elements stopped interacting, feedback loops broke down, structure shifted from organic to institutional), but the effects are showing now. By the time the emergent property disappears, the system has already been sick for a while. This is why monitoring system health regularly is so important—you want to catch problems before the emergent property disappears, because once it's gone, reactivation becomes much harder.

**4. Feedback Loops Breaking Down**

If reinforcing loops aren't creating multiplication, or if balancing loops aren't maintaining coherence, the system is breaking down. This can show up as exponential decline or as loss of coherence.

**5. System Rigidity**

If the system becomes rigid, unable to adapt, stuck in patterns, it's moving toward equilibrium—which kills movemental energy. This is often a late-stage signal.

## mDNA Suppression and Reactivation

One of the most hopeful insights about mDNA as a living system is that it can be suppressed but it can also be reactivated. The DNA is always there—it's built into the system. But it can be suppressed, dormant, not functioning.

How does suppression happen? From a systems perspective, suppression happens when:

**1. Elements Are Missing or Suppressed**

If any of the six elements are missing or suppressed, the system can't function. This is the most obvious form of suppression.

**2. Elements Are Operating as Silos**

If the elements are present but not interacting systemically, the system doesn't activate. The elements are there, but they're not functioning as a system.

**3. System Structure Prevents Function**

If the system is structured in ways that prevent systemic interaction (institutional structures, hierarchical control, programmatic approaches), the system can't function even if all elements are present.

**4. System Goals Are Misaligned**

If the system's goals are misaligned with movement (optimizing for attendance, programs, control rather than multiplication, mission, movement), the system functions in ways that suppress movemental DNA.

**5. Feedback Loops Are Broken**

If feedback loops are broken—if reinforcing loops don't create multiplication, if balancing loops don't maintain coherence—the system can't sustain itself.

The good news is that reactivation is possible. The DNA is still there. The system can be reactivated. But reactivation requires:

**1. Restoring All Six Elements**

All six elements must be present and functioning. You can't reactivate with five out of six.

**2. Creating Systemic Interaction**

The elements must be interacting systemically, not operating as silos. This often requires structural changes.

**3. Aligning System Goals**

The system's goals must be aligned with movement. This often requires paradigm shift (metanoia).

**4. Restoring Feedback Loops**

Feedback loops must be functioning. This often requires removing barriers and creating enabling conditions.

**5. Changing System Structure**

If the structure is preventing function, the structure must change. This is why reactivation often requires transformation, not just improvement.

Reactivating mDNA is not about adding programs or tweaking activities. It's about system reactivation—bringing the system back to life. This is hard work. It requires system-level intervention. It might require structural changes, paradigm shifts, breaking down silos, restoring feedback loops. But it's possible because the DNA is always there, encoded in the very nature of the church, waiting to be activated.

Think of it like reviving a dormant seed. The genetic information is there, but it needs the right conditions—water, soil, temperature, light—to come alive. The seed doesn't need new information added to it; it needs the conditions that allow what's already there to activate. Similarly, mDNA doesn't need to be created; it needs the conditions that allow it to function as a living system.

## What This Means for Movement Leaders

If mDNA is a living system, then working with mDNA requires systems thinking. You can't treat it like a checklist or a formula. You have to understand it as a system.

This means:

**1. Think Systemically, Not Linearly**

Don't think "we need to add this element, then this element, then this element." Think "we need all six elements present and interacting systemically."

**2. Focus on Interaction, Not Just Presence**

It's not enough for elements to be present. They must be interacting systemically. Focus on creating conditions for systemic interaction.

**3. Look for Emergent Properties**

If Apostolic Genius isn't emerging, the system isn't functioning. Don't try to create it directly. Create the conditions for it to emerge.

**4. Monitor System Health**

Regularly diagnose system health. Read system signals. Pay attention to feedback loops. Look for early warning indicators.

**5. Intervene Systemically**

When problems arise, don't just fix symptoms. Address system dynamics. Work with feedback loops. Consider leverage points.

This is what it means to work with mDNA as a living system. It's not easy. It requires systems thinking, systems awareness, systems skills. But it's the only way to truly understand and steward movement DNA.

## DNA Health Check: A Practical Framework

If you've been working with mDNA, you might be wondering: how do I know if the DNA is healthy? How do I assess whether all six elements are present and functioning systemically? How do I detect DNA drift before it becomes a problem?

Let me give you a practical framework for assessing DNA health. This isn't a complex diagnostic—it's a simple way to check whether your movement's DNA is functioning as a living system. Use these questions to assess DNA health regularly.

### Element Presence Check

**Question**: Are all six elements present and functioning?

For each element, ask: Is it present? Is it functioning systemically? Is it interacting with other elements? If any element is missing or not functioning, the system can't activate. All six must be present and functioning.

### Systemic Interaction Check

**Question**: Are the elements interacting systemically, or operating as silos?

Look at how elements interact. Do they create feedback loops? Do they reinforce each other? Do they work together systemically? If elements are operating in silos, the system isn't functioning. The elements must interact.

### Emergent Property Check

**Question**: Is Apostolic Genius emerging?

Look for Apostolic Genius. Is it emerging? Can you feel it? Is multiplication happening naturally? Is DNA being transmitted faithfully? Is the system self-organizing? If Apostolic Genius isn't emerging, the system isn't functioning as a living system, even if all six elements appear to be present.

### DNA Drift Check

**Question**: Is DNA drifting, or adapting healthily?

Look at how DNA adapts. Is it maintaining core identity while enabling contextual expression? Or is it losing core identity while trying to adapt? Healthy adaptation maintains DNA. DNA drift loses it.

### System Health Indicators

**Healthy System**: All six elements present and functioning. Elements interacting systemically. Apostolic Genius emerging. DNA adapting healthily. System self-organizing. Multiplication happening. DNA transmitting faithfully.

**Unhealthy System**: Elements missing or suppressed. Elements operating in silos. Apostolic Genius not emerging. DNA drifting. System not self-organizing. Multiplication stalled. DNA not transmitting.

This framework isn't about perfection. It's about awareness. Use it regularly to check DNA health. Don't wait for problems to become obvious. Monitor system health. Read system signals. Pay attention to early warning indicators.

But here's what's crucial: DNA health isn't just about presence. It's about function. It's about interaction. It's about emergence. You can have all six elements present, but if they're not functioning systemically, if they're not interacting, if Apostolic Genius isn't emerging, the system isn't healthy.

The goal is to maintain DNA health—to ensure all six elements are present and functioning, interacting systemically, enabling Apostolic Genius to emerge, adapting healthily while maintaining core identity. This is what it means to steward movement DNA as a living system.

In the next week, we're going to explore leverage points and feedback loops in depth—how they work, how to strengthen them, how to work with them. Understanding mDNA as a living system enables us to identify where real leverage is, where our interventions will have the most impact.

Because here's the thing: if mDNA is a living system, then not all interventions are created equal. Some have high leverage. Some have low leverage. Some actually make things worse. And understanding the system enables us to know the difference.
