# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **How would you assess your movement's DNA health?** Which of the six elements are present and functioning? Which might be missing or suppressed? Use the framework from this week to assess each element.

2. **Are the elements of mDNA interacting systemically in your movement, or are they operating as silos?** What evidence do you see? Do you see feedback loops between elements, or do they operate independently?

3. **Is Apostolic Genius emerging in your movement?** Can you feel that movemental energy, that mysterious dynamic that makes movement feel alive? Or does it feel more mechanical, more programmatic?

4. **Where do you see healthy DNA adaptation in your context?** Where is the DNA adapting to context while maintaining core identity? What does that look like?

5. **Where do you see DNA drift?** Where is the DNA losing core identity while trying to adapt? What's causing the drift?

6. **What would it mean for you to think about mDNA as a living system rather than a checklist?** How would that change your approach to working with movement DNA? What would you do differently?

7. **If you were to diagnose your movement's system health, what would you discover?** What are the vital signs telling you? What early warning signals do you see?

8. **What's your next step?** Based on your assessment, what needs attention? What would help your movement's DNA function as a living system?
