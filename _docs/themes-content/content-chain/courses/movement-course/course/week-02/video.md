**Video Focus:** Movement DNA as a Living System

**Content Description:**
This video would explore how the six elements of mDNA function as a living system, not just a checklist. It would explain emergent properties—how Apostolic Genius emerges when the system comes alive. It would demonstrate how the elements interact systemically, creating feedback loops with each other. It would show how to diagnose system health, how to read system signals, how to recognize when the system is functioning as a living system.

**Key Points:**
- mDNA is a living system, not a checklist
- The six elements interact systemically, creating feedback loops
- Apostolic Genius is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges
- System health diagnostics: reading the vital signs
- mDNA suppression and reactivation

**Connection to Week's Themes:**
This video would make the abstract concept of "living system" more concrete and visual. It would help participants see how the elements work together, how feedback loops function, and how to recognize when the system is healthy or unhealthy. It would ground the week's reading in practical examples and visual demonstrations.
