# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you identify where you are in your journey and what questions you're bringing.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify leverage points in their movement—where are they currently intervening? What leverage do those interventions have? Where could they intervene for greater impact? What feedback loops are functioning well? Which need strengthening?

**Sample Prompts:**
- Where are you currently intervening in your movement? What changes are you making? What leverage do those interventions have?
- What feedback loops do you see functioning in your movement? Which reinforcing loops are creating multiplication? Which balancing loops are maintaining coherence?
- Where do you see delays in your system? How are you accounting for them? What interventions have you made that haven't shown results yet?
- If you were to identify the highest leverage point in your movement right now, what would it be? What would it mean to intervene there?
- What would it mean to strengthen the reinforcing loops in your movement? What would that look like? What would need to change?
- What balancing loops are maintaining coherence in your movement? Are they too strong or too weak? How do you know?

**Conversation Objectives:**
- Participants identify where they're currently intervening and assess the leverage of those interventions
- Participants recognize feedback loops functioning in their movement
- Participants identify leverage points where they could intervene for greater impact
- Participants discover how to strengthen reinforcing loops and balance balancing loops
- Participants identify one concrete leverage point where they could intervene
