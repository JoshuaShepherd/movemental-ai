# Anchor Scripture: Mark 4:26-29

> "He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.'"  
> —Mark 4:26-29

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we dive into this week's content, I want to invite you to spend time with this parable from Mark's Gospel. It's one of Jesus' most profound teachings about how the kingdom works—and it reveals something essential about how systems actually function.

Take a moment. Read it slowly. Let it sink in.

*A man scatters seed on the ground...*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the phrase "though he does not know how." What does it mean that growth happens in ways we can't fully understand or control? What does this teach us about system emergence?

Read it a third time, focusing on "All by itself the soil produces grain." What does it mean that systems have their own dynamics, their own processes, their own way of working? What does this teach us about feedback loops and system behavior?

Read it one more time, focusing on the progression: "first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head." What does it mean that systems have delays, that growth happens in stages, that we can't rush the process? What does this teach us about working with system dynamics?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just leverage points and feedback loops as abstract concepts, but as the actual dynamics that make movements work—the reinforcing loops that create multiplication, the balancing loops that maintain coherence, the leverage points where small interventions create large effects, the delays that make systems counterintuitive.

Because here's what I want you to see: if the kingdom works like a seed growing—if it has its own dynamics, its own processes, its own way of working—then movement systems work the same way. They have feedback loops that create growth. They have leverage points where intervention matters. They have delays that require patience. And understanding these dynamics helps us work with systems rather than against them.

Everything has its time. Everything has its process. Everything has its dynamics.

Even movement systems. Especially movement systems.
