# Looking Ahead

In the next week, we're going to explore **Scaling and System Life Cycles**. This is where systems thinking gets really practical for movement leaders who are dealing with growth and multiplication.

We're going to learn about fractal systems—how DNA repeats at every scale. We're going to explore multiplication of multiplication—not just expressions multiplying, but movements creating movements. We're going to understand why movements institutionalize and how to prevent it—or how to enable renewal when it happens. We're going to learn about system equilibrium and how it kills movemental energy.

But before we get there, take a moment. Breathe. Remember: understanding leverage points and feedback loops is the foundation for understanding scaling. You can't scale effectively if you don't understand where leverage is and how feedback loops work. Now we're going to apply that understanding to the challenge of scaling.

The system is there. The leverage points are there. The feedback loops are functioning (or need to function).

Now we need to understand how to scale. We need to understand system life cycles. We need to enable multiplication at scale.

The journey continues. The journey deepens. The journey transforms.

And it all flows from him, through him, and for him.

Everything. Always. Forever.
