# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **Where are you currently intervening in your movement?** What changes are you making? What leverage do those interventions have? Are you focusing on low leverage points (parameters, buffers) or high leverage points (goals, paradigms)?

2. **What feedback loops do you see functioning in your movement?** Which reinforcing loops are creating multiplication? Which balancing loops are maintaining coherence? How are they working together?

3. **Where do you see delays in your system?** How are you accounting for them? What interventions have you made that haven't shown results yet? How are you monitoring for delayed effects?

4. **If you were to identify the highest leverage point in your movement right now, what would it be?** What would it mean to intervene there? What would need to change?

5. **What would it mean to strengthen the reinforcing loops in your movement?** What would that look like? What would need to change? What barriers to reproduction need to be removed?

6. **What balancing loops are maintaining coherence in your movement?** Are they too strong or too weak? How do you know? What's the right balance for your movement right now?

7. **How does the parable of the growing seed (Mark 4:26-29) speak to you right now?** What does it teach you about working with system dynamics? About patience? About emergence?

8. **What's your next step?** Based on your understanding of leverage points and feedback loops, where will you focus your energy? What intervention will you make?
