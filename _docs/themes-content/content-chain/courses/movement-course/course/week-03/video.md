**Video Focus:** Leverage Points and Feedback Loops

**Content Description:**
This video would explain the twelve leverage points in accessible ways, showing why the most obvious interventions often have the least leverage. It would demonstrate reinforcing and balancing loops using movement examples. It would show how to read feedback signals, how to strengthen loops, how to work with delays. It would help participants see their movements through the lens of leverage points and feedback loops.

**Key Points:**
- The twelve leverage points (from least to most effective)
- Why obvious interventions often have low leverage
- Reinforcing loops: the engine of multiplication
- Balancing loops: maintaining DNA coherence
- System delays: working with time gaps
- Reading feedback signals

**Connection to Week's Themes:**
This video would make leverage points and feedback loops more concrete and visual. It would help participants see where they're currently intervening and where they could intervene for greater impact. It would demonstrate how feedback loops function in movements and how to work with them effectively.
