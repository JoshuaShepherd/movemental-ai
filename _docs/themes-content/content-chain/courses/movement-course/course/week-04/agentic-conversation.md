# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you understand scaling dynamics and system life cycles in your movement.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify scaling bottlenecks in their movement, assess whether their system is moving toward equilibrium, and explore strategies for maintaining multiplication and enabling renewal.

**Sample Prompts:**
- Where is your movement currently experiencing multiplication? Where is it stalling or hitting limits?
- Can you identify any bottlenecks that are preventing further scaling? (Leadership capacity, DNA coherence, resources, contextual adaptation, system complexity)
- Is your movement's DNA simple enough to replicate at every scale? Or does it require complex systems to maintain?
- What signs of equilibrium do you see in your movement? (Slowing multiplication, DNA drift, risk aversion, centralization, program focus, maintenance over mission)
- If your movement is moving toward equilibrium, what would it take to break that equilibrium and restore movemental energy?
- How are you maintaining DNA coherence across scales? Are you using simple rules or complex programs?
- What would "multiplication of multiplication" look like in your context? (Not just disciples making disciples, but movements creating movements)
- How are you building distributed capacity to enable scaling without centralization?
