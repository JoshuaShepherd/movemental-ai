# Anchor Scripture: Matthew 13:31-33

> "He told them another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.' He told them still another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.'"  
> —Matthew 13:31-33

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

Before we dive into this week's content, I want to invite you to spend time with these parables from Matthew's Gospel. They're two of Jesus' most powerful teachings about how the kingdom scales—and they reveal something essential about how movement systems scale.

Take a moment. Read them slowly. Let them sink in.

*The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed...*

Now read it again, this time focusing on the phrase "though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants." What does it mean that something so small can become so large? What does this teach us about fractal scaling—the same pattern repeating at every scale?

Read it a third time, focusing on "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough." What does it mean that the yeast works "all through the dough"? What does this teach us about how DNA spreads through a system, maintaining coherence while enabling multiplication?

Read it one more time, focusing on the progression: small seed becomes large tree, small amount of yeast works through all the dough. What does it mean that scaling happens through replication, not just growth? What does this teach us about multiplication of multiplication?

This is what we're about to explore together. Not just scaling as getting bigger, but scaling as multiplication—the same DNA repeating at every scale, the same pattern working through the whole system, the same simple rules enabling complex emergence.

Because here's what I want you to see: if the kingdom scales like a mustard seed and like yeast—if it starts small and works through everything—then movement systems scale the same way. They multiply through replication, not just growth. They maintain DNA at every scale. They enable multiplication of multiplication.

Everything scales. Everything multiplies. Everything works through.

Even movement systems. Especially movement systems.
