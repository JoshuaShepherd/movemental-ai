# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **Where is your movement currently experiencing multiplication?** Where is it stalling or hitting limits? What bottlenecks are you encountering?

2. **Is your movement's DNA simple enough to replicate at every scale?** Or does it require complex systems, detailed procedures, or centralized resources to maintain? How might you simplify while maintaining depth?

3. **What signs of equilibrium do you see in your movement?** Are you seeing slowing multiplication, DNA drift, risk aversion, centralization, program focus, or maintenance replacing mission? What do these signs tell you about your system's current state?

4. **How are you maintaining DNA coherence across scales?** Are you using simple rules that enable adaptation, or complex programs that prevent it? What would it look like to shift toward simple rules?

5. **What would "multiplication of multiplication" look like in your context?** Not just disciples making disciples, but movements creating movements. What would need to change for this to happen?

6. **How are you building distributed capacity to enable scaling?** Are you developing distributed leadership, distributed resources, distributed decision-making? Or is capacity becoming centralized?

7. **If your movement is moving toward equilibrium, what would it take to break that equilibrium and restore movemental energy?** What would renewal look like? What would need to change?

8. **How do Jesus' parables of the mustard seed and leaven (Matthew 13:31-33) speak to your understanding of scaling?** What do they teach you about starting small, exponential growth, and the hidden influence of DNA?

9. **What is one practical step you will take this week to address a scaling bottleneck or prevent equilibrium in your movement?**
