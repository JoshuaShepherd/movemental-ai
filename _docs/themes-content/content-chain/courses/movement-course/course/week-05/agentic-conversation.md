# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you assess your movement's system architecture and APEST intelligence.*

**Focus:** Helps participants diagnose their current system architecture (organic vs. machine), identify missing APEST functions, and explore how to design for emergence rather than control.

**Sample Prompts:**
- Looking at your movement's current structures, would you describe them as more "organic" (self-organizing, adaptive, networked) or "machine" (hierarchical, controlled, standardized)? What evidence supports your assessment?
- What are the "simple rules" in your movement? Are they simple enough to be easily replicated, yet profound enough to guide complex behavior? Or are they complex procedures that require management?
- Which APEST functions are most clearly present and functioning in your movement? Which seem to be missing or suppressed? What blind spots might this be creating?
- How is intelligence distributed in your movement? Is decision-making concentrated at the center, or distributed throughout? How does this affect multiplication?
- What is the "path of least resistance" in your movement? What happens when people don't think about it—does the natural flow lead toward multiplication or stability?
- If you were to redesign your movement's architecture to enable emergence rather than control, what would need to change? What would you keep? What would you let go of?
- How would you describe your movement's APEST culture? Is it embedded in infrastructure, or just represented in roles? What would it take to build APEST as system infrastructure?
