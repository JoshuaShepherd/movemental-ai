# Anchor Scripture: Ephesians 4:11-13

> "And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

This week, as we explore system architecture and APEST intelligence, I invite you to sit with Paul's description of the fivefold functions from Ephesians 4. This isn't just a list of roles—it's a description of system infrastructure, of distributed intelligence, of how the body of Christ is designed to function.

Read the passage slowly, allowing the words to resonate.

*And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.*

As you read, consider these questions:
- What does it mean that these functions are "given" to the church? What does this tell you about their essential nature?
- How do these functions "equip the saints for the work of ministry"? What does this reveal about distributed capacity?
- What is the goal: "the fullness of Christ"? How do all five functions together enable this fullness?
- How does this passage challenge a hierarchical, centralized view of leadership and instead point to distributed intelligence?
- What does it mean that these functions are for "building up the body of Christ"? How does this connect to system architecture?

Let this scripture ground your understanding that APEST is not just about roles—it's about system intelligence, distributed capacity, and the infrastructure that enables the body of Christ to function as it was designed to function.
