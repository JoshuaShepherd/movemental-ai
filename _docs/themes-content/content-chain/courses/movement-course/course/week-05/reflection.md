# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **How would you describe your current leadership focus—more on managing what exists, or designing what should exist?** What would it look like to shift more toward design work? What would need to change?

2. **Looking at your movement's architecture, is it designed for emergence or control?** What evidence supports your assessment? What would need to change to enable more emergence?

3. **What are the "simple rules" in your movement?** Can they be stated clearly? Can they be passed from person to person? Can they be adapted to context while maintaining coherence? If not, how might you simplify while maintaining depth?

4. **Which APEST functions are most clearly present and functioning in your movement?** Which seem to be missing or suppressed? What blind spots might this be creating? What system problems might be indicating missing intelligence?

5. **How is intelligence distributed in your movement?** Is decision-making concentrated at the center, or distributed throughout? How does this affect multiplication? What would it look like to distribute intelligence more fully?

6. **What is the "path of least resistance" in your movement?** What happens when people don't think about it—does the natural flow lead toward multiplication or stability? How could you redesign the path of least resistance to align with movement goals?

7. **How would you describe your movement's APEST culture?** Is it embedded in infrastructure, or just represented in roles? What would it take to build APEST as system infrastructure rather than just team composition?

8. **How does Ephesians 4:11-13 (the fivefold functions for system maturity) speak to your understanding of APEST as system intelligence architecture?** What does it mean that these functions are "given" to the church for "building up the body of Christ"?

9. **What is one practical step you will take this week to shift your movement's architecture toward enabling emergence rather than control?**
