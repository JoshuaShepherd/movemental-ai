# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you understand Metanoia as system transformation in your movement.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify where their movement is in the Metanoia Journey, assess whether they're engaging all three levels (Paradigm-Platform-Practices), and explore how to work with system resistance.

**Sample Prompts:**
- Where is your movement currently in the Metanoia Journey? Are you in the downcurve (unlearning) or the upcurve (relearning)? What signs indicate this?
- Looking at your movement's transformation efforts, are you engaging all three levels (Paradigm-Platform-Practices) or just tweaking at one level? What evidence supports your assessment?
- What resistance are you experiencing to transformation? Is it paradigm resistance, platform resistance, or practice resistance? How might you work with this resistance rather than against it?
- How are all five APEST functions contributing to your movement's transformation? Which functions might be missing or suppressed? What blind spots might this be creating?
- What new feedback loops do you need to build to reinforce transformation? What old feedback loops might be pulling the system back?
- If your movement is in the downcurve (unlearning), what needs to be let go of? What needs to be cleared? What space needs to be made?
- If your movement is in the upcurve (relearning), what new patterns are emerging? What new feedback loops are forming? How can you strengthen them?
