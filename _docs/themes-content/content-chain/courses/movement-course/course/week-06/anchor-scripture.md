# Anchor Scripture: Romans 12:1-2

> "I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

## Reading Practice: Meditative Reading

This week, as we explore Metanoia as System Transformation, I invite you to sit with Paul's powerful call to transformation from Romans 12. This passage speaks directly to the deep change required for system transformation—not just surface-level tweaking, but fundamental renewal.

Read the passage slowly, allowing the words to resonate.

*I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.*

As you read, consider these questions:
- What does it mean to be "transformed by the renewal of your mind"? How does this connect to paradigm shift?
- What is the difference between being "conformed" and being "transformed"? How does this speak to system change vs. system tweaking?
- How does "renewal of your mind" connect to the three levels of transformation: Paradigm (mind), Platform (soul), Practices (will)?
- What does it mean to "discern what is the will of God" through testing? How does this connect to the experimental nature of system transformation?
- How does this passage challenge us to resist the pull of "this world" (system equilibrium) and instead embrace transformation?

Let this scripture ground your understanding that system transformation is not just organizational change—it's spiritual transformation, requiring the renewal of mind, soul, and will.
