# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **Where is your movement currently in the Metanoia Journey?** Are you in the downcurve (unlearning) or the upcurve (relearning)? What signs indicate this? What does this mean for how you approach transformation?

2. **Looking at your movement's transformation efforts, are you engaging all three levels (Paradigm-Platform-Practices) or just tweaking at one level?** What evidence supports your assessment? What would it look like to engage all three levels together?

3. **What resistance are you experiencing to transformation?** Is it paradigm resistance (the system doesn't see the need), platform resistance (structures make change hard), or practice resistance (behaviors are hard to change)? How might you work with this resistance rather than against it?

4. **How are all five APEST functions contributing to your movement's transformation?** Which functions might be missing or suppressed? What blind spots might this be creating? How can you ensure all five are present and functioning?

5. **What new feedback loops do you need to build to reinforce transformation?** What old feedback loops might be pulling the system back? How can you create new reinforcing loops that reward new behaviors?

6. **If your movement is in the downcurve (unlearning), what needs to be let go of?** What needs to be cleared? What space needs to be made? How can you create the disequilibrium necessary for transformation?

7. **If your movement is in the upcurve (relearning), what new patterns are emerging?** What new feedback loops are forming? How can you strengthen them? How can you make the new patterns self-reinforcing?

8. **How does Romans 12:1-2 (transformation through renewal of mind) speak to your understanding of Metanoia as system transformation?** What does it mean to be "transformed by the renewal of your mind" at the system level?

9. **What is one practical step you will take this week to engage all three levels of transformation in your movement?**
