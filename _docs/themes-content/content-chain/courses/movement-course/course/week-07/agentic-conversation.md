# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you navigate advanced system challenges in your movement.*

**Focus:** Helps participants identify multi-system dynamics in their movement, assess how they're responding to VUCA environments, and explore how to build resilience and antifragility.

**Sample Prompts:**
- How is your movement functioning as a system-of-systems? What are the different levels (local, city, regional, global)? How do they connect?
- What interfaces exist between systems in your movement? Are they enabling connection without control, or creating dependencies and bottlenecks?
- How is your movement responding to VUCA environments? Is it designed for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, or for stability, predictability, simplicity, and clarity?
- What challenges in your movement are technical problems (have known solutions) vs. adaptive challenges (require learning and transformation)? How does this affect how you approach them?
- How resilient is your movement? Can it recover from shocks? How antifragile is it? Does it get stronger from stress, or just survive it?
- How are you maintaining coherence across system boundaries? Are you using simple rules or complex programs? How is this working?
- What would it look like to build more antifragility into your movement? What would need to change?
