# Anchor Scripture: 1 Corinthians 9:19-23

> "For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings."

## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

This week, as we explore advanced system challenges—multi-system dynamics, VUCA environments, and adaptive challenges—I invite you to sit with Paul's description of adaptive engagement from 1 Corinthians 9. This passage reveals profound systems wisdom about how to navigate complex, changing contexts.

Read the passage slowly, allowing the words to resonate.

*For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.*

As you read, consider these questions:
- What does this passage reveal about adaptive engagement with different contexts? How does Paul adapt his approach while maintaining core identity?
- How does "becoming all things to all people" connect to the challenge of maintaining DNA coherence across different systems and contexts?
- What does it mean to adapt "for the sake of the gospel"? How does this connect to maintaining purpose while adapting to context?
- How does this passage challenge a one-size-fits-all approach and instead point to contextual adaptation?
- What does it mean to be "under the law of Christ" while adapting to different contexts? How does this connect to maintaining core DNA while enabling local variation?

Let this scripture ground your understanding that advanced system challenges require adaptive engagement—maintaining core identity while adapting to context, preserving DNA while enabling local variation, staying faithful while responding to complexity.
