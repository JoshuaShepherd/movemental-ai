# Looking Ahead

This week, we've explored advanced system challenges—multi-system dynamics, VUCA environments, adaptive challenges, and system resilience. We've seen how movements function as systems of systems, how they must navigate volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environments, and how they need to be antifragile, not just resilient.

But here's the crucial question: **how do we become movement system architects?** How do we think with the mind of Christ about systems? How do we develop "system eyes"? How do we build system literacy in teams? How do we steward movement-ology for the next generation?

Next week, we'll explore **Becoming Movement System Architects**—the role shift from manager to architect, thinking with the mind of Christ about systems, developing system sensing, and building the infrastructure needed to pass on movement-ology wisdom to the next generation.

This is where the journey culminates. This is where we become the architects our movements need. The journey continues. The transformation completes. The commissioning begins.
