# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **How is your movement functioning as a system-of-systems?** What are the different levels (local, city, regional, global)? How do they connect? How do they maintain their own identity while contributing to the larger whole?

2. **What interfaces exist between systems in your movement?** Are they enabling connection without control, or creating dependencies and bottlenecks? How could you improve these interfaces?

3. **How is your movement responding to VUCA environments?** Is it designed for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, or for stability, predictability, simplicity, and clarity? What evidence supports your assessment?

4. **What challenges in your movement are technical problems (have known solutions) vs. adaptive challenges (require learning and transformation)?** How does this distinction affect how you approach them? Are you trying to solve adaptive challenges with technical solutions?

5. **How resilient is your movement?** Can it recover from shocks? How antifragile is it? Does it get stronger from stress, or just survive it? What would it look like to build more antifragility?

6. **How are you maintaining coherence across system boundaries?** Are you using simple rules or complex programs? How is this working? What would it look like to shift toward simple rules?

7. **How does 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 (adaptive engagement with different contexts) speak to your understanding of navigating multi-system dynamics and VUCA environments?** What does it mean to adapt while maintaining core identity?

8. **What is one practical step you will take this week to build more resilience or antifragility into your movement?**
