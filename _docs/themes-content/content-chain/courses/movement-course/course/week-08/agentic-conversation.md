# Agentic Conversation

*This section will be facilitated through an interactive AI conversation designed to help you become a movement system architect and think with the mind of Christ about systems.*

**Focus:** Helps participants assess their current state (manager vs. architect), identify next steps for developing system architecture capacity, and explore how to think with the mind of Christ about systems.

**Sample Prompts:**
- How would you describe your current leadership approach—more like a manager (maintaining what exists) or an architect (designing what should exist)? What evidence supports your assessment?
- What would it look like to make the shift from manager to architect? What mindset changes would be needed? What skills would you need to develop?
- How are you currently thinking about systems—just technically, or also theologically? How does Christo-logic inform your systems thinking?
- What "system eyes" have you developed? What patterns do you notice? What dynamics do you sense? How can you develop this capacity further?
- How are you building system literacy in your teams? What would it look like to have a team that thinks systemically, not just you?
- What infrastructure do you need to steward movement-ology wisdom for the next generation? How are you passing on what you've learned?
- How does having "the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16) change how you see systems, understand them, and intervene in them?
- What is one concrete step you will take to become more of a movement system architect?
