## Reading Practice: Contemplative Reading

This final week, as we explore becoming movement system architects and thinking with the mind of Christ about systems, I invite you to sit with Paul's profound claim: "we have the mind of Christ."

Read the passage slowly, allowing the words to resonate.

*For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.*

As you read, consider these questions:
- What does it mean to "have the mind of Christ"? How does this connect to thinking about systems?
- How does having the mind of Christ change how we see systems, understand them, and intervene in them?
- What does it mean to think with Christo-logic—to see systems through the Logos, to understand system work as spiritual work?
- How does this passage challenge us to see systems not just as mechanisms, but as part of God's creative and redemptive work?
- What does it mean to be a movement system architect who thinks with the mind of Christ?

Let this scripture ground your understanding that becoming a movement system architect is not just about technical skill—it's about thinking with the mind of Christ, seeing systems through the Logos, understanding system work as spiritual work, and participating in God's creative and redemptive work through systems.
