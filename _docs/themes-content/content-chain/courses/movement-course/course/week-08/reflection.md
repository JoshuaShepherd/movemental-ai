# Reflection Questions

Take some time to reflect on these questions. You might want to journal your responses, or discuss them with others who are on this journey with you.

1. **How would you describe your current leadership approach—more like a manager (maintaining what exists) or an architect (designing what should exist)?** What evidence supports your assessment? What would it look like to make the shift?

2. **What would it take for you to become more of a movement system architect?** What mindset changes would be needed? What skills would you need to develop? What practices would you need to adopt?

3. **How are you currently thinking about systems—just technically, or also theologically?** How does Christo-logic inform your systems thinking? How does having "the mind of Christ" change how you see systems?

4. **What "system eyes" have you developed through this course?** What patterns do you notice? What dynamics do you sense? How can you develop this capacity further?

5. **How are you building system literacy in your teams?** What would it look like to have a team that thinks systemically, not just you? What would you need to teach? What would you need to share?

6. **What infrastructure do you need to steward movement-ology wisdom for the next generation?** How are you passing on what you've learned? How are you enabling the next generation to build on what you've discovered?

7. **How does 1 Corinthians 2:16 ("we have the mind of Christ") speak to your understanding of becoming a movement system architect?** What does it mean to think with the mind of Christ about systems?

8. **What is one concrete step you will take to become more of a movement system architect?** What will you do differently? What will you focus on? What will you let go of?

9. **How has this course transformed your understanding of movement leadership?** What will you carry forward? What will you continue to explore? What questions remain?
