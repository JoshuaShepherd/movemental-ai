  - Result: rediscovered power of core message
  - Movement born
  - Faith linked in utter simplicity to Jesus
  - At heart of all great movements: recovery of simple Christology
  - Accurately reflects Jesus of New Testament faith
  - They are in very literal sense "Jesus movements"
  - Something else unleashed: capacity to rapidly transfer message along relational lines
  - Freed from philosophical density of academic language and dependence on professional cleric
  - Gospel becomes profoundly "sneezable"
  - Ideas spread in patterns similar to viral epidemics
  - To become "epidemic," must be easily transferred from one person to another
  - Profound yet simple - easily grasped by any person, including illiterate peasants
  - Gospel becomes possession of the people, not purely of religious institutions
  - Desperate, prayer-soaked human clinging to Jesus
  - Reliance on his Spirit
  - Distillation of gospel message into simple, uncluttered message of Jesus as Lord and Savior
  - This catalyzed missional potencies inherent in people of God

  - Pass foreboding tree: imposing trees thought to contain nasty spirits called dryads
  - Need prescribed ritual to appease dryad
  - River goddess: particularly unpredictable deity, must be placated with sacrifice
  - Simple action of going to river was actually quite religiously complex process
  - Polytheistic view extended to every sphere: economics, state (politics), family, war, fertility
  - Life as polytheist: complex, superstitious, dangerous
  - Used to illustrate context into which Shema came

### Chapter 5: Disciple Making

**Story: The Wesleyan Movement**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Historical movement case study
- **Maps to Concepts**: Disciple Making, Apostolic Ministry, The Fractal Nature of Missional Movement
- **Details**: 
  - Founded in 18th-century Britain by John Wesley
  - Following life-changing encounter with God, Wesley began traveling throughout Great Britain
  - Vision: conversion and discipling of a nation and renewal of fallen church
  - "Sought no less than the recovery of the truth, life and power of earliest Christianity and the expansion of that kind of Christianity"
  - Within a generation, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist
  - Movement becoming worldwide phenomenon
  - Key to success: high level of commitment to Methodist cause expected of participants
  - Cause declined to degree that movement moved away from original missional ethos of evangelism and disciple making
  - Degenerated into mere religious legalism maintained by institution, rule books, highly professionalized clergy
  - Methodism in America: experienced massive exponential growth (35% of population in around 40 years)
  - Two critical "movement killers" introduced:
    1. In 1850: leaders tired of Episcopalians and Presbyterians deriding them as "uncouth and unlearned" ministers
       - Decided all circuit riders and local ministers had to complete four years of ordination studies to qualify
       - Growth ceased straightaway
    2. Ten years later (1860): no longer required classes and bands
       - Discipleship had become optional extra
  - Methodism has been in decline in relation to percentage of population ever since

**Story: Church Multiplication Associates (CMA) - Discipleship Focus**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Contemporary movement case study
- **Maps to Concepts**: Disciple Making, Disciplism, Organic Systems
- **Details**: 
  - Key to remarkable growth to 500 churches in few short years: resolute commitment to discipleship
  - Early period: "We started articulating this profound goal for CMA: 'We want to lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple.'"
  - Rationale: if experience of church so simple that just about anyone can do it, and church made up of people who have taken up their cross and follow Jesus at any cost, result will be movement that empowers common Christian to do uncommon works of God
  - "Churches will become healthy, fertile, and reproductive"
  - Many current practices seem wrong way around: make church complex and discipleship too easy
  - Developed concept of Life Transformation Groups (LTGs)
  - Very simple, duplicable, disciple-making system used worldwide
  - Because of simplicity and reproducibility, brought many people closer to Jesus and growth to CMA's movement
  - LTG involves: staple of Bible reading, storytelling, personal accountability, and prayer
  - Required that all who call themselves Christians be in an LTG
  - Not just in initial phases of Christian life - ongoing commitment for all involved
  - Including leadership at every level
  - CMA basically a disciple-making movement
  - Neil claims: essentially this combination of organic ideas of organization and primary commitment to discipling the nations led to remarkable growth

**Story: Soma Communities and NewThing Network**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Contemporary movement case studies

  - **Soma Communities**: 
    - Require high levels of discipleship throughout system
    - Everyone commits to common practices laced throughout various missional communities
    - Form building blocks of entire movement
    - Mere attendance at Sunday worship de-emphasized in favor of commitment to individual and communal discipleship
  - **NewThing Network**: 
    - Places more emphasis on apprenticing and developing new leaders as unavoidable aspect of system (leadership pipeline)
    - Person can become leader in movement only by being apprenticed and apprenticing others in return
    - Was growing exponentially at time of writing
  - Both rapidly growing movements in West that take discipleship seriously

**Story: Alan and Deb at Burning Man**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Personal experience / Cultural engagement
- **Maps to Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, From Attractional to Missional
- **Details**: 
  - Alan and Deb regularly go to Burning Man
  - Find it one of most spiritually open experiences they have ever encountered
  - Alternative spiritualities are challenges to mainline Christianity
  - But major threat to viability of faith is consumerism
  - Far more serious and insidious challenge to gospel
  - Infects each and every one of us

**Story: Alan's Marketing Background**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Personal background
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - supports understanding of consumerism challenge)
- **Details**: 
  - Alan trained as marketer and advertiser before coming to Christ
  - When looks at power of consumerism and market in our lives, has little doubt that in consumerism we are dealing with very significant religious phenomenon
  - If role of religion is to offer sense of identity, purpose, meaning, and community, then consumerism fulfills all these criteria
  - Because of competitive nature of market, advertisers have become so insidious that they are now deliberately co-opting theological ideas and religious symbols to sell products
  - Marketers are official priesthood of new and all-pervasive religion
  - Assimilation of religious symbols and rituals serves to bolster advertising's appeal to spiritual dimension of life
  - Advertising executive recently confessed to Alan that advertisers are now deliberately stepping into void left by removal of Christianity from Western culture

**Story: Douglas Rushkoff and The Persuaders**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Cultural analysis / Documentary reference
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - supports understanding of consumerism challenge)
- **Details**: 
  - Astute cultural commentator Douglas Rushkoff, in PBS documentary on consumerism "The Persuaders"
  - Noted that advertisers and marketers are now learning from religion in order to sell products
  - Marketers have now co-opted language and symbolism of all major religions to sell products
  - Because they know that religion offers ultimate object of desire and people will do just about anything to get it
  - If through advertising marketers can just link their products to this great unfilled void, they will sell
  - Advertising now makes explicit offer of identity, meaning, purpose, and community
  - Most ads now appeal to one or more of these religious dimensions of life

**Story: Car Advertisement Example**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5
- **Type**: Cultural example / Advertising analysis
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - illustrates consumerism challenge)
- **Details**: 
  - Recent car ad in Alan's country (Australia)
  - Introduced to fantastic community of very cool people singing along in car and generally having great time
  - Throughout ad, nothing mentioned about qualities of car, technical capacities, availability, price
  - Advertisement is explicit appeal to need for people to be accepted as cool people
  - Selling point: offer of community, status, and acceptance by other hip people
  - Message: if consumer would just purchase this vehicle, he or she will achieve this goal
  - Analyzed in religious way: could see just about all advertising in this light
  - Buy this and you will be changed
  - Levi Strauss even used idea of being born again through purchase of their products

### Chapter 6: Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Story: Jeff Shaffer and Uffizi Order**
- **Citation**: The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 6
- **Type**: Contemporary ministry case study
- **Maps to Concepts**: Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Ministry, Prophetic Ministry, Apostolic Environment
- **Details**: 
  - Alan was recently at a meeting celebrating ten years of the Uffizi Order
  - Agency founded by Jeff Shaffer
  - Dedicated to incarnational mission in Santa Barbara
  - In his speech, Jeff made observation: "I have always felt at odds with the system. I have always felt that the church was meant to provide the answers to all of society's issues. To do something that changes the status quo. I have always felt the need to take the message of Jesus into all the nooks and crannies of Santa Barbara, to the very places where the church has had little or no interest and even less impact. As an apostolic and prophetic agency, Uffizi Order exists to transform Santa Barbara into a little outpost of the kingdom; to eliminate homelessness, to stop trafficking, to plant churches, see people saved, and to bring tangible justice to those who are rejected and oppressed in any way. We are responsible, we will go, we will do whatever it takes."
  - Alan could not help thinking that he was sensing in Jeff the selfsame energies that imbue missional movements in every time and place

## The Shaping of Things to Come

### Chapter 1: Evolution or Revolution?

**Story: Burning Man Festival**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Cultural phenomenon / Case study
- **Maps to Concepts**: Liminality-Communitas, From Attractional to Missional, Missional-Incarnational Impulse
- **Details**: 
  - Annual pilgrimage to Burning Man builds to crescendo
  - On playa, four-hundred-square-mile, flat-floored basin known as Black Rock Desert
  - Each year thousands of artists, musicians, bohemians, punks, taggers, rappers, and other artistes journey into 107-degree heat of desert
  - Festival like no other
  - Temporary community of people committed to generosity, environmentalism, celebration, spirituality, and above all, art
  - Been so successful over past 20 or so years that it has come to represent trends that pose greatest challenges to Christian church
  - Dares to offer acceptance, community, experience of god, redemption, and atonement
  - Resembles everything church is supposed to offer
  - Many people finding transformative power of Burning Man far and away more effective than anything they experience in church
  - Christians might be tempted to focus on and condemn Burning Man's patently pagan elements
  - But should rather examine what takes place to learn why thousands flock to event every year
  - Alan and his wife Debra journeyed to desert themselves recently
  - Along with members of their church, The Tribe of LA
  - Entered fully into Burning Man experience for its own sake, but also as kind of exercise in anthropological research
  - What drew people to Burning Man? What longings were met on floor of Black Rock Desert?
  - According to participants, six key elements make up Burning Man experience:
    1. **Belonging**: You belong here and you participate. You're not the weirdest kid in the classroom. You're there to breathe art. You're here to build a community that needs you and relies on you.
    2. **Survival**: Not for the fainthearted. Involves venturing into desert and surviving without restaurants, air conditioning, or shopping malls. With all comforts of home stripped away, participants have no choice but to look deep within themselves, discover who they truly are, summon up will and power to survive.
    3. **Empowerment**: You're here to create. Since nobody at Burning Man is a spectator, you're here to build your own new world. No one is deemed to be without talent.
    4. **Sensuality**: Highly sensual, experiential community. You're here to experience.
    5. **Celebration**: Crescendo of festival is burning of large human effigy in middle of camp. As Burning Man goes up in flames, participants experience deeply spiritual sensation. As founder Larry Harvey says: "As the procession starts, the circle forms, and the man ignites, you experience something personal, something new to yourself, something you've never felt before. It's an epiphany, it's primal, it's newborn. And it's completely individual." Artists cast their art works into flames. There is apparently a purging, a form of atonement, and sense of liberation and joy.
    6. **Liminality**: Word liminal from Latin limen (threshold) signifies in-between time. Often used by anthropologists to describe period between childhood and adulthood. Refers to transitional, temporary period of human transformation. Burning Man community appears in August and takes over seemingly untouched playa, then leaves in September, removing any trace that it was ever there. First-timers instructed: "You'll leave as you came. When you depart from Burning Man, you leave no trace. Everything you built, you dismantle. The waste you make and the objects you consume leave with you. Volunteers will stay for weeks to return the Black Rock Desert to its pristine condition. But you'll take the world you built with you."
  - Opening with Burning Man impressions because it and festivals like it around world seem to be saying something important to world in general and to church specifically
  - Burning Man is cry from emerging postmodern generation for community of belonging, spirituality, sensuality, empowerment, and liberation
  - Once you've been to Nevada desert and tasted something as overwhelming as Burning Man, what does contemporary traditional church have to offer you?
  - Authors take view that transformative power of gospel of Jesus Christ is greater than anything offered at Black Rock
  - But realistic enough to admit that unless church recovers its role as subversive, missionary movement, no one who has been to Burning Man will be least bit interested in it

**Story: Fight Club Film**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Cultural reference / Film analysis
- **Maps to Concepts**: Liminality-Communitas, From Attractional to Missional
- **Details**: 
  - Same people who first told authors about Burning Man also spoke with gusto about their favorite film, Fight Club
  - Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton
  - In film, subversive community of young men begins to gather around charismatic figure Tyler Durden (played by both Pitt and Norton)
  - Under his manic leadership, club members meet to fight each other and inflict random acts of seditious violence on society
  - Theirs is community of male empowerment with strongly anticonsumerist sentiment
  - Like Burning Man festival, also about belonging, liberation, rebellion, and rejection of middle-class American values
  - Has untamed energy about it
  - Has dissident wildness about it
  - Authors know many young men who have been deeply affected by film
  - Might seem unsavory to many Christian people to be asked to learn something about need for emerging missional church by exploring Burning Man or Fight Club
  - But authors convinced both are prime examples of desperate yearning that has been unleashed in Western world over past few decades
  - During that time, advent of postmodernism has raised within West many expectations for experiential, activist form of religious, mystical experience
  - Christian church has not met these expectations
  - Contemporary traditional church increasingly seen as least likely option for those seeking artistic, politically subversive, activist community of mystical faith
  - Church can no longer write off emerging Burning Man generation as small subculture
  - While activities at Burning Man might not be everybody's cup of tea, yearnings it seeks to meet are much more common than church gives credence to

**Story: D. H. Lawrence Quote**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Historical quote / Cultural observation
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - historical observation about church)
- **Details**: 
  - D. H. Lawrence said as long ago as 1924: "The adventure has gone out of the Christian venture."
  - Then proposed that humankind create new venture toward hope
  - His aspirations still being played out to this day

**Story: A Tale of Two Pubs - Hamilton Hotel**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Church case study / Contrast example
- **Maps to Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional (negative example - what NOT to do)
- **Details**: 
  - Recently reported that congregation in small rural town in Australia had taken innovative step toward reaching its community
  - Melbourne newspaper announced: "Patrons of the Hamilton Hotel will soon be offered spirit of a different kind. In an unusual conversion, the town's Baptist congregation—who are teetotalers—have taken over one of the six pubs."
  - Hamilton community watched in amazement as pub, located on main street opposite local post office, was bought by Baptists and renovated into church and conference center
  - Front bar turned into recreation area for young people
  - Dance area rebuilt into chapel and meeting room
  - Bar transformed into coffee bar
  - Old pub now becoming alcohol-free building
  - In article, various church leaders from Melbourne and pastor of Hamilton Baptist Church spoke of relocation as innovative, creative, and daring
  - However, one sour note sounded
  - Midway through newspaper article, local from Hamilton quoted: "One of the hotel's former regulars, farmer Bruce McKellar, 71, said he would miss his corner of the bar. 'I would walk in and straight to it; we all had our own space,' he said."
  - Implied sadness of comment wasn't lost on authors
  - Farmer McKellar had been displaced from his personal seat at bar
  - Though he had probably moved on to one of other pubs, would never again be welcomed at his favorite watering hole
  - In Australia, like England, local pub is place of acceptance and friendship
  - Patrons develop allegiances to their pubs
  - Though they might visit another one occasionally, feel deep connection to their local
  - In Hamilton, farmers, tradesmen, and business people had been shooed out of Hamilton Hotel to make way for Baptists
  - This project, though appearing innovative, in fact reflects Christendom thinking
  - Assumes that church belongs prominently on main street
  - Claims that church has right to take over public space and clean out local people while creating so-called sanctified religious zone
  - Whether it's in pub, school auditorium, or two-hundred-year-old cathedral, represents same thinking

**Story: A Tale of Two Pubs - The Cock & Bottle, Bradford**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Missional church case study / Contrast example
- **Maps to Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Liminality-Communitas
- **Details**: 
  - On other side of planet, in English town of Bradford, another pub transformed by Christians
  - The Cock & Bottle is yellow, two-story English pub at bottom of street on corner of Bradford's inner ring road
  - Two years ago was rented by Bradford Christian Pub Consortium
  - Bradford is hardscrabble, working-class town
  - Has been noted in recent times for its racial conflict and street violence
  - But Cock & Bottle represents place of sanctuary and solace
  - Malcolm Willis has been employed by consortium to manage pub
  - He and his wife live upstairs above bar
  - He proves himself to be genuinely missional leader when he says: "Jesus said go into all the world. And this includes pubs. He didn't say sit in your church and wait for people to come to you."
  - Willises and their staff (all Christians) have set about creating loving, welcoming environment
  - Where locals are cared for, listened to, and ministered to
  - Says Willis: "Initially, many won't accept you talking about Jesus. Maybe after you've listened to them ten or twenty times—which can be exhausting—they might say 'Can you pray for me?' And then you see things happen."
  - Missional church always thinks of long haul rather than quick fix
  - Of course, dilemma about whether Christians should be serving alcohol or not is bound to arise
  - Willis is himself teetotaler, but has earthy and realistic outlook on issue of drinking
  - "Yes, we're selling booze to people who could do without it, but if we don't, they'll just go somewhere else—at least if they're here, we can get alongside them. I knew that when I came here I personally had to be seen not to drink, but I'm not everybody. Someone once showed me Proverbs 31, which says, 'Beer and wine are only for the dying or for those who have lost all hope. Let them drink and forget how poor and miserable they feel. But you must defend those who are helpless and have no hope.' So I have to ask, What would Jesus have done? I think the Lord would have been here in the pubs."
  - There is world of difference (and not just geographically) between Cock & Bottle and Hamilton Hotel
  - Former is missional, incarnational, and very risky
  - Latter is safe, demonstrates sound financial management (cheaper for Baptist Church to renovate pub than to build brand-new building)
  - But it is classic Christendom thinking

**Story: Swedish Church Example**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Statistical case study / Church decline example
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - illustrates church decline statistics)
- **Details**: 
  - Martin Robinson cites Swedish church as example
  - Notes that even though law that prohibited Swedish citizens leaving Church of Sweden was lifted in 1860, very few actually do
  - In fact, huge 95 percent of population are members of national church
  - However, recent study found that only 8 percent of all Swedes adhere to Christian worldview
  - When you consider that figure would undoubtedly comprise good number of 5 percent who have opted to join another church, there are very few official members of Church of Sweden who hold to its tenets
  - National church exists in name only
  - It is an artifice
  - Same can be said of other Western European nations

**Story: William Diehl - The Sales Manager**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Personal testimony / Credibility gap example
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - illustrates sacred/secular divide problem)
- **Details**: 
  - William Diehl, sales manager of major overseas steel corporation
  - Writes about gap between secular and sacred in church circles
  - In almost thirty years of professional career, his church has never once suggested that there be any type of accounting of his on-the-job ministry to others
  - Church has never once offered to improve those skills which could make him better minister
  - Nor has it ever asked if he needed any kind of support in what he was doing
  - There has never been inquiry into types of ethical decisions he must face, or whether he seeks to communicate faith to coworkers
  - He has never been in congregation where there was any type of public affirmation of ministry in his career
  - In short, must conclude that his church really doesn't have least interest whether or how he ministers in his daily work

**Story: Dan Mayhew and Summit Fellowships**
- **Citation**: The Shaping of Things to Come, Chapter 1
- **Type**: Leadership case study
- **Maps to Concepts**: Apostolic Environment, Starfish vs. Spider
- **Details**: 
  - Dan Mayhew works with Summit Fellowships in Portland, Oregon
  - Has come to understand that to minister to emerging generation of young people with authenticity, has had to completely flatten organization's leadership style
  - Says: "I make a distinction between hierarchy and 'heir-archy.' We are to be fellow heirs with one another. It's a bit of a play on words, but I think it conveys something very real. We are used to the systematic approach to things..."

## The Permanent Revolution

### Introduction

**Story: The Children of Men Movie - Parable of Church Infertility**
- **Citation**: The Permanent Revolution, Introduction
- **Type**: Film reference / Parabolic illustration
- **Maps to Concepts**: (Contextual - illustrates church decline/infertility problem)
- **Details**: 
  - In the movie "The Children of Men," there is a plague of infertility, and no one knows why
  - Diego Ricardo is the youngest person in the world: eighteen years, four months, twenty days, sixteen hours, and eight minutes old
  - He was the last human being to be born on earth
  - Since his birth, women everywhere have been unable to reproduce
  - When he suddenly dies, his demise is repeatedly broadcast and is viewed as a not-so-subtle reminder of the slowly creeping disaster that has undermined hope and created political disorder, social decay, radical doubt, and universal despair
  - The aging population is edging toward the end of the human race
  - In the story, Great Britain is one of the only places in the world that has managed to maintain a limited sense of order
  - People from everywhere have fled there, only to be rounded up as illegal refugees and transported to holding bins where they await deportation to the anarchy of Europe
  - Amid this chaos, Theo, a British citizen grown cynical and despairing in the surrounding hopelessness, is paid by a band of revolutionaries to escort Kee, a young woman, out of Britain and hand her over to an underground organization called the Human Project
  - Theo soon discovers that his mission is much riskier than he had expected, and he faces, and courageously evades, all kinds of traps to guard her from danger
  - But Theo is not told why his charge is so controversial
  - Clearly she has become the focus of militant groups, and his association with her has made him a prime target for violent attacks
  - It is not until he gets halfway to their destination that he finds out exactly who this woman is and why she is so important: Kee is pregnant, and the revolutionaries want to use her as a tool, a symbol of hope, a powerful weapon in a high-stakes political game to incite a revolution that would overthrow the government
  - Whatever sense of responsibility Theo felt toward his assignment in the beginning is now amplified as he realizes that the very future of humanity is in his custody
  - This is no ordinary assignment
  - He is to cross dangerous terrain, through uncharted territories, so that Kee can regenerate the human race
  - Theo is a custodian of life in a world of infertility
  - The Children of Men provides a parabolic pointer to a similar fruitlessness in the church throughout the West
  - To explain it, some have said that the vinedresser is simply pruning his vine or that he is judging some supposed unfaithfulness on our part, and that it will pass and our fertility will return
  - However we may want to figure it, we have to acknowledge that after almost twenty centuries of Christianity in Western contexts, we have generally not seen the kind of transformation implied in the gospel
  - Neither have we often approximated the vibrancy of the gospel movements that somehow manage to structure their ecclesial life much closer to the kind of church that Jesus designed it to be in the first place: that of an apostolic people movement; the kind of dynamic, fluid, viral, ecclesiology we see in the pages of the New Testament and throughout history
  - The early church, various movements over the centuries, and the developing world now (especially India and China) have displayed this same vitality
  - These are all great expressions of apostolic movement
  - Our situation today is not that dissimilar to the one described in The Children of Men
  - All of the statistical indicators show serious infertility in Western Christianity, and so we too are caught in a despairing spiral of trended numerical and spiritual decline in just about every context in the Western world

## ReJesus

### Chapter 7: The Legalism That Silenced the Pharisees

**Story: Michael's Friend in Sydney Cathedral**
- **Citation**: ReJesus, Chapter 7
- **Type**: Personal example / Contemporary practice
- **Maps to Concepts**: Jesus is Lord
- **Details**: 
  - Michael has a friend who works in a downtown office in Sydney
  - Takes his lunch two or three times a week to a nearby cathedral
  - Goes there to reflect on Jesus and enjoy the serenity of the place
  - He is free to sabbath as he wills
  - Jesus is Lord of all of life, of every day and every place
  - Used as example of how Jesus sets people free to enjoy regular times of retreat and reflection as tools to use as needed
  - While regular times of retreat and reflection are essential, they are tools for us to use as we need

**Story: Church in California Giving Away Harley-Davidson**
- **Citation**: ReJesus, Chapter 7
- **Type**: Church practice example / Consumerism critique
- **Maps to Concepts**: From Attractional to Missional (negative example - what NOT to do)
- **Details**: 
  - Authors heard of a church in California that gives away a Harley-Davidson motorbike each year
  - Given to the person who brings the most visitors to church
  - Used as example of how churches seeking to grow end up trying to attract a greater share of the market with advertising ploys and promises of better religious goods and services
  - Question raised: "Is this how Jesus mobilized his followers—by appealing to greed and self-interest?"
  - Contrasted with Jesus' approach: Jesus fashioned a community of devoted, selfless servants who sought to model their lives on his selflessness and service
  - In so doing, they became bound to each other in the bonds of a common cause
