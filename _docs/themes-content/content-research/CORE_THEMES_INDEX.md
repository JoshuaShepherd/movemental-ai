# The Core Themes of Alan Hirsch's Body of Work: A Comprehensive Index

*A systematic mapping and definition of the foundational themes that emerge from the corpus of Alan Hirsch's published works (2003-2024)*

---

## Introduction: What Lies at the Heart?

How do we account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in just two centuries? How did the underground church in China grow from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under the most severe persecution? What generative system undergirds these transformative movements, and more importantly, does it still lie dormant within the church today?

These questions launched my own quest to discover what I came to call Apostolic Genius—that mysterious, powerful, and reproducible system that transforms communities into world-changing movements. Over the course of more than two decades of writing, ministry, and reflection, certain themes have emerged and recurred throughout the corpus of work. Some themes are foundational, others are applications; some are theological, others are practical. But they are all interconnected, working together as an integrated whole, much like the elements of movement DNA (mDNA) itself.

What follows is a comprehensive mapping of these core themes as they appear across all thirteen published works, organized not alphabetically but by primacy and importance—because in the same way that "Jesus is Lord" forms the foundation for everything else, so too do these themes build upon one another in a logical and theological hierarchy.

I offer this index not as a final word but as a map for future exploration, a tool for those who would dig deeper into these ideas and apply them in their own contexts. Every theme listed here points back to specific texts, chapters, and sections where these ideas are developed more fully. Use this as your guide, but always return to the source texts themselves—there is no substitute for engaging with the ideas in their original context.

## Part One: The Foundational Themes

### 1. Jesus Is Lord: The Heart of It All

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 4, "The Heart of It All: Jesus Is Lord"
- **ReJesus** (2009, with Michael Frost): Throughout, especially Chapters 1-2, "How Jesus Changes Everything" and "ReJesus and Personal Renewal"
- **Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 1, "Jeebus Made Me Do It"
- **Disciplism** (2014): Chapter 6, "It's All About Jesus. No, Really, It Is."
- **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Appendix 1, "The Great Omission"
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 4, "Christo-Logic: Seeing the World from Inside the Mind That Created It"

**Full Definition:**

More than just an element of movement DNA, "Jesus is Lord" represents the absolute center from which all other themes radiate. This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that gives meaning and coherence to everything else. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems, but this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord.

The confession "Jesus is Lord" represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema Yisrael ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"). It touches on the nature of God, his relation to the world, and his covenantal relationship with his people. This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether Caesar, consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god. It is inherently political, inherently revolutionary, and inherently missional.

When movements distill their message under persecution, they discover that the gospel must be simple enough to be transferred from person to person, easily grasped by illiterate peasants, yet profound enough to transform entire cultures. This simplicity is not reductionism but essence—the core truth that all else depends upon. The early church and the Chinese underground church both discovered that when everything else is stripped away, what remains is Jesus: his person, his story, his claim on our lives.

This theme runs throughout the corpus, finding particular expression in the call to "reJesus" the church—to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms. Christology determines missiology, which in turn determines ecclesiology. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right, and we cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

The lordship of Jesus is not just a theological proposition to be assented to; it is a reality to be lived. It demands total allegiance, reshaping every dimension of life. It challenges the powers, subverts the status quo, and calls forth a community that lives as if this confession is actually true. This is why movements that maintain this centrality of Christ find themselves both persecuted and powerful—persecuted because they challenge false authorities, powerful because they tap into the very source of life itself.

### 2. Apostolic Genius and Movement DNA (mDNA)

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Introduction, Chapter 3 "Preparing for the Journey," and throughout
- **The Forgotten Ways Handbook** (2012, with Darryn Altclass): Throughout, as practical guide
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Chapter 4, "Apostolic Genius"
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Referenced throughout in relation to organizational transformation
- **The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Chapter 4 and throughout

**Full Definition:**

Apostolic Genius is that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy—those vibrant spiritual instincts—that exist within the people of God and can be activated to create transformative movements. The term itself was coined precisely because no existing word or phrase adequately captured this phenomenon. It describes the system that emerges from the dynamic interrelationship of all the key elements working together, creating something greater than the sum of its parts.

Movement DNA (mDNA) consists of six essential elements that must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to activate:
1. Jesus is Lord (the central confession)
2. Disciple-Making (multiplication through formation)
3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse (going out and going deep)
4. APEST Culture (the fivefold ministry environment)
5. Organic Systems (movemental structures)
6. Communitas (liminal community)

The DNA metaphor is intentionally chosen because, like biological DNA, mDNA:
- Is found in every living cell (present in every genuine expression of church)
- Contains all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism
- Is self-replicating (can be passed from one generation to the next)
- Carries vital information for healthy reproduction
- Can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated

Apostolic Genius is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges. It is what happens when all six elements of mDNA are present and functioning together. Like a smartphone operating system that represents a paradigmatic upgrade, Apostolic Genius represents a fundamentally different way of organizing and operating compared to institutional forms of church.

The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate. This is why churches can be doing many good things—good discipleship, good mission, good community—and still not experience the transformative power of movement.

Apostolic Genius is not something new to be created but something latent to be recovered. It is encoded in the very being of the church, a gift from God that has been forgotten but not lost. The future lies in the womb of the present; the potential for movement already exists within every expression of church, waiting to be awakened.

### 3. APEST / 5Q: The Fivefold Intelligence

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 8, "APEST Culture"
- **The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim): Comprehensive treatment throughout, especially Chapters 1-4
- **5Q: Reactivating the Original Intelligence and Capacity of the Body of Christ** (2017): Entire book dedicated to this theme
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout as part of Apostolic Genius
- **Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 5, "The Church That Jesus Built"
- **The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Integrated throughout

**Full Definition:**

APEST represents the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11, where Christ gives gifts to his church: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds (Pastors), and Teachers. In 5Q, this framework is expanded and deepened, revealing APEST not merely as ministry functions but as five forms of intelligence (5Q) that are both the primordial template for church life and universal archetypes present throughout human culture.

The fivefold functions operate as:
- **Apostle (AQ)**: Pioneering intelligence—extending, multiplying, architecting, mobilizing
- **Prophet (PQ)**: Discerning intelligence—challenging, calling to covenant faithfulness, exposing falsehood
- **Evangelist (EQ)**: Recruiting intelligence—gathering, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause
- **Shepherd (SQ)**: Nurturing intelligence—caring, protecting, building community, creating belonging
- **Teacher (TQ)**: Grounding intelligence—explaining, equipping, systematizing, preserving truth

These are not merely leadership roles but forms of organizational intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.

A critical insight developed in 5Q is that APEST functions are not limited to Christian contexts. They appear as universal archetypes throughout human culture—in business, arts, politics, education, and every domain of human endeavor. This is because they reflect the imago Dei, the image of God in humanity, and ultimately reflect aspects of God's own being. Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions, and the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature.

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. The "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents, while "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. Both are needed in dynamic tension.

5Q positions APEST as the "marks of a true church"—not the traditional institutional marks, but fivefold marks: apostolic (missional), prophetic (holy and just), evangelistic (proclaiming good news), shepherding (reconciled community), and teaching (wisdom and truth). These marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools, enabling leaders to assess organizational health and develop strategies for holistic maturity.

The framework has profound implications for leadership development, organizational structure, discipleship pathways, and the very nature of ministry. It calls for moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers, recognizing that every member of the Body has a vital role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world.

### 4. Discipleship and Disciple-Making: The Essential Practice

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 5, "Disciple Making"
- **Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Entire book focused on missional discipleship
- **Disciplism** (2014): Entire book dedicated to reframing evangelism within discipleship
- **ReJesus** (2009, with Michael Frost): Chapter 2, "ReJesus and Personal Renewal"
- **Right Here, Right Now** (2011, with Lance Ford): Integrated throughout
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 5, "Wholehearted Metanoia"

**Full Definition:**

Discipleship is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. He did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs—he made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was the foundational strategy from which the church would emerge. Discipleship is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move; it is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making.

Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us. Discipleship means learning to think, feel, and act like Jesus—not just knowing about him but knowing him and being known by him in the most intimate sense.

A critical insight developed in Disciplism is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

Disciplism addresses how contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach that fails to challenge the primary religion of most seekers. Jesus' ministry and early church practice demonstrate that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

The mDNA of discipleship involves several key elements: Jesus-shaped discipleship (centered on Christ's person and example), Shema spirituality (loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength), the inseparability of mission and discipleship (you cannot have one without the other), and the prophetic call to faithfulness (discipleship requires radical obedience).

Untamed explores obstacles to authentic discipleship in three areas: theology (false images of God and Jesus), culture (the subverting influence of consumerism, money, and status), and personal issues (identity, sexuality, family). Discipleship must be "untamed"—wild, radical, dangerous, matching the untamed nature of the Messiah we follow.

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact. Discipleship is not an optional extra for the committed few; it is the non-negotiable core practice of the church.

### 5. Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Going Out and Going Deep

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 6, "Missional-Incarnational Impulse"
- **Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 9, "Going Out, Going Deep"
- **Right Here, Right Now** (2011, with Lance Ford): Throughout
- **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Chapter 10, "Romancing the City"
- **Fast Forward to Mission** (2023): Both chapters, especially "Briefing Right Here"
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout

**Full Definition:**

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

The **missional impulse** refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people. This impulse is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

The missional impulse can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts. It is the sneeze that cannot be suppressed, the outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission. When this impulse is blocked—when churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches—they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact.

The **incarnational impulse** refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

Incarnational mission involves six key practices: **Presence** (full identification with culture), **Proximity** (geographic and relational closeness), **Powerlessness** (humility and vulnerability), **Prevenience** (recognizing God's work already present), **Passion** (embracing redemptive suffering), and **Proclamation** (sharing the good news). These practices enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

The missional-incarnational impulse is one of the most easily suppressed elements of mDNA, often replaced by what I call the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern. This pattern, while effective in certain contexts (m0-m1 on the missional scale), blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers. The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, and the church is intrinsically incarnational—it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

Fast Forward to Mission develops this into four movements: **Move Out** (into missional engagement), **Move In** (burrowing into culture through incarnation), **Move Alongside** (engaging in relationships and community), and **Move From** (challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture). These movements provide a practical framework for everyday mission in everyday contexts.

Reframation explores the practice of "romancing the city"—developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This involves the art of paying attention (like Moses at the burning bush), the art of listening (learning what "good news" means to each context), and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy that allows us to climb into another's skin and walk around in it.

The missional-incarnational impulse ensures that the church never becomes a fortress from the world but always remains a force for the world, engaging culture with both prophetic challenge and redemptive love.

### 6. Movement and Movement Dynamics: The Apostolic Form

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Throughout, especially Chapter 9 "Organic Systems"
- **The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim): Chapter 10, "Movements R Us"
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Throughout, especially Chapters 1, 9
- **The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Entire book
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Throughout, in relation to organizational transformation

**Full Definition:**

Movements are the quintessentially apostolic form of the church. They represent the way the church is designed to operate when Apostolic Genius is fully activated. A movement is more than an organization or institution—it is a living, breathing, reproducing organism that spreads like a virus, maintains its core DNA while adapting to contexts, and creates exponential rather than linear growth.

Movements are characterized by several key qualities: they thrive in an atmosphere of belief (people believe change is possible), they exhibit network structures (distributed, decentralized organization), they spread like viruses (contagious ideas that replicate), they are reproducing and reproducible (each part contains the potential of the whole), and they operate as fractal networks (patterns repeat at every scale).

The starfish and spider metaphor (developed in The Starfish and the Spirit) illustrates the difference between institutional and movemental organization. A spider has a head (central control) and legs (dependent parts)—cut off the head and the spider dies. A starfish has a distributed nervous system—cut it in half and you get two starfish. Movements operate like starfish: they are decentralized, distributed, and can reproduce from any part.

Movement dynamics involve both macro reproduction (church planting, multiplication of communities) and micro reproduction (every person mobilized for mission in their sphere of influence). This dual reproduction creates what I call "movementum"—the unstoppable momentum that builds when consistent effort is applied over time, like a flywheel that gains speed with each rotation.

Movements require a different kind of leadership than institutions. Instead of hierarchical control, movement leadership involves activation, empowerment, and release. Leaders in movements don't direct from the top but catalyze from within, releasing the latent potential already present in the people. This is servant leadership modeled after Jesus, who came not to be served but to serve.

The church's historical pattern has been movement → institution → movement. Movements begin with energy and purpose, but over time they institutionalize to sustain themselves. Institutions provide stability but often lose the dynamism that created them. The challenge is to maintain movemental energy even as we create necessary structures—to be organized but not institutionalized.

On the Verge explores how large churches can transition toward missional movements, combining the resources and reach of megachurches with the dynamism and reproduction capacity of movements. This requires paradigm shifts, cultural changes, and the embedding of mDNA throughout the organization.

Movement thinking requires a shift from addition to multiplication, from control to release, from programs to principles, from events to environments. It demands that we plant movements rather than churches, plant the gospel rather than ecclesial forms, and trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of multiplication rather than trying to engineer it through human effort alone.

### 7. Metanoia: The Journey of Transformation

**Publication Mapping:**
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Entire book dedicated to this theme
- **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Chapter 5, "Thro' Narrow Chinks in the Cavern"
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout as part of paradigm shift
- **5Q** (2017): Chapter 10, "To Get From Here to There"
- **The Faith of Leap** (2012, with Michael Frost): Related themes of risk and change

**Full Definition:**

Metanoia is the Greek word usually translated as "repentance" in English, but it carries far richer meaning than our reduced understanding of that term. Metanoia means a radical change of mind, an expanded reframing of reality, a paradigm shift that transforms how we see and understand everything. It involves breakthrough moments that transform perception, enabling us to see the world through fresh eyes and experience ongoing conversion.

Metanoia is essential for both personal discipleship and organizational transformation. Any advance in knowledge of God requires it. Any meaningful change in the church demands it. Metanoia is not a one-time event but an ongoing journey, a process that must be repeated as new challenges arise and as we grow in understanding.

The Metanoia Journey follows a U-shaped curve, involving both unlearning (the downcurve) and relearning (the upcurve). The downcurve consists of four stages: **Unravel** (facing wicked problems and adaptive challenges), **Uncover** (sensing system flaws with "soft eyes"), **Unlock** (exploring new frontiers and possibilities), and **Understand** (gaining clarity on alternatives). The upcurve involves three stages: **Paradigm** (articulating a new organizational mind), **Platform** (building culture and structures), and **Practices** (developing observable, repeatable behaviors).

This journey follows the pattern of the hero's journey identified by Joseph Campbell—the quest, ordeal, and return that characterizes transformative experiences. Jesus' own life followed this pattern: incarnation (descent), ministry and passion (ordeal), resurrection and ascension (ascent). Metanoia enables us to participate in this pattern, bringing us in sync with the mind of Christ.

Wholehearted metanoia requires the integration of mind, soul, and will. The biblical understanding of "heart" encompasses all three dimensions: **mind-power** (paradigm shift, new ways of thinking), **soul-power** (culture and values, what we love and celebrate), and **will-power** (strategic action, what we actually do). Lasting transformation requires engaging the whole person, both individually and collectively.

Christo-logic, developed in Metanoia, refers to thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ—seeing the world from inside the mind that created it. This involves seeing everything from God's perspective, thinking that transcends itself, holistic thinking that avoids reductionism, spiritual instinct, and discerning what God is doing to join with him.

Metanoia is not merely pragmatic change management but a deeply spiritual process that requires prayer, discernment, and reliance on the Holy Spirit. There are powers and principalities—spiritual forces—that resist transformation and seek to maintain the status quo. Leaders engaging in metanoia must recognize this is not just a human battle but a spiritual one.

The Paradigm-Platform-Practices framework provides a practical structure for organizational metanoia: **Paradigm** is the organizational mind (identity, story, defining ideas), **Platform** is the organizational soul (culture + structures), and **Practices** are the organizational will (observable, repeatable behaviors). All three must be aligned for transformation to take root and endure.

Metanoia is God's gift that enables transformation, opens new possibilities, and aligns individuals and organizations with God's purposes. It requires childlikeness—the curiosity and openness of children who haven't yet learned to close themselves off from wonder and surprise. Without metanoia, we cannot see clearly, cannot adapt, cannot grow. With metanoia, we can participate in God's ongoing work of making all things new.

### 8. Liminality and Communitas: The Edge of Adventure

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas"
- **The Faith of Leap** (2012, with Michael Frost): Chapters 1-2, "The Spirit's Edge" and "Jesus Is My Disequilibrium"
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 6, "The Metanoia Journey"
- **Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Related themes throughout

**Full Definition:**

Liminality and communitas represent the dynamic relationship between threshold experiences and the deep community that forms through shared adventure. These concepts, drawn from the anthropological work of Victor Turner, describe essential dynamics in missional movements that are often absent from safe, comfortable, institutional forms of church.

**Liminality** refers to threshold experiences—those times when people find themselves in transition between one state and another, outside normal structures and routines. The term comes from the Latin *limen*, meaning threshold. In liminal spaces, the old has not yet fully passed away and the new has not yet fully arrived. There is disorientation, risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough.

Liminality occurs when people feel at risk, face a challenge, or are deliberately on an adventure. It is the "edge of chaos" where innovation happens, where growth occurs, where transformation becomes possible. Liminality is essential for authentic discipleship because it strips away false securities and forces reliance on God and one another. Without liminality, we become comfortable, complacent, and eventually sterile.

**Communitas** is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences. It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

The distinction between community and communitas is crucial. Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?" Community is maintained through programs and activities. Communitas is maintained through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself.

The early church experienced communitas through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. Contemporary churches often lose this because they prioritize safety, comfort, and stability. Middle-class culture, with its focus on security, consumption, and risk-aversion, functions as an "anti-missional virus" that gradually erodes the liminal edge and replaces communitas with consumeristic community.

The Faith of Leap explores how adventure, risk, and courage are essential to authentic Christian discipleship. Christianity is an adventure of the spirit or it is not Christianity. God is a God of adventure, and therefore the church must be a place of great adventure and risk. When we remove adventure from the Christian life, we domesticate it, making it safe, predictable, and ultimately powerless.

Embedding liminality and communitas into church life requires intentional choices: engaging at the edges of society, taking risks for the sake of mission, embracing uncertainty rather than trying to control everything, prioritizing purpose over comfort, and creating environments where people can experience shared challenge and adventure.

Liminality and communitas are not optional extras for the adventurous few but essential elements of mDNA that enable movements to form and thrive. Without them, community becomes consumeristic, mission becomes maintenance, and the church loses its transformative edge.

### 9. Organic Systems: How Movements Organize

**Publication Mapping:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 9, "Organic Systems"
- **The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Throughout, especially distributed leadership
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout
- **The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim): Chapter 11, "Apostolic Architecture"

**Full Definition:**

Organic systems represent how movements organize themselves in ways that are consistent with living organisms rather than machines. The distinction is crucial: machines are designed, controlled, and maintained from outside. Organisms grow, adapt, and reproduce from within, following built-in patterns and principles.

The church has been heavily influenced by the "organization-as-machine" metaphor, leading to hierarchical control, programmatic thinking, and institutional maintenance. But the Bible uses organic metaphors to describe the church: body, vine, branches, seeds, trees, living temple. These are not decorative images but actual descriptors of how the church is designed to function.

Organic systems have several key characteristics: they are **self-organizing** (patterns emerge from within rather than being imposed from without), **adaptive** (able to respond to changing conditions), **reproducible** (able to replicate their DNA), **fractal** (patterns repeat at every scale), and **networked** (connected in distributed rather than centralized ways).

Living systems theory provides insights into how movements can scale while maintaining core DNA. Movements use **simple rules** (core principles that guide behavior), **common language** (shared vocabulary that carries meaning), **reproducible practices** (patterns that can be passed on), and **distributed leadership** (intelligence throughout the system rather than concentrated at the top).

The starfish and spider metaphor illustrates this: starfish (movements) have distributed intelligence and can reproduce from any part. Spiders (institutions) have centralized control and die if the head is removed. Movements thrive through decentralization, while institutions maintain control through centralization.

Organic systems enable movements to get to scale while maintaining coherence. They pass on DNA through relationships, stories, and practices rather than through policies and procedures. They adapt to local contexts while maintaining core identity. They grow through multiplication rather than addition, creating exponential rather than linear expansion.

The challenge is maintaining organic principles even as movements grow and create necessary structures. There is always tension between organization (necessary for sustainability) and institutionalization (death to movemental energy). Organic systems find ways to be organized but not institutionalized, structured but not rigid, guided but not controlled.

Apostolic Architecture (The Permanent Revolution) explores the relationship between modalities (local churches) and sodalities (task-oriented mission structures). Both are needed: modalities provide local presence and community, while sodalities provide specialized mission capacity. The key is maintaining mutuality and interdependence rather than allowing one to dominate the other.

Organic systems trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of organization rather than trying to engineer it through human systems alone. They recognize that the church is a living organism, not a machine to be fixed or a program to be run. When we align with organic principles, we discover that movements can grow, adapt, and reproduce in ways that human planning could never achieve.

### 10. Reframation: Re-enchanting Our Vision

**Publication Mapping:**
- **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Entire book dedicated to this theme
- **5Q** (2017): Preface, "In Praise of Soft Eyes"
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Related themes of perception and paradigm shift

**Full Definition:**

Reframation represents the urgent need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The term plays on "Reformation," suggesting that what we need is not merely reform but reframing—a fundamental shift in how we see and understand reality. This theme addresses the "crisis of interpretation" where Christians struggle to recognize and respond to the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence.

The problem is reductionism—the way we have reduced the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God into narrow, propositional, rationalistic formulas. We have demythologized the biblical narrative (removing its mythic power), demystified our faith (eliminating wonder and mystery), and depoeticized our language (reducing poetic speech to rational code). The result is a gospel that has lost its transformative power.

Reframation involves three key movements: **remystifying** (recovering wonder and radical amazement), **repoeticizing** (using language that captures imagination and speaks to the heart), and **remythologizing** (telling the full story of God with all its power and beauty). These movements help us "steal past the watchful dragons" that guard human hearts, allowing truth to penetrate defenses that rational arguments cannot breach.

The book explores how the gospel has been reduced to one dimension focused solely on guilt and forgiveness (the Western frame), leaving other human needs unaddressed. The "Great Reframation" involves recovering a three-dimensional gospel that addresses guilt (Western frame), shame (Eastern frame), and fear (Southern frame), recognizing that all three dimensions are now present in every Western context.

"Soft eyes" (introduced in 5Q's preface) refers to the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms—to see the whole picture rather than just analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see what is really there, to recognize the "shards of heaven's kaleidoscope" (the image of God) in every human soul, and to find what God is already doing in culture.

Reframation involves becoming "detectives of divinity," learning to read culture and people to discover their ultimate longings. This requires understanding universal human desires: longing for justice, thirst for spirituality, hunger for relationship, delight in beauty, and the need for significance and meaning. When we understand these longings, we can connect them to the gospel in ways that resonate deeply.

The practice of "romancing the city" (Reframation, Chapter 10) involves developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This is courtship rather than speed dating—patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work. It requires the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy.

Reframation calls for living "in/credible" lives that make others want to say "I'll have what they're having." This involves becoming "theological persons" whose lives bespeak theology, living "questionable lives" that arouse curiosity and invite questions, and participating in "tikkun olam"—repairing the world—as a way to join Jesus' mission of restoration.

The Great Reframation is not about changing the gospel but about recovering its fullness, removing the frames that have narrowed our vision, and seeing God, people, and mission through re-enchanted eyes. It requires humility (recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is"), childlikeness (approaching with wonder rather than cynicism), and the willingness to have our minds blown by the ever-greater God.

## Part Two: Supporting Themes and Applications

### 11. Paradigm-Platform-Practices: The Architecture of Change

**Publication Mapping:**
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Throughout, especially Chapters 2-3, 5-6
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapters 7-9, "Paradigm," "Platformed," "Practices"

**Full Definition:**

The Paradigm-Platform-Practices framework provides a three-level architecture for understanding and facilitating organizational transformation. It recognizes that change must happen at multiple levels simultaneously—in how we think (paradigm), how we feel and organize (platform), and how we act (practices).

**Paradigm** is the organizational mind—the identity, story, and defining ideas that shape how an organization understands itself and its purpose. Paradigms consist of mental maps (meta-ideas, beliefs, competencies) and organizational DNA (genetics that replicate throughout the system). Paradigm shift requires leadership unity, apostolic imagination, perseverance, telling alternate stories, letting things die, and seeing reality clearly.

**Platform** is the organizational soul—the culture and structures that shape collective behavior. Culture components include theological distinctives, core values, shared vocabulary, heroes, celebration of behavior, and branding. Movemental structures include relational structures (how people connect), resource structures (how resources flow), and measurement structures (what gets measured and rewarded). Platforms architect organizational behavior through the path of least resistance.

**Practices** are the organizational will—the observable, repeatable behaviors that embody values and create culture. Practices move from core values to core behaviors, develop movemental rhythms and algorithms, and create tools (physical, training, communication) that fractalize DNA throughout the organization. Practices make transformation tangible and embodied, creating habits and muscle memory that enable ongoing learning and refinement.

The framework recognizes that transformation requires alignment across all three levels. You cannot change practices without changing culture (platform), and you cannot change culture without changing thinking (paradigm). Conversely, paradigm shift without platform and practice changes will remain theoretical and unembodied.

In On the Verge, this framework is presented as Imagine (paradigm), Shift (platform/ethos), and Innovate (practices). The process recognizes that lasting change requires engaging mind, soul, and will—the whole person and the whole organization.

### 12. The Hero's Journey: The Archetypal Pattern

**Publication Mapping:**
- **5Q** (2017): Chapter 5, "The Hero's Journey—The Movement That Jesus Started"
- **The Faith of Leap** (2012, with Michael Frost): Chapter 4, "The Hero's Journey"
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 6, integrated into the Metanoia Journey

**Full Definition:**

The hero's journey, identified by Joseph Campbell, represents the universal archetypal pattern found in transformative stories across cultures: the quest, the ordeal, and the return. This pattern is not merely a narrative structure but describes the actual shape of transformative experiences—both individual and organizational.

Jesus' own life follows this pattern perfectly: incarnation (the call and descent), ministry and passion (the ordeal), resurrection and ascension (the return with new power). The church is called to participate in this same pattern, which is why movements and discipleship naturally follow the hero's journey shape.

In 5Q, the hero's journey connects to the ascension gifting of APEST—Jesus redeems and reconstitutes the fivefold archetypes through recapitulation (anakephalaiosis), giving them as victory gifts to his church in his triumphal parade. The hero's journey reveals how Jesus is the true hero who fulfills all archetypal myths.

The Metanoia Journey explicitly follows this U-shaped pattern: the downcurve (unravel, uncover, unlock, understand) represents the descent and ordeal, while the upcurve (paradigm, platform, practices) represents the return with new understanding and capacity.

Understanding the hero's journey helps leaders recognize that transformation requires going through the valley, not around it. There is no shortcut to maturity—we must face the ordeal, embrace the liminality, and emerge on the other side with new capacity. This pattern gives hope in difficult seasons, recognizing that the descent is part of the journey, not a deviation from it.

### 13. Disciplism: Reframing Evangelism

**Publication Mapping:**
- **Disciplism** (2014): Entire book

**Full Definition:**

Disciplism addresses the alarming loss of discipleship as a central practice in the contemporary church and proposes that evangelism must be reframed within the context of discipleship rather than the reverse. The term itself suggests that discipleship should be the "ism" that shapes our approach—not evangelism as a separate activity, but disciplism as the comprehensive framework.

The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has created a Christianity that makes converts but not disciples.

Disciplism critiques how contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach. Jesus' ministry and early church practice demonstrate that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

The key insight is "begin with the end in mind"—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start. Evangelism, worship, community, and mission all serve the larger purpose of making disciples who can make disciples.

### 14. Soft Eyes: The Art of Perceiving Patterns

**Publication Mapping:**
- **5Q** (2017): Preface, "In Praise of Soft Eyes"
- **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Related themes of perception throughout

**Full Definition:**

"Soft eyes" is a concept borrowed from The Wire (Detective Bunk) that refers to the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms rather than just focusing on analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see the whole picture, to recognize underlying structures and connections that hard, analytical eyes miss.

In 5Q, soft eyes are essential for perceiving the APEST framework—not just as five separate functions but as an integrated system, a primordial template that seeks expression throughout history. Soft eyes help us see beyond surface appearances to the deeper reality of how God has designed the church.

Soft eyes require humility—recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is." They require childlikeness—approaching with wonder and curiosity rather than cynicism and certainty. They require patience—allowing patterns to emerge rather than forcing categories.

The contrast is between analytic (reductionist) thinking and synthetic (symphonic) thinking. The church needs the latter to see the whole picture, to understand how all the pieces fit together, and to recognize the overarching framework that reveals ministry and church as never before.

### 15. VUCA and Adaptive Challenge

**Publication Mapping:**
- **Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Throughout, especially Chapter 1
- **On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Related themes of change and complexity

**Full Definition:**

VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) describes the environment in which the contemporary church finds itself. This context requires adaptive rather than technical solutions—problems that cannot be solved by applying existing expertise but require new learning, experimentation, and paradigm shifts.

Adaptive challenges are different from technical problems. Technical problems can be solved by experts applying known solutions. Adaptive challenges require the organization itself to change, to learn new ways of operating, to develop new capacities. Most of the church's current challenges are adaptive, yet we continue trying to solve them with technical solutions.

Metanoia is the essential skill for navigating VUCA contexts. Without the ability to unlearn and relearn, to shift paradigms and adapt, organizations will struggle to survive in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environments. This is why metanoia is not optional but essential for organizational health and mission effectiveness.

## Conclusion: The Integrated Whole

These themes do not exist in isolation. They form an integrated system, much like the elements of mDNA themselves. Jesus is Lord provides the foundation. Apostolic Genius emerges when mDNA elements work together. APEST/5Q creates the ministry environment. Discipleship forms the people. Missional-Incarnational Impulse sends them out. Movement Dynamics enable reproduction. Metanoia facilitates transformation. Liminality and Communitas create the community. Organic Systems provide the structure. Reframation enables us to see clearly.

The themes build upon one another, inform one another, and require one another. You cannot have authentic movement without all of them. You cannot understand one fully without understanding how it relates to the others. This is why the work must be engaged as a whole, not as isolated concepts to be extracted and applied piecemeal.

The map is not the territory. This index points to the themes, but the themes themselves must be encountered in their full context within the books where they are developed. Use this as your guide, but always return to the source texts. The journey is just beginning.
