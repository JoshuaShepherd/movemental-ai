> **Comprehensive plan for reorganizing all content research around the 11 Portals**

**Status**: Phase 4 Complete (Planning Phase)  
**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Executive plan for portal-based content reorganization

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan for reorganizing all content research in `_docs/content-research/core-content/` around the 11 editorial portals as core thematic entry points. The reorganization will transform the current topic-based organization into a portal-based structure, ensuring all content is aligned with portal themes, terminology, and source materials.

### Scope

- **135+ content files** to be reorganized
- **11 portals** requiring complete content coverage
- **13+ books** providing source material
- **8 content types** per portal (concept-definitions, framework-explanations, comprehensive-qa, faq-answers, thematic-deep-dives, practical-guides, case-studies, connection-maps)
- **3 organizational categories**: Portal-specific, Cross-portal, Shared

### Key Objectives

1. **Organize by portal themes** (not generic categories)
2. **Align with source books** (thoroughly reviewed and updated)
3. **Ensure comprehensive coverage** (all themes fully addressed)
4. **Standardize terminology** (using portal terminology throughout)
5. **Ensure answerability** (derived from and traceable to books)

### Implementation Phases

- **Phases 1-4**: Planning and Analysis (✅ Complete)
- **Phase 5**: Terminology Standardization (Next)
- **Phase 6**: Content Revision & Alignment
- **Phase 7**: New Content Creation from Books
- **Phase 8**: Cross-Portal Integration
- **Phase 9**: Quality & Completeness Review
- **Phase 10**: Final Organization & Structure

```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Create new directory structure** (before moving files)
2. **Move files portal-by-portal** (systematic approach)
3. **Update file references** (as files are moved)
4. **Rename files** (for clarity and consistency)
5. **Verify structure** (after each portal is completed)

---

## Terminology Standardization

### Portal-Specific Terminology

Each portal has preferred terminology (documented in PORTAL_THEME_MAPPING.md). All content must use portal-specific terminology consistently.

### Standardization Process

1. **Create terminology reference** (PORTAL_TERMINOLOGY.md) - Phase 5
2. **Review all content files** (identify terminology inconsistencies)
3. **Map alternative terms** (to portal terminology)
4. **Update terminology** (in all files)
5. **Verify consistency** (across all portals)

### Key Terminology Updates Needed

- Generic terms → Portal-specific terms
- Alternative terms → Portal terminology
- Inconsistent usage → Standardized usage
- Cross-portal references → Portal-specific terminology

---

## Content Creation Priorities

### High Priority (Major Gaps)

1. **Portal 7 (APEST Culture)**: 10+ new files needed
2. **Portal 10 (Reframation)**: 8+ new files needed
