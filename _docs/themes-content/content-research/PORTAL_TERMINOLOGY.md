### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Five gifts" → **"APEST functions"** or **"Fivefold Intelligence"**
- "Ministry gifts" → **"Fivefold intelligence"** or **"APEST functions"**
- "Leadership roles" → **"APEST functions"** (when referring to fivefold ministry)
- "The fivefold" → **"APEST"** or **"5Q"**
- "Spiritual gifts" → Context: Use **"APEST functions"** when referring to fivefold ministry (APEST complements spiritual gifts)
- "Giftings" → **"APEST functions"** or **"Fivefold Intelligence"**

### Definitions

**APEST**: The fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11, where Christ gives gifts to his church: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds (Pastors), and Teachers. In 5Q, this framework is expanded to reveal APEST not merely as ministry functions but as five forms of intelligence (5Q) that are both the primordial template for church life and universal archetypes present throughout human culture.

**5Q (Fivefold Intelligence)**: The expanded understanding of APEST as five forms of organizational intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.

**Fivefold marks of the church**: The five marks that indicate a true church: apostolic (missional), prophetic (holy and just), evangelistic (proclaiming good news), shepherding (reconciled community), and teaching (wisdom and truth). These marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"APEST"** when referring to the framework or the five functions together
- Use **"5Q"** when emphasizing the intelligence aspect or the expanded understanding
- Use **"Fivefold Ministry"** when referring to the biblical framework (Ephesians 4:11)
- Use **"Fivefold Intelligence"** when emphasizing the organizational intelligence aspect
- Use individual function names (**Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher**) when referring to specific functions
- Use abbreviations (**AQ, PQ, EQ, SQ, TQ**) when referring to the intelligence forms in technical contexts

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Church growth" → **"Movement multiplication"** or **"Movement reproduction"**
- "Expansion" → **"Movement reproduction"** or **"Movement multiplication"**
- "Organization" → **"Movement"** (when describing movemental form)
- "Institutional" → **"Movemental"** (when contrasting with institutional forms)
- "Growth" → **"Multiplication"** or **"Reproduction"** (when referring to movemental growth)

### Definitions

**Movement Intelligence (MQ)**: The characteristics and quality that distinguish movements from institutions. Movement Quality represents the capacity for exponential multiplication through simple, reproducible patterns, distinguishing movemental forms from institutional forms.

**Movemental**: Having the characteristics of a movement—decentralized, distributed, reproducible, adaptive, networked, and capable of exponential multiplication.

**Movementum**: The unstoppable momentum that builds when consistent effort is applied over time, like a flywheel that gains speed with each rotation. This momentum enables exponential rather than linear growth.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Movement Intelligence"** or **"Movement Quality (MQ)"** when referring to the concept
- Use **"Movemental"** as the adjective form (not "movement-like" or "movement-based")
- Use **"Movement multiplication"** or **"Movement reproduction"** instead of "church growth" or "expansion"

## Portal 3: The Forgotten Ways (`forgotten-ways`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **The Forgotten Ways** - The patterns and practices of early Christian movements
- **Apostolic Genius** - The mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that exists within the people of God and can be activated to create transformative movements
- **Movement DNA (mDNA)** - The six-element genetic code for reproducing and sustaining genuine missional movements
- **Rediscovery** / **Recovery** - The process of recovering Apostolic Genius (not creating something new)

- **Recovery vs. creation** - Recovering what's latent vs. creating something new
- **Latent potential** - The potential for movement already present in the church
- **The future in the womb of the present** - The potential already exists

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Ancient practices" → **"Forgotten ways"** or **"Early church patterns"**
- "Early church methods" → **"Apostolic patterns"** or **"Forgotten ways"**
- "Church DNA" → **"Movement DNA (mDNA)"**
- "Apostolic movement" → **"Apostolic Genius"** (when referring to the system)

### Definitions

**Apostolic Genius**: That mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy—those vibrant spiritual instincts—that exist within the people of God and can be activated to create transformative movements. The term was coined because no existing word adequately captured this phenomenon. It describes the system that emerges from the dynamic interrelationship of all the key elements working together, creating something greater than the sum of its parts.

**Movement DNA (mDNA)**: The six-element genetic code for reproducing and sustaining genuine missional movements. Like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every living cell (present in every genuine expression of church), contains all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism, is self-replicating, carries vital information for healthy reproduction, and can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated.

**The Forgotten Ways**: The patterns and practices of early Christian movements that enabled exponential multiplication. These ways have been forgotten by the modern church but can be recovered and reactivated.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Apostolic Genius"** when referring to the system or the phenomenon
- Use **"Movement DNA (mDNA)"** when referring to the six-element framework
- Use **"The Forgotten Ways"** when referring to the historical patterns or the book
- Use **"Recovery"** or **"Rediscovery"** (not "creation" or "invention") when describing the process
- Always use **"mDNA"** (not "church DNA" or other variations)

## Portal 4: Jesus is Lord (mDNA) (`jesus-is-lord-mdna`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Jesus is Lord** - The central confession and foundation of mDNA
- **Movement DNA (mDNA)** - The six-element genetic code (see Portal 3 for full definition)
- **The six elements of mDNA** - The complete framework
- **Central confession** - "Jesus is Lord" as the foundational confession
- **Missional DNA** - Alternative term for mDNA (less preferred)
- **Systemic** / **Systemic nature** - How all six elements work together
- **Element integration** - How elements work together as a system

**Supporting Terms:**
- **Christology determines missiology determines ecclesiology** - The foundational principle
- **The Shema connection** - Connection to "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"
- **Monotheistic confession** - The theological foundation
- **Political and revolutionary nature** - The implications of "Jesus is Lord"
- **Simple yet profound** - The nature of the confession
- **Essence vs. reductionism** - The core truth vs. oversimplification
- **All six elements working together** - The systemic requirement
- **Each necessary but not sufficient** - The systemic nature

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "The six practices" → **"The six elements of mDNA"**
- "Church DNA" → **"Movement DNA (mDNA)"**
- "The six components" → **"The six elements of mDNA"**

### Definitions

**Jesus is Lord**: The absolute center from which all other themes radiate. This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that gives meaning and coherence to everything else. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems, but this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord.

**Movement DNA (mDNA)**: The six-element genetic code for reproducing and sustaining genuine missional movements. The six elements are: 1) Jesus is Lord (the central confession), 2) Disciple-Making (multiplication through formation), 3) Missional-Incarnational Impulse (going out and going deep), 4) APEST Culture (the fivefold ministry environment), 5) Organic Systems (movemental structures), 6) Communitas (liminal community).

### Usage Guidelines

- Always use **"Jesus is Lord"** (not "Jesus as Lord" or other variations) when referring to the central confession
- Use **"Movement DNA (mDNA)"** consistently (not "church DNA" or other variations)
- Use **"The six elements of mDNA"** (not "the six practices" or "the six components")
- Emphasize **"Jesus is Lord"** as the foundation (not just one element among six)

## Portal 5: Discipleship & Disciple-Making (`discipleship-disciple-making`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Discipleship** / **Disciple-Making** - The essential practice of forming people into the image of Christ
- **Disciplism** - The "ism" of discipleship (discipleship as the comprehensive framework)
- **Formation** - The process of forming people into the image of Christ
- **Apprenticeship** - Learning through relationship and modeling
- **Jesus-shaped discipleship** - Discipleship centered on Christ's person and example
- **Reproduction** - Disciples making disciples
- **Intentional formation** - Deliberate, purposeful disciple-making

**Supporting Terms:**
- **Discipleship as evangelism's context** - The correct order (not the reverse)
- **Shema spirituality** - Loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength
- **The inseparability of mission and discipleship** - You cannot have one without the other
- **Begin with the end in mind** - If the end goal is making disciples, everything must be oriented toward that goal
- **The cross from the beginning** - The cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning
- **Discipleship before conversion** - Discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts
- **Untamed discipleship** - Wild, radical, dangerous discipleship matching the untamed nature of the Messiah

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Spiritual formation" → **"Discipleship"** (in missional context) or **"Formation"**
- "Training" → **"Formation"** or **"Apprenticeship"**
- "Evangelism" → Context: **"Evangelism within discipleship"** (not replacing, but reframing)
- "Making converts" → **"Making disciples"** (discipleship includes conversion but goes beyond)

### Definitions

**Discipleship**: The essential practice of forming people into the image of Christ. Discipleship is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move; it is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making.

**Disciplism**: The comprehensive framework that reframes evangelism within the context of discipleship rather than the reverse. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making.

**Jesus-shaped discipleship**: Discipleship that involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Discipleship"** or **"Disciple-Making"** as the primary term
- Use **"Disciplism"** when referring to the framework that reframes evangelism within discipleship
- Use **"Formation"** when emphasizing the process of being formed
- Use **"Apprenticeship"** when emphasizing learning through relationship and modeling
- Always frame **"Evangelism"** as happening **"within discipleship"** (not the reverse)

### Source References

- **The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 5, "Disciple Making"

## Portal 6: Missional-Incarnational Impulse (`missional-incarnational-impulse`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - The twin movements of going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational)
- **Missional** (adjective) - Having the character of being sent
- **Incarnational** (adjective) - Having the character of becoming native to context
- **Sentness** - The sending nature of the church
- **Missio Dei** - The sending of God (God's mission)
- **Contextualization** - Becoming native to a specific context
- **Going out, going deep** - The twin movements

**The Six P's of Incarnational Mission:**
- **Presence** - Full identification with culture
- **Proximity** - Geographic and relational closeness
- **Powerlessness** - Humility and vulnerability
- **Prevenience** - Recognizing God's work already present
- **Passion** - Embracing redemptive suffering
- **Proclamation** - Sharing the good news

**Four Movements Framework:**
- **Move Out** - Into missional engagement
- **Move In** - Burrowing into culture through incarnation
- **Move Alongside** - Engaging in relationships and community
- **Move From** - Challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture

**Supporting Terms:**
- **Romancing the city** - Developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach

- **Attractional vs. missional** - Coming to us vs. going to them
- **Evangelistic-attractional pattern** - The pattern that blocks missional engagement
- **The sneeze that cannot be suppressed** - The outward movement of mission

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Mission work" → **"Missional engagement"** or **"Missional impulse"**
- "Outreach" → **"Missional impulse"** or **"Missional engagement"**
- "Contextual ministry" → **"Incarnational mission"**
- "Cultural adaptation" → **"Contextualization"** or **"Incarnational mission"**

### Definitions

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

**Missional**: The outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people.

**Incarnational**: The deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Missional-Incarnational Impulse"** as the complete term (not just "missional" or "incarnational" alone)
- Use **"Missional"** as the adjective form (not "missional church" when referring to the impulse)
- Use **"Incarnational"** as the adjective form (not "incarnational ministry" when referring to the impulse)
- Use **"Sentness"** when emphasizing the sending nature
- Use **"Missio Dei"** when emphasizing God's initiative
- Use **"The six P's"** when referring to the incarnational practices
- Use **"Four movements"** when referring to the Fast Forward to Mission framework

- "Healthy organization" → **"APEST Culture"** (when referring to fivefold activation)
- "Organizational culture" → **"APEST Culture"** (when referring to fivefold environment)

### Definitions

**APEST Culture**: An organizational culture where all five APEST functions are activated. This creates an apostolic environment and organizational health that enables movement multiplication. APEST Culture is measured by the fivefold marks: apostolic (missional), prophetic (holy and just), evangelistic (proclaiming good news), shepherding (reconciled community), and teaching (wisdom and truth).

**Apostolic Environment**: An organizational environment that activates the apostolic function, enabling extension, multiplication, and movemental capacity. This environment supports all five functions working together.

**Fivefold Activation**: The process of activating all five APEST functions in an organization, moving beyond the ST-only model to include APE functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist).

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"APEST Culture"** when referring to organizational culture with fivefold activation
- Use **"Apostolic Environment"** when emphasizing the environment that enables apostolic function
- Use **"Fivefold Activation"** when describing the process
- Use **"Fivefold marks"** when referring to organizational metrics

## Portal 8: Organic Systems (`organic-systems`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Organic Systems** - Simple, reproducible patterns that enable movement multiplication
- **Organic** (adjective) - Having the characteristics of living organisms (self-organizing, adaptive, reproducible, fractal, networked)
- **Reproduction** / **Reproducible** - The ability to replicate DNA
- **Multiplication** - Exponential growth through reproduction
- **Simplicity** - Simple enough to reproduce

- **Adaptive** - Able to respond to changing conditions
- **Fractal** - Patterns repeat at every scale
- **Networked** - Connected in distributed rather than centralized ways

**Supporting Terms:**
- **Simple rules** - Core principles that guide behavior
- **Common language** - Shared vocabulary that carries meaning
- **Reproducible practices** - Patterns that can be passed on
- **Distributed leadership** - Intelligence throughout the system
- **Modalities and sodalities** - Local churches and task-oriented mission structures
- **Organized but not institutionalized** - Maintaining movemental energy while creating necessary structures
- **Living systems theory** - The theoretical foundation

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Church structure" → **"Organic systems"** (when describing movemental organization)
- "Organization" → **"Organic systems"** (when describing living forms)
- "System design" → **"Organic system design"** (when referring to movemental systems)

### Definitions

**Organic Systems**: Simple, reproducible patterns that enable movement multiplication. These systems organize themselves in ways consistent with living organisms rather than machines. The distinction is crucial: machines are designed, controlled, and maintained from outside. Organisms grow, adapt, and reproduce from within, following built-in patterns and principles.

**Organic**: Having the characteristics of living organisms—self-organizing (patterns emerge from within), adaptive (able to respond to changing conditions), reproducible (able to replicate their DNA), fractal (patterns repeat at every scale), and networked (connected in distributed rather than centralized ways).

**Starfish Organization**: A decentralized, distributed organization where intelligence is distributed throughout the system rather than concentrated at the top. Like a starfish, if cut in half, you get two starfish—the organization can reproduce from any part.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Organic Systems"** when referring to movemental organizational patterns
- Use **"Organic"** as the adjective form (not "organic-like" or "organic-based")
- Use **"Starfish organization"** when describing decentralized structures
- Use **"Reproduction"** or **"Multiplication"** (not "growth" or "expansion")
- Emphasize **"Simplicity"** as essential for reproduction

## Portal 9: Liminality & Communitas (`liminality-communitas`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Liminality** - Threshold experiences, times of transition between one state and another
- **Communitas** - Deep sense of comradeship and togetherness formed through shared liminal experiences
- **Liminal spaces** / **Liminal experiences** - Threshold experiences
- **Threshold** - The boundary between states
- **Crisis** - Situations that create liminality
- **Adventure** - Engaging in risk and challenge
- **Risk** - Taking chances for the sake of mission
- **Community** (distinguished from communitas) - Regular community vs. mission-forged community

- **The edge of chaos** - Where innovation and growth occur
- **Middle-class culture as anti-missional virus** - The forces that erode liminality
- **Shared adventure** - Adventure that creates communitas
- **Persecution and communitas** - How crisis creates deep community
- **The hero's journey** - The pattern that includes liminality
- **U-shaped journey** - The downcurve and upcurve pattern

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Community" → Context: Use **"communitas"** when describing mission-forged community
- "Challenge" → **"Liminality"** (when describing threshold experiences)
- "Fellowship" → **"Communitas"** (when describing mission-formed community)
- "Comfort zone" → **"Liminality"** (when describing moving beyond comfort)

### Definitions

**Liminality**: Threshold experiences—those times when people find themselves in transition between one state and another, outside normal structures and routines. In liminal spaces, the old has not yet fully passed away and the new has not yet fully arrived. There is disorientation, risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough.

**Communitas**: The deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences. It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

**Community vs. Communitas**: Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?"

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Liminality"** when referring to threshold experiences
- Use **"Communitas"** when referring to mission-forged community (not regular "community")
- Use **"Community"** when referring to regular community (distinguish from communitas)
- Use **"The edge of chaos"** when describing where innovation happens
- Use **"Shared mission"** or **"Shared adventure"** when describing what creates communitas

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Formation" → Context: **"Reframation"** when describing reframed formation
- "Cultural engagement" → **"Romancing the city"** (in specific context)
- "Cultural adaptation" → **"Romancing the city"** or **"Interpathy"**
- "Evangelism" → Context: **"Reframation"** when describing reframed approach

### Definitions

**Reframation**: The urgent need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The term plays on "Reformation," suggesting that what we need is not merely reform but reframing—a fundamental shift in how we see and understand reality. This addresses the "crisis of interpretation" where Christians struggle to recognize and respond to the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence.

**Soft Eyes**: The ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms rather than just focusing on analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see the whole picture, to recognize underlying structures and connections that hard, analytical eyes miss. This requires humility (recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is"), childlikeness (approaching with wonder rather than cynicism), and patience (allowing patterns to emerge).

**Romancing the City**: Developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This is courtship rather than speed dating—patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work. It requires the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Reframation"** when referring to the comprehensive reframing process
- Use **"Soft eyes"** when referring to pattern perception
- Use **"Romancing the city"** when referring to deep cultural engagement
- Use **"Interpathy"** when referring to deep cross-cultural empathy
- Use **"The Great Reframation"** when referring to the comprehensive reframing needed
- Use **"Three movements"** (remystifying, repoeticizing, remythologizing) when describing the reframation process

## Portal 11: Metanoia (`metanoia`)

### Preferred Terminology

**Core Terms:**
- **Metanoia** - Radical change of mind, expanded reframing of reality, paradigm shift
- **Transformation** - The process of change
- **Paradigm Shift** - Fundamental change in how we see and understand
- **Christo-logic** - Thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ
- **Wholehearted Metanoia** - Integration of mind, soul, and will
- **The Metanoia Journey** - The U-shaped transformation process
- **U-shaped curve** - The downcurve (unlearning) and upcurve (relearning)
- **Ongoing conversion** - Metanoia as an ongoing journey

**The Metanoia Journey Stages:**
- **Downcurve**: Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand
- **Upcurve**: Paradigm, Platform, Practices

**Paradigm-Platform-Practices Framework:**
- **Paradigm** - The organizational mind (identity, story, defining ideas)
- **Platform** - The organizational soul (culture + structures)
- **Practices** - The organizational will (observable, repeatable behaviors)

**Wholehearted Metanoia:**
- **Mind-power** - Paradigm shift, new ways of thinking
- **Soul-power** - Culture and values, what we love and celebrate
- **Will-power** - Strategic action, what we actually do

**Supporting Terms:**
- **VUCA** - Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous (the environment requiring metanoia)
- **Adaptive challenge** - Problems requiring new learning and paradigm shifts
- **Breakthrough moments** - Moments that transform perception
- **Childlikeness** - The curiosity and openness needed for metanoia
- **Spiritual forces and resistance** - The powers that resist transformation

### Alternative Terms to Map

**❌ Avoid / Map to Portal Terminology:**
- "Repentance" → **"Metanoia"** (when referring to paradigm shift)
- "Change management" → **"Metanoia"** (when referring to transformation)
- "Mindset change" → **"Paradigm shift"** or **"Metanoia"**
- "Organizational change" → **"Metanoia"** (when referring to transformation)

### Definitions

**Metanoia**: The Greek word usually translated as "repentance" in English, but it carries far richer meaning than our reduced understanding of that term. Metanoia means a radical change of mind, an expanded reframing of reality, a paradigm shift that transforms how we see and understand everything. It involves breakthrough moments that transform perception, enabling us to see the world through fresh eyes and experience ongoing conversion.

**The Metanoia Journey**: The U-shaped transformation process involving both unlearning (the downcurve) and relearning (the upcurve). The downcurve consists of four stages: **Unravel** (facing wicked problems and adaptive challenges), **Uncover** (sensing system flaws with "soft eyes"), **Unlock** (exploring new frontiers and possibilities), and **Understand** (gaining clarity on alternatives). The upcurve involves three stages: **Paradigm** (articulating a new organizational mind), **Platform** (building culture and structures), and **Practices** (developing observable, repeatable behaviors).

**Paradigm-Platform-Practices**: The three-level architecture for understanding and facilitating organizational transformation. **Paradigm** is the organizational mind (identity, story, defining ideas). **Platform** is the organizational soul (culture + structures). **Practices** are the organizational will (observable, repeatable behaviors). All three must be aligned for transformation to take root and endure.

### Usage Guidelines

- Use **"Metanoia"** (not "repentance" when referring to paradigm shift)
- Use **"The Metanoia Journey"** when referring to the U-shaped process
- Use **"Paradigm-Platform-Practices"** as the complete framework name
- Use **"Wholehearted Metanoia"** when emphasizing integration of mind, soul, and will
- Use **"Christo-logic"** when referring to thinking formatted according to Christ
- Use **"VUCA"** when describing the environment requiring metanoia
