# Portal Theme Mapping

> **Comprehensive mapping of all 11 Portals to their themes, terminology, source materials, and content requirements**

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete  
**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Foundation document for portal-based content reorganization

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive mapping of all 11 editorial portals, serving as the foundation for reorganizing all content research around these portals as core thematic entry points. Each portal represents a foundational theme that runs throughout Alan Hirsch's body of work, and this mapping ensures all content is organized, framed, and aligned with portal-specific themes and terminology.
