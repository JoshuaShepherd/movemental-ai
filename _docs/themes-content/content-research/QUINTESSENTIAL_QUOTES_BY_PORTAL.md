## Portal 1: APEST & Fivefold Ministry (`apest-fivefold-ministry`)

### From 5Q: Reactivating the Original Intelligence and Capacity of the Body of Christ

**Chapter 1: Introduction**

> "The purpose of APEST is outlined in verses 12–16: 'to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.' This reveals the teleological (goal-oriented) nature of the fivefold ministry. APEST exists to bring the church to maturity and fullness—specifically, 'the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.'"

> "The language Paul uses in Ephesians 4:11 ('apostle,' 'prophet,' 'evangelist,' 'shepherd,' 'teacher') is drawn from broader Greco-Roman culture, indicating that these roles are not unique to Christianity, but are given special theological significance."

**Chapter 2: 5Q The Primordial Form**

> "APEST, viewed as five key archetypes latent in all creation, provides a robust framework for understanding and organizing human thought and endeavor. While more than five archetypes exist, the fivefold typology is particularly potent."

> "5Q (APEST): Fivefold intelligence—combining distinct types for heightened social and organizational capability. Each type—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching—brings a unique perspective, fostering synergistic intelligence in human society and the church."

## Portal 2: Movement Intelligence (MQ) (`movement-intelligence`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 3: Preparing for the Journey**

> "Apostolic Genius is an emergent organization; the system that arises out of the dynamic interrelationship of all the various key elements of mDNA. It is a living system that can adapt and evolve. Scientist, consultant, and living systems–thought leader Margaret Wheatley notes that as networks grow and transform into active, working communities of practice, local efforts connect with each other as networks, then strengthen as communities of practice, and finally emerge as a system of influence at a new level of scale. This system of influence possesses qualities and capacities that don't exist until the system emerges. They are properties of the system, not of the individual parts. The system that emerges always possesses greater power and influence than is possible through the mere accumulation of parts. It is the system that takes things to scale."

**Chapter 9: Organic Systems**

> "We now look a bit deeper into how exponentially expanding movements organize: How do movements manage to get to scale while maintaining their core ideas/DNA? How do they maintain the core ideas and values while encouraging innovation and adaptation?"

> "Movements, like life itself, are committed to exponential growth from the very beginning. This is the nature of the movement that Jesus started."

## Portal 3: The Forgotten Ways (`forgotten-ways`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 3: Preparing for the Journey**

> "Apostolic Genius is not something that we have to impose on the church, as if it were something alien to it. Rather, it is something that is already there, latent in the very DNA of the people of God. The seed of the future is in the womb of the present."

> "In coining this term, I wanted to pinpoint something that is very hard to define but is nonetheless very real—that underlying dynamic force that makes the church come alive in its dynamic movemental forms. There is no current word or phrase to define this phenomenon adequately, so I had to create one. 'Apostolic Genius' describes the built-in life force and guiding mechanism of the apostolic church."

**Introduction**

> "Apostolic Genius (and its composite elements of mDNA) holds a powerful mirror up to our own practices and conceptions of church and in doing so reveals the stark contrast between our current experience and that of the outstanding Jesus movements of history."

## Portal 4: Jesus is Lord (mDNA) (`jesus-is-lord-mdna`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 4: The Heart of It All: Jesus Is Lord**

> "When we say 'Jesus is Lord' or 'Jesus is Savior,' it is not just the simple affirmation that Jesus is our Master and we are his servants. This confession carries the full weight of the primal confession that 'Yahweh is Lord.' As such, this confession touches on the very nature of God, his relation to his world as King, and his covenantal relationship with his people."

> "The early Christians proclaimed 'Jesus is Lord' in the same way, and with exactly the same implications, that Israel proclaimed 'Yahweh is Lord.' The religious context hadn't changed all that much (it never really does). Polytheism was still the dominant religious worldview, though the names had changed from those of Canaanite ones (Baal, Ashteroth, etc.) to Greco-Roman ones (Zeus, Apollo, etc.)."

> "This is what I have called christocentric monotheism because it realigns our loyalties to God through Jesus. Jesus becomes the focal point in our relation to God, and it is to him that we must give our allegiance and obedience. The lordship of Jesus is the covenant claim of God over our lives in the same way that it is in the Old Testament."

> "'Jesus is Lord' is the foundational mDNA and a critical element of Apostolic Genius. The other elements of mDNA flow from this central confession. At the heart of the church's call and mission lies a challenge to respond to God with total allegiance."

## Portal 5: Discipleship & Disciple-Making (`discipleship-disciple-making`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 5: Disciple Making**

> "But even more significant, discipleship is the very task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry—the selection and development of that motley band of followers on whose shoulders the whole movement that has extended itself through the ages and into the twenty-first century would emerge from his death and resurrection."

> "It is interesting that at the most uncomplicated level, missional movements never appear to get beyond disciple making as a core practice. This is the practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact in and through movements."

> "For the follower of Jesus, discipleship must not be viewed as the first step beyond which we move to some other, more advanced destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way."

> "If the heart of discipleship is to become like Jesus, then it seems to me that the primary task of the church is to get many little versions of him infiltrating every nook and cranny of society, bringing the redemptive presence of Christ into the world."

---

## Portal 6: Missional-Incarnational Impulse (`missional-incarnational-impulse`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 6: Missional-Incarnational Impulse**

> "We have come to see that mission is not merely an activity of the church. Rather mission is the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. Mission defines the church, not the reverse. Mission is the purpose of God's action in human history."

> "The missional impulse is the outward movement of a community or individual to another. It is the outward thrust rooted in God's mission that compels the church to reach a lost world. The missional impulse is a sending rather than an attractional one."

> "The missional-incarnational impulse is, in effect, the practical outworking of the New Testament teaching of the incarnation of God in Jesus. It is thus rooted in the very nature of God himself."

> "Following the missional impulse, the church goes out; following the incarnational impulse, it goes deep. The combination is so vital to missional movements that I have come to believe it is intrinsic to the church in its apostolic form."

---

## Portal 7: APEST Culture (`apest-culture`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 8: APEST Culture**

> "I use the term 'APEST culture' deliberately because I want to emphasize that APEST is not just about individual callings and giftings, but also all the various social functions associated with each aspect of APEST, as well as the organizational structures and systems that support the ministry and mission of the church. In other words, APEST culture is a comprehensive approach to the ministry of the church."

> "I am convinced that APEST culture can initiate, generate, develop, and sustain movements."

> "The Western church is organizationally and culturally perfectly designed to achieve almost exclusively pastoral and educational outcomes. This is not surprising, given that we have only pastors and teachers in the first place—it is precisely what you would expect from a reduced system."

> "All five ministries are needed to engender, call forth, and sustain a full ministry culture. The ministries are interdependent; one cannot function properly without the others."

---

## Portal 8: Organic Systems (`organic-systems`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 9: Organic Systems**

> "We now look a bit deeper into how exponentially expanding movements organize: How do movements manage to get to scale while maintaining their core ideas/DNA? How do they maintain the core ideas and values while encouraging innovation and adaptation?"

> "In this chapter, we will probe how the church in its most remarkable form organizes itself as a living organism that is entirely consistent with how God has designed and structured life itself, rather than as a machine—that have become dominant and have damaged our capacity to be the church Jesus intended."

> "Essentially a living-systems approach requires seeing organizations as living, responsive, adaptive systems rather than as machines. As we have seen, viewing the movement that Jesus started through the lens of organic metaphors (body, vine, people of God, yeast) affirms and legitimizes the essentially living, responding, and adaptive nature of movements."

> "Apostolic movements are essentially networks and not centralized institutions."

---

## Portal 9: Liminality & Communitas (`liminality-communitas`)

### From The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church

**Chapter 7: Liminality and Communitas**

> "The related ideas of liminality and communitas describe the dynamics of the Christian community inspired to overcome their instincts to 'huddle and cuddle' and form themselves around a common mission that calls them to a dangerous journey to unknown places—a mission that calls the church out of its safety zones into a liminal space where its members will experience disorientation and marginalization but also find God and one another in new ways."

> "Communitas is therefore always linked with the experience of liminality. It involves adventure, risk, journey, and engagement—that really happens only among a group of people inspired by the vision of a better world and attempting to do something about it."

> "From the perspective of Apostolic Genius, liminality and communitas are much more the normative situation and condition of God's people."

> "The church Jesus built was meant to experience communitas and not community as we normally conceive it. As far as I can tell, this is a nonnegotiable element of Apostolic Genius. The loss of it leads to a diminution of the phenomenon of Apostolic Genius."

---

## Portal 10: Reframation (`reframation`)

### From ReFramation: Seeing God, People, and Mission through Re-enchanted Frames

**Preface**

> "You may be wondering why we have called this book Reframation. Well, in this made-up word, we are drawing attention to the idea that each of us sees everything through a frame. Whether it be God, creation, people, the good news, or the call to mission, each and every 'picture' we encounter is surrounded by a frame, and that frame in some way determines what and how we actually see. Our goal in sharing what we as authors have been learning is for us all to consider what it might look like to put some new frames around these pictures: to reframe our understandings of God, people, and mission."

> "We want to propose a re/enchantment in how we articulate our faith in God. To recover that which has been lost, there needs to be a REmystifying, a REpoeticizing, and a REmythologizing, which will result, with apologies to the protestant reformers of the sixteenth century, in a 'Great Reframation.'"

**Chapter 7: The Great Reframation**

> "An essential part of our theological and missional task today is to participate in a similar reframing and to 'tell this story as clearly as possible, and to allow it to subvert other ways of telling the story of the world.' We are to tell a subversive story."

> "Jesus brought about a reframation by telling a subversive, alternative story. He told a story that is more than science, more than history, more than philosophy, more than anthropology, and more than morality. A story that not only happened once, but is happening still."

---

## Portal 11: Metanoia (`metanoia`)

### From Metanoia: How God Radically Transforms People, Churches, and Organizations From the Inside Out

**Chapter 2: Metanoi-eh?**

> "The Greek term metanoia—traditionally and inadequately translated as 'repentance'—means something more like 'a radical change of mind,' or 'a fundamental intellectual re-orientation,' through which we turn our thinking and living. Repentance means not primarily a sense of regret, but a renunciation of small-minded thinking along with a transformed vision of reality large enough for God's mystery. It is about a transformed metaphysical outlook."

> "Taken together, we believe the best translation of meta-noia is simply 'paradigm shift'—or perhaps more colloquially, the experience of having your mind blown."

> "All in all, metanoia is something like the red pill in the 1999 film The Matrix. Take it and everything changes; you wake up in a new world."

> "Crucially, as we will explore throughout this book, metanoia is not a one-time event but an ongoing process."

> "Metanoia involves a transformational cleansing of perception, which enables a new, expansive, way of viewing the world. It is therefore essential for ongoing transformation and the growth in all knowledge, especially when it comes to experiencing the God who is ever greater."
