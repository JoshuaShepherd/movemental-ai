# The Moravian Movement: Communitas, Liminality, and Missional Impulse

## Context and Background

**Who, What, When, Where:**
The Moravian movement emerged in the early 18th century under the leadership of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700-1760). Beginning at Herrnhut, his estate in Saxony, Germany, the movement became one of the most significant missionary forces of the 18th and 19th centuries, sending more missionaries per capita than any other Christian group.

**Initial Situation and Conditions:**
The movement began when Zinzendorf offered refuge to persecuted Moravian refugees on his estate. These refugees, descendants of the pre-Reformation Unity of Brethren (Unitas Fratrum), had been scattered and persecuted for centuries. Zinzendorf's estate at Herrnhut became a place where they could gather and reorganize.

**Key People Involved:**
- **Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf**: The movement's primary leader and visionary, who created the conditions for communitas and missional impulse
- **Moravian refugees**: The core community that formed at Herrnhut
- **Early Moravian missionaries**: Those sent out from Herrnhut to various parts of the world

**What Makes This Example Relevant:**
The Moravian movement demonstrates the power of communitas (deep community forged in liminality) and how this creates missional impulse. It shows how shared ordeal and purpose generate authentic togetherness that fuels mission. The movement also demonstrates the role of apostolic architecture in organizing for mission.

## The Story

The story begins in 1722 when Zinzendorf offered his estate at Herrnhut as a refuge for persecuted Moravian refugees. These refugees, who had been scattered and persecuted for centuries, found a place where they could gather and reorganize. But what emerged was far more than a refugee settlement.

Under Zinzendorf's leadership, the community at Herrnhut developed a deep sense of communitas—authentic togetherness forged through shared ordeal and purpose. This wasn't comfortable community but deep comradeship that emerged from facing challenges together.

The community organized around shared mission and purpose. They developed what became known as "the Moravian way"—a pattern of life that integrated worship, community, and mission. This pattern included:
- Daily prayer and worship
- Small group communities (choirs) organized by age, gender, and marital status
- Shared work and life
- Focus on mission beyond the community

In 1732, the community sent its first missionaries—two men to the West Indies. This began what became one of the most remarkable missionary movements in history. Over the next century, the Moravians sent more missionaries per capita than any other Christian group. They went to places like Greenland, the West Indies, North America, South Africa, and many other locations.

The movement is also known for its continuous prayer meeting, which lasted for over 100 years. This prayer meeting, organized in shifts so that someone was always praying, demonstrated the community's commitment to sustained intercession for mission.

The Moravian approach combined several key elements:
- Deep communitas forged in liminality
- Missional impulse that sent people out
- Organic organization through choirs (small groups)
- Integration of worship, community, and mission
- Focus on prayer and intercession

## Concepts and Frameworks Demonstrated

**All Six Elements of mDNA in Evidence:**

1. **Jesus is Lord**: The central confession remained, with particular emphasis on the wounds of Christ and the love of God.

2. **Disciple-Making**: The movement focused on making disciples through the choir system—small groups organized by life stage that provided both community and formation.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The movement had a strong outward thrust, sending missionaries to various parts of the world. This missional impulse was fueled by the communitas formed at Herrnhut.

4. **APEST Culture**: All five functions operated. Zinzendorf demonstrated apostolic leadership. The movement had strong prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding (through choirs), and teaching elements.

5. **Organic Systems**: The movement organized through the choir system—organic, small group structures that could reproduce. Each choir was self-contained yet connected to the larger community.

6. **Communitas**: This is perhaps the movement's most distinctive contribution. The deep sense of togetherness forged at Herrnhut through shared ordeal and purpose created authentic community that fueled mission.

**Movement Dynamics:**
- Communitas as the foundation for mission
- Organic organization through choirs
- Missional impulse that sent people out
- Integration of worship, community, and mission
- Focus on prayer and intercession
- Network organization that extended globally

**Liminality and Communitas:**
The Moravian movement demonstrates how liminality (the threshold experience of being in transition) creates communitas (deep community). The refugees at Herrnhut were in a liminal space—between their past persecution and an uncertain future. This liminality, combined with shared purpose and mission, created authentic togetherness that fueled the movement.

## Analysis

**What Worked and Why:**

1. **Communitas as Foundation**: The deep sense of togetherness forged at Herrnhut created the foundation for mission. This wasn't comfortable community but authentic togetherness that emerged from shared ordeal and purpose.

2. **Missional Impulse**: The communitas created a strong outward thrust. People were sent out because they had been formed in authentic community.

3. **Organic Organization**: The choir system provided structure without hierarchy. Each choir was self-contained yet connected to the larger community.

4. **Integration of Elements**: The movement integrated worship, community, and mission rather than separating them. This integration created a holistic approach to Christian life.

5. **Focus on Prayer**: The continuous prayer meeting demonstrated commitment to sustained intercession. This prayer fueled the mission.

**Key Factors for Success:**
- Communitas forged in liminality
- Missional impulse that sent people out
- Organic organization through choirs
- Integration of worship, community, and mission
- Focus on prayer and intercession
- Willingness to send people out

**Challenges Faced and How Addressed:**
- **Persecution and Scattering**: Addressed by creating a place of refuge and reorganizing around shared purpose
- **Maintaining Community While Sending Out**: Addressed through the choir system and network organization
- **Sustaining Mission Over Time**: Addressed through continuous prayer and organic organization

**What Made This Example Significant:**
The Moravian movement demonstrates the power of communitas to fuel mission. It shows how deep community, forged in liminality and shared purpose, creates missional impulse. The movement also demonstrates how organic organization enables both community and mission.

## Lessons Learned

**What We Can Learn:**

1. **Communitas Fuels Mission**: Deep community, forged in liminality and shared purpose, creates missional impulse. We need authentic togetherness, not just comfortable community.

2. **Liminality Creates Communitas**: Threshold experiences, when combined with shared purpose, create authentic community. We need to embrace liminality rather than avoiding it.

3. **Organic Organization Enables Both Community and Mission**: The choir system provided structure for community while enabling mission. We need organic systems that support both.

4. **Integration Is Essential**: The movement integrated worship, community, and mission. We need to integrate these rather than separating them.

5. **Prayer Fuels Mission**: The continuous prayer meeting demonstrated commitment to sustained intercession. We need prayer that fuels mission.

**Transferable Principles:**

- Create conditions for communitas through shared ordeal and purpose
- Embrace liminality rather than avoiding it
- Organize organically to support both community and mission
- Integrate worship, community, and mission
- Focus on prayer that fuels mission
- Send people out from authentic community

**What to Emulate:**
- Communitas forged in liminality
- Missional impulse from authentic community
- Organic organization through small groups
- Integration of worship, community, and mission
- Focus on prayer and intercession
- Willingness to send people out

**What to Avoid:**
- Comfortable community that doesn't fuel mission
- Avoiding liminality and risk
- Hierarchical structures that prevent organic organization
- Separating worship, community, and mission
- Neglecting prayer and intercession
- Keeping people in rather than sending them out

## Contemporary Relevance

**How This Informs Current Practice:**

The Moravian movement challenges us to create authentic community that fuels mission rather than comfortable community that maintains the status quo. It shows that liminality and shared purpose create communitas, and that this communitas generates missional impulse.

**What It Means for Churches Today:**

1. **Communitas Fuels Mission**: We need authentic togetherness, forged in shared purpose and mission, not just comfortable community. This communitas creates missional impulse.

2. **Embrace Liminality**: We need to embrace threshold experiences and risk rather than avoiding them. Liminality creates communitas.

3. **Organic Organization**: We need organic systems that support both community and mission. Small groups can be both places of formation and bases for mission.

4. **Integration**: We need to integrate worship, community, and mission rather than separating them into different programs or departments.

5. **Prayer Fuels Mission**: We need sustained intercession that fuels mission. Prayer is not separate from mission but essential to it.

**How Principles Apply Now:**

- **In Small Groups**: The choir system shows how small groups can be both places of community and bases for mission. We need groups that do both.

- **In Missional Communities**: The Moravian model provides a pattern for how missional communities can be organized—with deep community that fuels mission.

- **In Church Planting**: The movement shows how to send people out from authentic community. Church planters need to be formed in communitas before being sent.

- **In Prayer**: The continuous prayer meeting challenges us to sustained intercession for mission. We need prayer that fuels mission, not just personal devotion.

**The Moravian Way:**

The "Moravian way" provides a pattern for how to integrate worship, community, and mission. This pattern is particularly relevant for churches seeking to become more missional while maintaining deep community.
