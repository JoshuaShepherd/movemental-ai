## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: What are the most common misunderstandings about Apostolic Genius and mDNA, and how do you address them?

**Answer:**

Several common misunderstandings can prevent churches from effectively understanding and applying Apostolic Genius and mDNA. Addressing these misunderstandings is essential for proper understanding and application.

**Common Misunderstandings:**

1. **"Apostolic Genius is just good church practice"**: This misunderstanding misses the systemic nature. Apostolic Genius is not just good practices but a system that emerges when all elements work together. Good practices alone don't create movement.

2. **"We can implement it by adding programs"**: Apostolic Genius isn't something you add; it's something you recover and activate. Programs might help, but they're not the solution. The focus should be on recovery and activation, not addition.

3. **"It only works in certain contexts"**: The evidence from history shows Apostolic Genius working across vastly different cultures, times, and circumstances. While expression varies by context, the principles are universal.

4. **"It requires special resources"**: Remarkable movements often had fewer resources, not more. The Chinese church had no buildings, no professional leadership, no mass meetings. The early church had none of our typical resources. Resources are not the determining factor.

5. **"It's about church growth"**: While movements do grow, Apostolic Genius is about transformation and multiplication, not just numerical increase. The focus is on transformation and reproduction, not just numbers.

6. **"We can focus on just a few elements"**: The systemic nature means all six elements are necessary. Missing even one prevents the system from activating. You can't pick and choose which elements to focus on.

7. **"It's a program we can implement"**: mDNA is a genetic code that's already present. The task is recovery and activation, not implementation of a program. It's about awakening what's already there.

8. **"Some elements are more important than others"**: While contexts may require different emphasis, all elements are necessary for the system to function. The system requires all elements, not just the "important" ones.

9. **"We need to create mDNA"**: mDNA is latent in every church. We need to recover what's been forgotten, not create something new. The DNA is already present; it just needs activation.

10. **"It's only for new churches or church plants"**: mDNA is present in every expression of church, including established, traditional churches. The task is the same: recovery and activation.

**How to Address:**

- Emphasize systemic nature (all elements necessary)
- Clarify recovery vs. creation (latent, not absent)
- Explain universal principles, contextual expression
- Demonstrate historical evidence across contexts
- Show that resources aren't the determining factor
- Focus on transformation and multiplication, not just growth

**Key Points:**
- Multiple common misunderstandings
- Systemic nature often misunderstood
- Recovery vs. creation often confused
- Universal principles, contextual expression

**Examples:**
- Churches trying to add programs instead of recover DNA
- Churches focusing on some elements but not all
- Churches thinking they need to create something new

**Connections:**
- Understanding mDNA correctly
- Proper application of frameworks
- Avoiding common pitfalls

**Practical Application:**
Understanding common misunderstandings helps churches avoid pitfalls and apply frameworks correctly. It prevents wasted effort on wrong approaches.

- How do you recognize misunderstandings?
- What are other common mistakes?
- How do you help others understand correctly?
