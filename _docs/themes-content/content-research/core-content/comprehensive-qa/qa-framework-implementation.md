# Framework Implementation: Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores how to implement the core frameworks—mDNA, APEST/5Q, and the Metanoia Journey—in practical contexts. Implementation requires understanding systemic change, activating frameworks, troubleshooting common challenges, and navigating the complexities of organizational transformation.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers implementing mDNA, activating APEST/5Q, the Metanoia Journey process, troubleshooting challenges, and practical steps for transformation.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from understanding implementation principles, to specific frameworks, to troubleshooting, to practical steps and processes.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to guide implementation, troubleshoot challenges, and navigate the practical aspects of applying frameworks in real contexts.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: How do you implement mDNA in an existing church context?

**Answer:**

Implementing mDNA in an existing church context requires recognizing that mDNA is already present (latent) and needs to be recovered and activated, not imported as an alien system. The approach is recovery and activation rather than creation and importation.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Assessment First:** Begin by assessing which elements are present, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Use the mDNA framework to diagnose the current state. This provides a clear picture of what needs attention.

2. **Systemic Thinking:** Remember that mDNA is systemic—all six elements must work together. You can't implement elements in isolation. Focus on how elements work together, not just individual elements.

3. **Start with "Jesus is Lord":** Since this element is foundational and gives meaning to all others, ensure it's central. This might involve recalibrating around Jesus, simplifying message, and ensuring centrality in teaching and practice.

4. **Address Missing Elements:** Identify which elements are completely missing and begin to introduce them. For example, if APEST culture is missing (only Shepherd and Teacher present), begin to recognize, release, and activate other functions.

5. **Reactivate Suppressed Elements:** Elements might be present but suppressed. For example, communitas might be suppressed in favor of safe, comfortable community. Or missional-incarnational impulse might be suppressed in favor of attractional approaches.

6. **Integration Focus:** Work toward integration—helping elements work together rather than operating as separate silos. This requires cultural change, not just program addition.

7. **Patience and Persistence:** mDNA activation takes time. It's not about quick fixes but systemic change. Like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation, mDNA activation builds over time.

8. **Use the Metanoia Journey:** The Metanoia Journey (Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand, Paradigm, Platform, Practices) provides a process for transformation that enables mDNA activation.

**Practical Steps:**

- Begin with assessment using mDNA framework
- Engage leadership in understanding mDNA and systemic nature
- Identify quick wins (elements easiest to activate)
- Address biggest gaps (missing or suppressed elements)
- Create culture that supports all elements
- Develop practices that embed elements
- Be patient—systemic change takes time

**Key Points:**
- mDNA is latent, needs recovery not creation
- All six elements must work together
- Assessment before action
- Integration over individual elements

**Examples:**
- Churches recovering APEST culture
- Churches reactivating missional impulse
- Churches integrating elements

**Connections:**
- The Metanoia Journey as implementation process
- APEST/5Q activation
- Organic Systems enabling implementation

**Practical Application:**
Use the mDNA framework to assess, then focus on recovery and activation of latent elements, ensuring all elements work together systemically.

**Further Exploration:**
- How do you assess mDNA presence?
- What does activation look like?
- How do you integrate elements?
