# Movement DNA (mDNA): Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores Movement DNA (mDNA)—the six essential elements that must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to activate. Like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every living cell of the church, contains all genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism, is self-replicating, and can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers the six elements individually, how they work together as a system, the DNA metaphor, practical application, and assessment.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from understanding the DNA metaphor and system nature, to exploring each of the six elements, to understanding integration, to practical assessment and application.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to understand the mDNA framework comprehensively, assess churches, and apply the framework practically.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: What is Movement DNA (mDNA), and why is the DNA metaphor used?

**Answer:**

Movement DNA (mDNA) consists of six essential elements that must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to activate: Jesus is Lord (the central confession), Disciple-Making (multiplication through formation), Missional-Incarnational Impulse (going out and going deep), APEST Culture (the fivefold ministry environment), Organic Systems (movemental structures), and Communitas (liminal community).

The DNA metaphor is intentionally chosen because, like biological DNA, mDNA functions in remarkably similar ways. The Encyclopedia Britannica defines DNA as "organic chemical of complex molecular structure that is found in all organic, living cells and in many viruses. DNA codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits." Each characteristic of biological DNA has a parallel in movement DNA.

**DNA is found in every living cell:** In the same way, mDNA is present in every genuine expression of church—it's built into the system. Just as every cell in your body contains the full genetic code, every expression of church contains the full movement DNA. This means the potential for movement exists in every local church, every small group, every believer. You don't need to import it from somewhere else; it's already there.

**DNA contains all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism:** Each element of mDNA carries within it the potential for reproducing the entire movement. Like a seed that contains the whole tree, each part carries the information for the whole. This is why movements can start from small beginnings—a small group, a single community, even one person—and reproduce the full movement. The DNA is complete in every part.

**DNA is self-replicating:** It can be passed from one generation to the next, from one context to another, maintaining the essential characteristics while adapting to new environments. Movement DNA works the same way—it can be passed from person to person, from community to community, from culture to culture, maintaining core identity while adapting to local context. This is how movements spread: not through organizational control but through DNA replication.

**DNA carries vital information for healthy reproduction:** When mDNA is present and functioning, it ensures that new expressions of church maintain the essential characteristics that enable movement. Just as biological DNA ensures a dog reproduces as a dog (not a cat), mDNA ensures that church reproduces as movement (not institution). The DNA contains the information needed for healthy, faithful reproduction.

**DNA can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated:** This is perhaps the most hopeful aspect of the metaphor. Even if mDNA has been suppressed in favor of less demanding forms of church, it can be recovered and reactivated. The DNA is still there; it's just not being expressed. This means churches that have become institutional can rediscover their movemental DNA. The future lies in the womb of the present; the possibility of movement lies at the very heart of every local church, waiting to be awakened.

The "m" in mDNA is inserted purely to differentiate it from biological DNA, but the parallel is intentional. Just as DNA does for biological systems, mDNA does for ecclesial systems. It's the presence of a simple, intrinsic, reproducible, central guiding mechanism that is built into the very structure of authentic Jesus movements.

**Key Points:**
- mDNA consists of six essential elements
- DNA metaphor captures how mDNA functions
- mDNA is present in every expression of church
- It's self-replicating and can be reactivated

**Examples:**
- Early church DNA replicated across the Roman Empire
- Chinese church DNA replicated despite persecution
- DNA present even when suppressed or dormant

**Connections:**
- Apostolic Genius emerges when mDNA elements work together
- Organic systems enable DNA expression
- Disciple-making is the process of DNA transmission

**Practical Application:**
Understanding mDNA helps churches recognize that movement potential is already present—we don't create it, we recover it. It also helps us understand how movements reproduce: through DNA transmission, not program replication.

- How does mDNA replicate?
- What does it mean for mDNA to be suppressed?

### Question 2: What are the six elements of Movement DNA (mDNA)?

**Answer:**

Movement DNA consists of six essential elements that must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to activate. These elements are:

1. **Jesus is Lord** - The central confession that gives meaning to everything else. This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that provides the theological and spiritual foundation for all other elements. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord.

2. **Disciple-Making** - The irreplaceable task of becoming like Jesus and helping others do the same. This is multiplication through formation—not just adding people to the organization but forming them into disciples who can reproduce the movement. Disciple-making ensures that the DNA is passed on faithfully from generation to generation.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Going out and going deep, extending the gospel outward and embedding it deep into culture and context. This draws its inspiration from the incarnation and is energized by the mission of God. It links two practices that form one action: to seed and embed the gospel in different groups, cultures, and societies.

4. **APEST Culture** - The fivefold ministry environment that activates all functions: Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, and Teacher. This is not just having these roles present but creating a culture where all five functions are valued, activated, and integrated. APEST culture enables the church to function with its full intelligence and capacity.

5. **Organic Systems** - Movemental structures that enable reproduction. These are systems organized like living organisms rather than machines—self-organizing, adaptive, reproducible, fractal, and networked. Organic systems enable movements to scale while maintaining core DNA.

6. **Communitas** - Liminal community formed in shared ordeal and purpose. This is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk. Communitas forms in liminal spaces where people face challenges together.

Each element is an irreducible and essential component of the system. mDNA is a concentrated area of focus composed of a complex of theology, practice, and organization that, when working together, encodes movement into the very life and structures of the church. Think of each element as one of six originating instincts—built-in instincts that seem to guide the patterns of behavior of authentic Jesus movements.

**Key Points:**
- Six essential elements, each necessary
- Elements work together as an integrated system
- Each element contributes to movement
- All elements must be present for system to activate

**Examples:**
- Early church demonstrated all six elements
- Movements missing elements don't activate
- Each element visible in historical movements

**Connections:**
- Apostolic Genius emerges when all elements work together
- Elements inform and influence each other
- The systemic nature requiring integration

**Practical Application:**
Understanding the six elements helps churches diagnose which are present, which are missing, and which are suppressed. It provides a framework for assessment and activation.

**Further Exploration:**
- How do the six elements work together?
- What does each element look like in practice?
- Why are all six elements necessary?

### Question 3: Why is mDNA described as "systemic," and what does this mean in practice?

**Answer:**

mDNA is described as "systemic" because the six elements work together as an integrated system where each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. The elements inform and influence one another, creating something greater than the sum of its parts. Like organs in a body, they cannot function properly in isolation.

The systemic nature means that you can enhance one element significantly, but if others are missing or suppressed, the system won't activate. You can have excellent discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have passionate mission, but without disciple-making and communitas, the system won't activate. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate.

This is why churches can be doing many good things—good discipleship, good mission, good community—and still not experience the transformative power of movement. The elements might be there, but they're not working together as an integrated system. They might be operating as separate silos—discipleship over here, mission over there, community somewhere else—without the systemic interaction needed for Apostolic Genius to emerge.

The elements need to inform and influence one another. For example:
- "Jesus is Lord" gives meaning and foundation to all other elements
- Disciple-making ensures multiplication happens
- Missional-Incarnational impulse extends and embeds the gospel
- APEST culture activates full intelligence and capacity
- Organic systems enable reproduction and scaling
- Communitas provides the relational glue and shared purpose

When these elements work together systemically, they create synergy—something greater than the sum of parts. The system that emerges possesses qualities and capacities that don't exist until the system emerges. This is why simply improving individual elements doesn't automatically create movement—you need the system to emerge, and that only happens when all elements interact together.

**Key Points:**
- Elements work together as an integrated system
- Each element is necessary but not sufficient alone
- Elements must inform and influence each other
- The system creates something greater than the sum of parts

**Examples:**
- Churches with excellent programs but missing integration
- Elements operating as silos rather than system
- System activating when all elements work together

**Connections:**
- Apostolic Genius as emergent property of the system
- Organic systems enabling systemic interaction
- The importance of integration

**Practical Application:**
Understanding the systemic nature helps churches see that they need all six elements working together, not just improving individual elements. It shifts focus from programmatic improvement to systemic activation.

**Further Exploration:**
- How do elements inform and influence each other?
- What does systemic integration look like?
- How can churches achieve systemic integration?
