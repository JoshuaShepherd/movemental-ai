# Theological Foundations: Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores the theological foundations underlying the frameworks—biblical foundations, doctrinal connections, theological coherence, and scriptural interpretation. Understanding theological foundations is essential for ensuring frameworks are biblically grounded and theologically sound.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers biblical foundations, doctrinal connections, theological coherence, scriptural interpretation, and integration with theology.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from biblical foundations, to doctrinal connections, to theological coherence, to scriptural interpretation and application.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to understand theological foundations, ensure biblical grounding, and integrate frameworks with theology.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: What are the biblical foundations for mDNA and Apostolic Genius?

**Answer:**

The biblical foundations for mDNA and Apostolic Genius are found throughout Scripture, particularly in the New Testament understanding of the church as a movement, an organism, and a sent people. The frameworks are not imposed on Scripture but emerge from biblical patterns and principles.

**Key Biblical Foundations:**

1. **The Church as Movement:** The book of Acts describes the early church not as an institution but as a movement that spread exponentially. The pattern of multiplication, extension, and transformation evident in Acts demonstrates movement dynamics.

2. **Organic Metaphors:** The Bible uses organic metaphors throughout to describe the church: body (1 Corinthians 12), vine (John 15), building made of living stones (1 Peter 2:5), tree (Romans 11), temple (Ephesians 2:21). These suggest the church is designed to function like a living organism, not a machine.

3. **The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20):** The commission to "make disciples of all nations" describes multiplication through formation—disciples making disciples. This is the pattern of movement reproduction.

4. **Ephesians 4:11-13 (APEST):** The fivefold gifts given by Christ (Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds, Teachers) show that the church is designed with these functions. The passage speaks of attaining "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" when all functions work together.

5. **The Incarnation (John 1:14):** "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" provides the model for missional-incarnational impulse—going deep into culture and context, becoming native rather than remaining separate.

6. **Jesus is Lord (1 Corinthians 8:6, Romans 10:9):** The central confession that eliminates all competing claims to authority. This is the foundation that gives meaning to everything else.

7. **Sent-ness (John 20:21):** "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" establishes the church as sent people, continuing the mission that Jesus began.

8. **The Early Church Pattern (Acts 2:42-47):** The early church demonstrates all six mDNA elements working together: Jesus is Lord (central confession), disciple-making (devotion to apostles' teaching), missional-incarnational (presence in community), APEST (apostles, prophets, teachers functioning), organic systems (house-based, networked), communitas (shared life, risk, purpose).

**Theological Coherence:**

The frameworks are theologically coherent because they:
- Emerge from biblical patterns rather than being imposed
- Reflect God's design for the church
- Align with the nature of the church as organism and movement
- Connect to core doctrines (incarnation, mission, church, discipleship)
- Demonstrate consistency with biblical principles

**Key Points:**
- Biblical foundations throughout Scripture
- Organic metaphors describe church design
- Early church demonstrates mDNA elements
- Frameworks emerge from biblical patterns

**Examples:**
- Book of Acts as movement pattern
- Early church demonstrating all elements
- Biblical metaphors (body, vine, etc.)

**Connections:**
- Biblical theology and ecclesiology
- Doctrinal foundations
- Scriptural interpretation

**Practical Application:**
Understanding biblical foundations ensures frameworks are biblically grounded and theologically sound, not just pragmatic approaches.

**Further Exploration:**
- How do frameworks connect to core doctrines?
- What is the theological coherence?
- How do we interpret Scripture in light of frameworks?
