# Liminality: The Catalyst for Transformative Community

## The Essential Definition

Liminality refers to that situation where people find themselves in an in-between state, having left one place or state but not yet having arrived at the next. It is the experience of being on the threshold, in transition, where normal structures and securities are suspended. In the context of missional movements, liminality is the catalyst that awakens the possibility of communitas—that deeper form of community forged in shared ordeal and purpose. Liminality is not just a temporary experience but often the normative situation for God's people on mission.

## The Full Explanation

Have you ever noticed how people come together in remarkable ways during times of crisis? When the tsunami swept over Asia in 2004, killing about 250,000 people, something equally remarkable happened: it triggered one of the most significant expressions of worldwide generosity and compassion in recent history. Never before had so much international aid been given in any crisis. In and through the crisis, people not only found their common humanity but also found one another in a new and remarkable way.

This is exactly what happened on September 11, 2001, when all the world, but New York particularly, underwent an elemental transformation: people found one another, discovered their common humanity, and experienced a remarkable sense of togetherness and largesse. This is exactly the aspect of the human situation that liminality describes.

The word "liminality" comes from the Latin *limen*, meaning "threshold." It describes that situation where people find themselves in an in-between state, having left one place or state but not yet having arrived at the next. Anthropologist Victor Turner, who studied various rites of passage among tribal peoples, used this term to describe the transition process accompanying a fundamental change of state or social position. During this process, the participant is cast out of the normal structures of life and is humbled, disoriented, and tested to determine whether they will be integrated back into society in a new way.

Liminality applies to that situation where people find themselves in an in-between state that could involve significant danger and disorientation, but not necessarily so. It's the experience of being on the threshold, where normal structures and securities are suspended. This creates conditions wherein people working together can become genuine partners.

In the context of missional movements, liminality is often the normative situation, not just a temporary experience. Both the early church and the Chinese underground church experienced liminality through being outlawed and persecuted. They were constantly in transition, always on the move, never fully settled. This liminal state created the conditions for communitas—that deeper form of community forged in shared ordeal.

The Bible is full of liminal experiences. Think of Abraham, called to leave house and home and all that was familiar, setting out for a land he had never seen. Think of the exodus, where the Israelites left Egypt but hadn't yet arrived at the Promised Land. Think of the exile, where they were in a foreign land, neither here nor there. Think of Jesus, who had nowhere to lay his head, and who discipled his followers on the road in dangerous places. Think of Paul, with his shipwrecks, beatings, and constant travel.

These are not just historical events; they are prescriptive descriptions for the people of God. The church is meant to be a pilgrim people, always on the move, always in transition, always on mission. When we settle down, when we become too comfortable, when we lose the sense of being on a journey, we lose something essential to our identity.

## Biblical Foundations

The Bible is full of liminal experiences. Abraham was called to leave his country, his people, and his father's household and go to a land God would show him (Genesis 12:1). The exodus was a liminal journey—leaving Egypt but not yet arriving at the Promised Land. The exile was a liminal experience—in a foreign land, neither here nor there.

Jesus himself lived a liminal existence. He had nowhere to lay his head (Matthew 8:20). He discipled his followers on the road, in dangerous places. He called them to leave everything and follow him, creating a liminal community.

Paul's life was marked by liminality—shipwrecks, beatings, constant travel, always on the move. He describes his experience: "I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own people, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea" (2 Corinthians 11:26).

The book of Acts shows the early church in constant liminality—persecuted, on the move, always in transition. Hebrews 11 describes the heroes of faith as those who "admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth" (Hebrews 11:13).

## Historical Development

The concept of liminality was developed by anthropologist Victor Turner, who studied rites of passage among tribal peoples. He observed that during transitions, people enter a liminal state where normal structures are suspended, creating conditions for deeper community.

The concept has been applied to missional movements throughout history. The early church experienced liminality through persecution—always on the move, never fully settled. The Chinese underground church experienced liminality through being outlawed—constantly in transition, always at risk.

The concept has been developed in the work:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas"
- *The Faith of Leap* (2011, with Michael Frost): Exploration of risk and adventure
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Application to large churches

## Theological Significance

Liminality matters because it reveals something fundamental about how God shapes his people. It shows us that transformation often happens in the in-between spaces, when we're not fully here or there, when normal structures are suspended.

Liminality is the catalyst that awakens the possibility of communitas. When people are in liminal situations—facing challenge, risk, or adventure together—they find one another in new ways. This creates the deeper form of community that movements need.

The church is meant to be a pilgrim people, always on the move, always in transition, always on mission. When we settle down, when we become too comfortable, we lose something essential. Liminality keeps us moving, keeps us dependent on God, keeps us in mission.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding liminality means:

1. **Embracing Transition**: Recognizing that being in-between is not a problem to solve but a space where transformation happens.

2. **Creating Liminal Experiences**: Intentionally creating spaces where people can experience disorientation and new discovery together.

3. **Mission as Organizing Principle**: Using mission to create liminality—when we engage in risky mission, we enter liminal space.

4. **Avoiding Equilibrium**: Recognizing that equilibrium is a precursor to death. Living systems need to be on the edge of chaos.

5. **Adventure and Risk**: Embracing adventure and risk as part of the Christian life, not something to avoid.

6. **Pilgrim Identity**: Maintaining the identity of a pilgrim people, always on the move, never fully settled.

For individual believers, liminality means recognizing that the Christian life is a journey, not a destination. We're always in transition, always becoming, always on the way. This is not a problem but a gift—it keeps us dependent on God and open to transformation.

## Interconnections

Liminality connects to all other mDNA elements:

- It's created by the **missional-incarnational impulse**—going out creates liminal space
- It forms **communitas**—liminality is the catalyst for deeper community
- It's enabled by **organic systems**—flexible structures that can handle transition
- It requires **disciple-making**—disciples are formed in liminal spaces
- It's grounded in **"Jesus is Lord"**—following Jesus means entering liminal space

Liminality also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's part of the **Metanoia Journey**—transformation happens in liminal space
- It creates **communitas**—the deeper community movements need
- It's activated through **adventure and risk**

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"Liminality is just about transition"**: No, it's often the normative state for God's people on mission. We're meant to be a pilgrim people.

2. **"We should avoid liminality"**: No, it's where transformation happens. We should embrace it, not avoid it.

3. **"Liminality is dangerous"**: Yes, but danger can be good for us. It highlights what's truly important and calls forth resources we didn't know we had.

4. **"Liminality is temporary"**: For movements, liminality is often the normative situation. The early church and Chinese church were constantly in liminal space.

5. **"We need stability"**: Yes, but too much stability leads to equilibrium, which is a precursor to death. We need the right kind of structure that enables movement.

6. **"Liminality is chaos"**: No, it's order at the edge of chaos. It's structured enough to hold together, fluid enough to adapt.
