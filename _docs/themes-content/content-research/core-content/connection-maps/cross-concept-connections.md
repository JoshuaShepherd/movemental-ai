# Cross-Concept Connections: How Major Concepts from Different Frameworks Relate

## Overview

Across Alan Hirsch's body of work, major concepts and frameworks emerge that serve different purposes but are deeply interconnected. Understanding how concepts from different frameworks relate to one another is essential for seeing the integrated whole. This map explores how mDNA, APEST, Metanoia, Paradigm-Platform-Practices, Liminality/Communitas, Disciplism, Reframation, Movement Dynamics, and other major concepts connect and inform each other.

These concepts are not isolated tools to be used separately but parts of an integrated system of understanding. Seeing their connections helps us understand how they work together to create transformative movement.

**Why These Connections Matter:** Leaders often learn individual concepts (mDNA, APEST, Metanoia) but struggle to see how they fit together. Without understanding connections, concepts can feel disconnected or even contradictory. Understanding relationships reveals the integrated nature of the entire system.

**How to Use This Map:** Use this map to see how concepts you're learning connect to others, to understand why certain concepts work better together, to diagnose which concepts might be missing from your approach, and to develop integrated strategies that leverage multiple frameworks.

## Relationship Descriptions

### 1. mDNA and APEST: The System and the Environment

**The Connection:** APEST culture is one of the six elements of mDNA, but APEST also creates the environment where other mDNA elements can function effectively. They're deeply interdependent.

**How They Connect:**
- **APEST as Element:** APEST culture is element #4 of mDNA—the fivefold ministry environment needed for Apostolic Genius.
- **APEST as Enabler:** APEST culture enables other mDNA elements—all five functions are needed for effective disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, organic systems, and communitas.
- **Systemic Relationship:** When APEST culture is weak or truncated (ST-only), other mDNA elements struggle. When APEST is functioning fully, other elements activate more effectively.
- **Mutual Dependence:** mDNA needs APEST to create the ministry environment. APEST needs other mDNA elements to function in movemental context rather than institutional.

**Nature of Relationship:** Integral and enabling. APEST is both part of mDNA and essential for mDNA's activation. They're not separate frameworks but integrated parts of the movement system.

### 2. mDNA and Metanoia: The System and the Process

**The Connection:** mDNA describes what needs to be present for movement (the system). Metanoia describes how organizations can transform to activate that system (the process).

**How They Connect:**
- **Diagnostic Relationship:** The Metanoia Journey helps organizations diagnose where mDNA elements are missing or weak, then develop strategies to activate them.
- **Transformational Process:** Metanoia is the process organizations go through to embed mDNA throughout their culture, structures, and practices.
- **Paradigm-Platform-Practices Alignment:** The Metanoia Journey's Paradigm-Platform-Practices framework helps organizations align thinking, culture/structures, and behaviors with mDNA elements.
- **Systemic Change:** Metanoia recognizes that activating mDNA requires wholehearted transformation (mind, soul, will), not just adding programs.

**Nature of Relationship:** Process and system. Metanoia is how you get there, mDNA is what you're aiming for. The Metanoia Journey is the pathway to activating Apostolic Genius.

### 3. APEST and Metanoia: The Environment and the Transformation

**The Connection:** APEST creates the fivefold environment needed for healthy transformation, and Metanoia is needed to recover the APEST functions that have been exiled.

**How They Connect:**
- **Recovery Process:** Metanoia is essential for recovering exiled APEST functions (APE) in ST-dominated churches.
- **Transformational Environment:** APEST culture creates the diverse intelligence environment where metanoia can function healthily—multiple perspectives enable better paradigm shifts.
- **5Q Integration:** The Metanoia Journey helps organizations embed 5Q (APEST intelligence) throughout the organization, not just in leaders.
- **Complementary Transformation:** APEST needs metanoia to be recovered. Metanoia needs APEST to be sustainable (all five functions working together).

**Nature of Relationship:** Reciprocal transformation. They enable each other—metanoia recovers APEST, APEST enables healthy metanoia.

### 4. Liminality/Communitas and Metanoia: The Context and the Journey

**The Connection:** Liminality and communitas are both mDNA elements and the context/environment that makes the Metanoia Journey possible and necessary.

**How They Connect:**
- **Context for Metanoia:** Liminality (threshold experiences) creates the context where metanoia becomes possible—people are more open to paradigm shifts in liminal spaces.
- **Journey Together:** The Metanoia Journey is a liminal experience—it involves the downcurve (unlearning) and upcurve (relearning) that characterize liminal transitions.
- **Communitas in Transformation:** Communitas (deep community forged in shared risk) provides the support needed for the difficult work of metanoia—transformation happens together.
- **Hero's Journey Pattern:** Both liminality/communitas and metanoia follow the hero's journey pattern—quest, ordeal, return—which is why they connect so naturally.

**Nature of Relationship:** Contextual and patterned. Liminality/communitas create the conditions where metanoia can happen, and metanoia often creates liminal experiences that generate communitas.

### 5. Paradigm-Platform-Practices and mDNA: The Architecture and the System

**The Connection:** Paradigm-Platform-Practices is the three-level architecture for embedding mDNA elements throughout an organization. It's how you structure mDNA activation.

**How They Connect:**
- **Embedding Framework:** Paradigm-Platform-Practices provides the structure for embedding all six mDNA elements at three levels—mind (paradigm), soul (platform), will (practices).
- **System Alignment:** The framework ensures mDNA elements are aligned across thinking, culture/structures, and behaviors—not just added as programs.
- **Movement Architecture:** Paradigm-Platform-Practices is the architecture that enables mDNA to function movementally rather than institutionally.
- **Metanoia Application:** The framework is part of the Metanoia Journey's upcurve—how organizations rebuild around mDNA after unlearning institutional patterns.

**Nature of Relationship:** Structural and architectural. Paradigm-Platform-Practices is how you build mDNA into organizational life at every level.

### 6. Disciplism and mDNA: The Practice and the System

**The Connection:** Disciplism (disciple-making) is both element #2 of mDNA and the essential practice that makes all other mDNA elements work because they must be embodied in people.

**How They Connect:**
- **Essential Element:** Disciple-making is element #2 of mDNA—the essential practice on which Jesus focused his entire ministry.
- **Embodiment Requirement:** All other mDNA elements must be embodied through disciple-making—APEST functions are activated in disciples, missional-incarnational impulse is learned through discipleship, etc.
- **Multiplication Engine:** Disciplism is how mDNA replicates—disciples who make disciples pass on the DNA.
- **Context for Mission:** Disciplism reframes evangelism within discipleship, ensuring the missional-incarnational impulse is grounded in formation.

**Nature of Relationship:** Foundational and multiplicative. Disciplism is both an element of mDNA and the process that makes all elements work because they must be lived, not just understood.

### 7. Movement Dynamics and mDNA: The Outcome and the System

**The Connection:** Movement dynamics describe how movements work. mDNA describes what must be present for movements to emerge. They're outcome and prerequisite.

**How They Connect:**
- **System Activation:** When all mDNA elements are present and functioning, movement dynamics emerge—reproduction, multiplication, network effects, etc.
- **Movement Requirements:** Movement dynamics require mDNA—you can't have sustainable movement without all six elements working together.
- **Organic Systems Connection:** Movement dynamics are enabled by mDNA's organic systems element—how movements organize and reproduce.
- **Apostolic Genius Expression:** Movement dynamics are the expression of Apostolic Genius—what happens when mDNA activates as a system.

**Nature of Relationship:** Causal and descriptive. mDNA creates the conditions for movement dynamics. Movement dynamics are what you see when mDNA is functioning.

### 8. Reframation and APEST: The Vision and the Environment

**The Connection:** Reframation (re-enchanting vision) helps people see APEST functions that have been rendered invisible by reductionistic frames. It's about perception and recovery.

**How They Connect:**
- **Recovery Vision:** Reframation helps leaders see APEST functions that have been lost or forgotten—soft eyes enable recognition of fivefold intelligence.
- **Cultural Perception:** Reframation's emphasis on seeing "traces of God" in culture connects to APEST as universal archetypes present throughout human culture.
- **Re-enchantment:** Reframation's recovery of wonder and mystery helps people see APEST not just as functions but as expressions of God's nature and design.
- **Soft Eyes Application:** The "soft eyes" needed for reframation are the same needed to see APEST as the primordial template for church intelligence.

**Nature of Relationship:** Perceptual and enabling. Reframation enables people to see what's been lost—APEST functions that are present but invisible due to reductionistic frames.

**Source:** *Reframation*, entire book, especially Chapters 5, 10; *5Q*, Preface and Chapter 2

### 9. Hero's Journey and Metanoia: The Pattern and the Process

**The Connection:** The Hero's Journey is the universal archetypal pattern. The Metanoia Journey follows this pattern, making it recognizable and natural to human experience.

**How They Connect:**
- **Universal Pattern:** The Hero's Journey (quest, ordeal, return) is the archetypal pattern found in transformative stories across cultures.
- **Metanoia Structure:** The Metanoia Journey's U-curve follows the hero's journey—downcurve (ordeal/unlearning), upcurve (return/relearning).
- **Christological Pattern:** Both patterns reflect Jesus' journey—incarnation (descent), ministry and passion (ordeal), resurrection and ascension (ascent/return).
- **Natural Recognition:** Because it follows the hero's journey, the Metanoia Journey feels familiar and "right" to people—it matches the pattern of transformative experiences.

**Nature of Relationship:** Patterned and archetypal. The Hero's Journey is the pattern, Metanoia is the specific application for organizational transformation.

### 10. Missional-Incarnational Impulse and Movement Dynamics: The Energy and the Expression

**The Connection:** Missional-incarnational impulse is the energy that drives movement. Movement dynamics are what that energy creates when it's expressed systemically.

**How They Connect:**
- **Energy Source:** Missional-incarnational impulse is the twin movement (going out, going deep) that creates the energy for movement dynamics.
- **Systemic Expression:** When missional-incarnational impulse works with other mDNA elements, it creates movement dynamics—reproduction, multiplication, network effects.
- **Movement Requirement:** Movement dynamics require the missional-incarnational impulse—you can't have sustainable movement without the outward thrust and deep engagement.
- **Organic Expression:** Movement dynamics are the organic expression of missional-incarnational impulse when it's embedded in organic systems.

**Nature of Relationship:** Causal and expressive. Missional-incarnational impulse is the energy, movement dynamics are what that energy creates.

## Integration Principles

### 1. Framework Complementarity

Concepts from different frameworks are not competitors but complements. They serve different purposes in an integrated system. Understanding their connections helps use them together effectively.

### 2. System Thinking

Individual concepts work better when understood as part of larger systems. mDNA is a system, APEST is an environment, Metanoia is a process—they work together as an integrated whole.

### 3. Contextual Application

Different concepts are needed in different contexts. Understanding connections helps know when to apply which frameworks and how they work together in specific situations.

### 4. Embodiment Requirement

Most concepts must be embodied to work. Understanding how Disciplism connects to other concepts reminds us that knowledge isn't enough—concepts must be lived.

### 5. Transformational Integration

Recovering lost concepts often requires transformation. Understanding how Metanoia connects to mDNA and APEST shows that recovering movement requires organizational transformation.

---

## Practical Implications

### For Learning

When learning new concepts:
- **Connect to Known:** Relate new concepts to ones you already understand
- **See the System:** Understand how concepts fit into larger frameworks
- **Identify Relationships:** Note how concepts depend on or enable others
- **Build Integration:** Develop understanding of how concepts work together

### For Application

When applying concepts:
- **Use Together:** Don't apply concepts in isolation—they work better together
- **Address System:** Focus on systems, not just individual concepts
- **Enable Integration:** Create conditions where concepts can work together
- **Monitor Relationships:** Watch how strengthening one concept affects others

### For Diagnosis

When diagnosing problems:
- **Check Connections:** See if missing concepts are causing issues
- **Examine Relationships:** Understand how weak relationships affect the whole
- **System Diagnosis:** Look at systems, not just individual problems
- **Integration Assessment:** Evaluate whether concepts are working together

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Integrated Movement Activation

An organization applying multiple concepts together:
- **mDNA Diagnosis:** Identifies missing elements (weak APEST, institutional systems)
- **Metanoia Process:** Embarks on transformation journey
- **Paradigm-Platform-Practices:** Structures change at three levels
- **APEST Recovery:** Recovers exiled functions through metanoia
- **Liminality/Communitas:** Creates context for transformation
- **Result:** Movement dynamics emerge as system activates

### Example 2: Isolated Concept Application (Common Problem)

An organization applying concepts separately:
- **APEST Assessment:** Identifies missing functions
- **No Metanoia:** Tries to add functions without transformation
- **No mDNA Context:** Doesn't connect to movement system
- **No Paradigm Shift:** Doesn't change thinking, just adds programs
- **Result:** Limited impact, functions don't integrate, no movement

### Example 3: Reframation Enabling Recovery

An organization using reframation to enable other concepts:
- **Soft Eyes Development:** Learns to see differently
- **APEST Recognition:** Begins to see fivefold intelligence everywhere
- **mDNA Perception:** Sees movement DNA as present but dormant
- **Metanoia Readiness:** Openness to transformation increases
- **Result:** Better prepared for integrated transformation
