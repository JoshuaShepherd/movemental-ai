# Foundational Theme Connections: How Foundational Themes Build on Each Other

## Overview

The foundational themes in Alan Hirsch's body of work don't exist in isolation—they build upon one another in a logical and theological hierarchy. Understanding how these themes connect and depend on each other is essential for grasping the integrated whole. Just as "Jesus is Lord" forms the foundation for everything else, so too do these themes build upon one another.

This map explores the foundational themes, how they connect, which themes are prerequisites for others, and how they create a coherent whole. Understanding these connections helps see why certain themes must come first and how they enable others.

**Why These Connections Matter:** Learning themes in isolation leads to incomplete understanding. Seeing how themes build on each other reveals the logical progression and theological hierarchy that makes the entire system coherent.

**How to Use This Map:** Use this map to understand the proper order for learning themes, to see why certain themes must be foundational, to identify which themes you might be missing, and to understand how themes enable each other.

## Theme Hierarchy and Dependencies

### Level 1: The Absolute Foundation

#### 1. Jesus Is Lord: The Heart of It All

**Position:** Absolute center and foundation. Not merely one theme among many, but the foundational confession that gives meaning and coherence to everything else.

**Connections to Other Themes:**
- **→ Apostolic Genius/mDNA:** The lordship of Jesus is element #1 of mDNA, but more than that, it gives theological meaning to the entire system.
- **→ APEST/5Q:** The fivefold functions are gifts from the ascended Lord (Ephesians 4:7-11), designed to extend his ministry.
- **→ Discipleship:** Discipleship means becoming disciples of the Lord Jesus—his lordship defines what discipleship is.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** The confession eliminates competing claims and sends us in mission because we serve a missionary God.
- **→ Movement Dynamics:** Movements that maintain Jesus' centrality find themselves both persecuted and powerful.
- **→ Metanoia:** Metanoia brings us in sync with the mind of Christ—seeing the world from God's perspective.
- **→ Liminality/Communitas:** Deep community forms when people share ultimate allegiance to Jesus, especially in contexts of risk.
- **→ Organic Systems:** The church's organic nature derives from being the body of the living Christ.
- **→ Reframation:** Reframation calls us to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus.

**Nature of Dependence:** All other themes depend on this foundation. Without "Jesus is Lord" at the center, other themes lose their theological grounding and become mere techniques or strategies.

### Level 2: The System Frameworks

#### 2. Apostolic Genius and mDNA: The Movement System

**Position:** The system framework that describes what must be present for transformative movement. Builds directly on "Jesus is Lord" as the foundation.

**Connections to Other Themes:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Gets its meaning and coherence from the lordship of Jesus.
- **→ APEST/5Q:** APEST culture is element #4 of mDNA, creating the fivefold environment.
- **→ Discipleship:** Disciple-making is element #2 of mDNA—the essential practice.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Element #3 of mDNA—the outward movement.
- **→ Movement Dynamics:** Describes what happens when mDNA activates—the outcome.
- **→ Liminality/Communitas:** Element #6 of mDNA—the liminal community.
- **→ Organic Systems:** Element #5 of mDNA—movemental structure.
- **→ Metanoia:** The process for embedding mDNA throughout organizations.

**Nature of Dependence:** mDNA provides the system framework. Other themes either are elements of mDNA or describe how to activate/recover mDNA. Understanding mDNA helps see how other themes fit together.

**Prerequisites:** Jesus Is Lord (foundational meaning)

**Source:** *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapters 3-9; *On the Verge*, Chapter 4

#### 3. APEST/5Q: The Fivefold Intelligence

**Position:** The ministry framework that creates the environment where movement can happen. Both an element of mDNA and an enabling framework.

**Connections to Other Themes:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Fivefold functions are gifts from the ascended Lord, designed to extend his ministry.
- **From/To mDNA:** APEST culture is element #4 of mDNA, but APEST also enables other mDNA elements to function.
- **→ Discipleship:** All five functions are activated through disciple-making—every disciple should develop fivefold capacities.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** All five functions are needed for effective mission—pioneering, challenging, recruiting, caring, grounding.
- **→ Movement Dynamics:** APEST creates the diverse intelligence environment where movement can emerge.
- **→ Metanoia:** Essential for recovering exiled APEST functions (APE) in ST-dominated churches.
- **→ Organic Systems:** APEST enables distributed leadership (intelligence throughout) rather than hierarchical control.
- **→ Liminality/Communitas:** Fivefold functions work best in communitas contexts where people share mission and risk.

**Nature of Dependence:** APEST is both part of mDNA and essential for mDNA's activation. Understanding APEST helps understand how other themes require diverse intelligence to function.

**Prerequisites:** Jesus Is Lord (source of gifts), mDNA (system context)

### Level 3: Essential Practices

#### 4. Discipleship and Disciple-Making: The Essential Practice

**Position:** The essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. Element #2 of mDNA and the practice that makes all other themes work.

**Connections to Other Themes:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Discipleship begins by acknowledging Jesus as Lord and learning to live under his lordship.
- **From mDNA:** Element #2 of mDNA—the essential practice.
- **From/To APEST:** All five functions are activated through disciple-making. Discipleship ensures APEST is embodied in people.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Discipleship that doesn't include mission is incomplete. Mission that doesn't form disciples is shallow.
- **→ Movement Dynamics:** Disciple-making is the multiplication engine—disciples who make disciples pass on movement DNA.
- **→ Metanoia:** Personal metanoia is essential for discipleship—ongoing conversion and transformation.
- **→ Liminality/Communitas:** Discipleship deepens in liminal contexts where communitas forms.
- **→ Organic Systems:** Disciple-making happens relationally and organically (Jesus → Twelve → Seventy → multitudes).
- **→ Reframation:** Disciplism reframes evangelism within discipleship, ensuring formation precedes or accompanies recruitment.

**Nature of Dependence:** Discipleship is both a theme and the essential practice. All other themes must be embodied through discipleship to work. Without it, themes remain abstract.

**Prerequisites:** Jesus Is Lord (what discipleship means), mDNA (system context)

**Source:** *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 5; *Untamed*, entire book; *Disciplism*, entire book

#### 5. Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Going Out and Going Deep

**Position:** The twin movements that characterize authentic engagement with the world. Element #3 of mDNA and the energy that drives movement.

**Connections to Other Themes:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Mission flows from God's missionary nature. Incarnation models how we engage culture.
- **From mDNA:** Element #3 of mDNA—the outward movement.
- **From Discipleship:** Mission is where discipleship is tested and deepened. The impulse sends disciples into the world.
- **From APEST:** All five functions are needed for effective mission—pioneering, challenging, recruiting, caring, grounding.
- **→ Movement Dynamics:** The impulse creates the energy that drives movement dynamics—reproduction, multiplication, network effects.
- **→ Liminality/Communitas:** Mission creates liminality, which generates communitas. Shared adventure forms deep community.
- **→ Organic Systems:** Requires flexible, adaptive systems that can respond to different contexts.
- **→ Reframation:** Incarnational mission requires deep cultural engagement and "romancing the city" that reframation enables.

**Nature of Dependence:** The impulse is both a theme and the energy source. It drives movement and creates conditions for other themes (like communitas) to emerge.

**Prerequisites:** Jesus Is Lord (missionary God), mDNA (system context), Discipleship (embodied practice)

## Integration Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Dependencies

Themes build on each other in a logical hierarchy. You can't fully understand later themes without grasping foundational ones. "Jesus is Lord" must come first, then system frameworks, then practices, then outcomes.

### 2. Prerequisites Matter

Certain themes are prerequisites for others. For example, you can't have movement dynamics without mDNA elements working together. You can't recover APEST without metanoia. Understanding prerequisites helps in proper implementation.

### 3. Reciprocal Relationships

While themes build on each other hierarchically, they also have reciprocal relationships. For example, Discipleship and Missional-Incarnational Impulse reinforce each other. APEST and mDNA enable each other.

### 4. Systemic Coherence

Themes create a coherent whole when understood together. They're not isolated ideas but parts of an integrated system. Understanding connections reveals the system's coherence.

### 5. Embodiment Requirement

Most themes must be embodied to work. Understanding hierarchical dependencies helps ensure themes are embodied in proper order—foundation first, then building.

---

## Practical Implications

### For Learning

When learning the themes:
- **Start with Foundation:** Begin with "Jesus is Lord"—understand the center before the system.
- **Build Systematically:** Learn themes in hierarchical order—foundation → frameworks → practices → outcomes.
- **See Connections:** Always relate new themes to foundational ones.
- **Understand Dependencies:** Recognize which themes depend on others.

### For Implementation

When implementing themes:
- **Foundation First:** Ensure "Jesus is Lord" is central before building systems.
- **System Context:** Understand themes as parts of systems, not isolated tools.
- **Proper Order:** Implement themes in logical order—don't jump ahead without foundations.
- **Integration:** Help themes work together, not in isolation.

### For Diagnosis

When diagnosing issues:
- **Check Foundation:** Is "Jesus is Lord" truly central?
- **Examine Dependencies:** Are prerequisite themes weak or missing?
- **Assess Integration:** Are themes working together or isolated?
- **System Evaluation:** Is the system coherent or fragmented?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Proper Thematic Development

A church developing themes in proper order:
- **Foundation:** Establishes "Jesus is Lord" as absolute center
- **System:** Understands mDNA as integrated system
- **Environment:** Develops APEST culture
- **Practice:** Focuses on disciple-making
- **Movement:** Engages missional-incarnational impulse
- **Result:** Movement dynamics emerge as themes work together

### Example 2: Missing Foundation (Common Problem)

A church implementing themes without foundation:
- **Skips Foundation:** Doesn't establish "Jesus is Lord" centrality
- **Adds Systems:** Tries to implement mDNA elements as techniques
- **Adds Practices:** Attempts disciple-making without theological grounding
- **Result:** Themes become strategies rather than theological realities, limited impact

### Example 3: Isolated Themes (Common Problem)

A church learning themes in isolation:
- **No Hierarchy:** Doesn't understand how themes build on each other
- **No Dependencies:** Tries to implement themes without prerequisites
- **No Integration:** Doesn't see how themes work together
- **Result:** Fragmented understanding, themes compete rather than complement
