# mDNA Element Relationships: The Integrated System of Apostolic Genius

## Overview

Movement DNA (mDNA) consists of six essential elements that must work together as an integrated system to activate Apostolic Genius—that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that transforms communities into world-changing movements. Understanding how these elements relate to one another is crucial, because Apostolic Genius doesn't emerge from isolated elements but from their dynamic interrelationship.

Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. The system activates only when all six elements are present and functioning together. This map explores the relationships, dependencies, interactions, and system dynamics that make mDNA function as an integrated whole.

**Why These Connections Matter:** Churches often focus on individual elements (better discipleship, improved mission, stronger community) without understanding how these elements depend on and inform one another. Without seeing the system, we can enhance individual elements and still miss the transformative power of Apostolic Genius.

**How to Use This Map:** Use this map to diagnose why your church might be doing good things but not experiencing movement, to understand how to integrate elements you're already working on, and to see the dependencies that must be addressed simultaneously.

## Relationship Descriptions

### 1. Jesus Is Lord: The Central Hub

**Centrality:** "Jesus is Lord" is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that gives meaning and coherence to everything else. All other elements radiate from this center and find their ultimate purpose in relation to it.

**Relationships:**
- **→ Disciple-Making:** The lordship of Jesus defines what discipleship means—we become disciples of the Lord Jesus, not just followers of principles or programs.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** The confession "Jesus is Lord" eliminates all competing claims (Caesar, consumerism, nationalism) and sends us out in mission because we serve a missionary God.
- **→ APEST Culture:** The fivefold functions are gifts from the ascended Lord Jesus (Ephesians 4), designed to extend his ministry through his body.
- **→ Organic Systems:** The church's organic nature derives from being the body of the living Christ, not a human institution.
- **→ Communitas:** The deep community forms when people share allegiance to Jesus as Lord, especially in contexts of risk and mission.

**Nature of Relationship:** Foundational and directional. Everything flows from and returns to the lordship of Jesus. Without this center, other elements lose their theological grounding and become mere techniques.

### 2. Disciple-Making: The Essential Practice

**Centrality:** Disciple-making is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. It is the practice that ensures the other elements are embodied in people rather than remaining abstract concepts.

**Relationships:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Discipleship begins by acknowledging Jesus as Lord and learning to live under his lordship in every area of life.
- **→ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Discipleship that doesn't include mission is incomplete—Jesus' disciples are sent (John 20:21). Mission that doesn't form disciples is shallow—we're making converts, not disciples.
- **→ APEST Culture:** Discipleship activates all fivefold functions in people—every disciple should be developing apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching capacities.
- **→ Organic Systems:** Disciple-making happens relationally and organically (Jesus → Twelve → Seventy → multitudes), not through programs alone.
- **→ Communitas:** Discipleship deepens in liminal contexts where communitas forms—challenge and mission create the environment for authentic formation.

**Nature of Relationship:** Essential and multiplicative. Disciple-making is how all other elements become embodied. Without it, concepts remain abstract and movements lack the people who can multiply them.

### 3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse: The Outward Movement

**Centrality:** The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational).

**Relationships:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Mission flows from God's missionary nature revealed in Jesus. Incarnation models how we engage culture—as God became human, we become native to our contexts.
- **From Disciple-Making:** Mission is where discipleship is tested and deepened. The impulse sends disciples into the world rather than keeping them safe in enclaves.
- **→ APEST Culture:** The impulse requires all five functions—apostles pioneer new ground, prophets call to faithfulness, evangelists proclaim good news, shepherds care in context, teachers ground in truth.
- **→ Organic Systems:** Missional-incarnational engagement requires flexible, adaptive systems that can respond to different contexts rather than rigid programs.
- **→ Communitas:** Mission creates liminality, which generates communitas. The shared adventure of mission forms deep community that attractional approaches cannot create.

**Nature of Relationship:** Reciprocal and catalytic. Mission both requires and creates the conditions for other elements to function. Without this impulse, the church becomes inward-focused and loses its transformative edge.

### 4. APEST Culture: The Fivefold Environment

**Centrality:** APEST culture creates the ministry environment where all fivefold functions operate, ensuring the church has the full range of intelligence and capacity needed for movement.

**Relationships:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** The fivefold functions are gifts from the ascended Lord (Ephesians 4:7-11), designed to extend his fivefold ministry through the church.
- **From Disciple-Making:** Discipleship activates all five functions in people. Every disciple should be developing their dominant gift while appreciating others.
- **From Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** All five functions are needed for effective mission—apostles pioneer, prophets call to covenant faithfulness, evangelists recruit, shepherds nurture in context, teachers ground in truth.
- **→ Organic Systems:** APEST culture creates distributed leadership (intelligence throughout the system) rather than hierarchical control, enabling organic, movemental organization.
- **→ Communitas:** The fivefold functions work best in communitas contexts where people share mission and risk, not in safe, consumeristic community.

**Nature of Relationship:** Environmental and enabling. APEST culture creates the conditions where other elements can function effectively. Without it, movements lack the full range of capacity needed for adaptive mission.

### 5. Organic Systems: The Movemental Structure

**Centrality:** Organic systems enable movements to scale while maintaining core DNA, organizing like living organisms rather than machines.

**Relationships:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** The church is the body of the living Christ, an organism, not a human institution.
- **From Disciple-Making:** Organic systems pass DNA through relational disciple-making, not through policies and procedures alone.
- **From Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Organic systems adapt to different contexts while maintaining core identity, enabling incarnational engagement.
- **From APEST Culture:** Organic systems distribute intelligence (all five functions) throughout rather than concentrating it at the top, enabling movemental scale.
- **→ Communitas:** Organic systems facilitate the kind of distributed, networked relationships that create communitas rather than hierarchical control that kills it.

**Nature of Relationship:** Structural and enabling. Organic systems provide the architecture that allows other elements to function movementally. Without them, good intentions get trapped in institutional forms.

### 6. Communitas: The Liminal Community

**Centrality:** Communitas is the deep community forged in liminal (threshold) experiences, especially shared mission and risk.

**Relationships:**
- **From Jesus Is Lord:** Communitas forms when people share ultimate allegiance to Jesus, especially when that allegiance requires sacrifice and risk.
- **From Disciple-Making:** Communitas creates the environment where authentic discipleship deepens—we learn together through shared adventure.
- **From Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Mission creates liminality, which generates communitas. Safe, attractional approaches produce community, not communitas.
- **From APEST Culture:** Communitas enables the fivefold functions to work together—deep community allows different gifts to complement rather than compete.
- **From Organic Systems:** Communitas thrives in organic, distributed systems where relationships matter more than hierarchy.

**Nature of Relationship:** Environmental and catalytic. Communitas creates the conditions where other elements function authentically. Without it, community becomes consumeristic and mission becomes maintenance.

### Relationship Flow

**Centric Model:** All elements connect to "Jesus Is Lord" as the center, but they also interact with each other:

1. **Jesus Is Lord** → flows into all other elements (foundational)
2. **Disciple-Making** ↔ **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** (reciprocal—disciples are sent, mission forms disciples)
3. **APEST Culture** ↔ **Organic Systems** (APEST enables distributed leadership, organic systems facilitate APEST)
4. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** ↔ **Communitas** (mission creates liminality, which generates communitas)
5. **Disciple-Making** ↔ **Communitas** (discipleship deepens in communitas, communitas forms through shared discipleship)
6. All elements reinforce **Organic Systems** (they all function better in organic rather than institutional forms)

### Dependencies

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Apostolic Genius cannot activate without ALL six elements present
- "Jesus Is Lord" is foundational—other elements lose meaning without it
- Disciple-Making is essential—other elements remain abstract without it
- Missional-Incarnational Impulse is catalytic—it creates conditions for other elements
- APEST Culture enables—it provides the full range of capacity needed
- Organic Systems facilitate—they allow elements to function movementally
- Communitas creates environment—it enables authentic expression of other elements

## Integration Principles

### 1. System Thinking

mDNA functions as a system, not a checklist. Individual elements can be enhanced, but Apostolic Genius emerges only when all elements work together. This is why churches can be doing good discipleship, good mission, and have good community but still not experience movement—they're missing elements or not seeing the system.

### 2. Necessary but Not Sufficient

Each element is necessary—remove one, and the system won't activate. But no single element is sufficient—enhance one without others, and you still won't get movement. This is why focusing on one element (like discipleship) while neglecting others (like APEST culture) fails to produce Apostolic Genius.

### 3. Emergent Property

Apostolic Genius is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges. Like a smartphone operating system represents a paradigmatic upgrade, Apostolic Genius represents a fundamentally different way of organizing and operating compared to institutional forms of church.

### 4. Latency and Activation

mDNA is latent in every expression of church—present but potentially dormant. The future lies in the womb of the present; the potential for movement already exists within every church, waiting to be awakened when all elements are activated together.

### 5. Dynamic Interrelationship

Elements don't just coexist; they inform, reinforce, and depend on one another. Understanding these relationships helps diagnose problems and develop strategies that address the system, not just symptoms.

## Practical Implications

### For Diagnosis

When a church isn't experiencing movement, use this map to diagnose:
- **Missing Elements:** Are all six elements present?
- **Weak Relationships:** Are elements isolated or integrated?
- **Dependency Issues:** Are foundational elements (Jesus Is Lord, Disciple-Making) weak?
- **Environmental Problems:** Is APEST culture or communitas missing, creating an environment where other elements can't function?

### For Strategy

When developing strategies for movement:
- **Address the System:** Don't just enhance one element—work on the system
- **Start with Foundation:** Ensure "Jesus Is Lord" is central and disciple-making is happening
- **Create Environment:** Build APEST culture and communitas, which enable other elements
- **Enable Structure:** Develop organic systems that allow movemental function
- **Maintain Integration:** Keep elements working together, not in isolation

### For Leadership

Leaders must:
- **See the System:** Understand relationships, not just elements
- **Think Systematically:** Address multiple elements simultaneously
- **Nurture Integration:** Help elements work together, not compete
- **Diagnose Holistically:** Understand how weak elements affect the whole
- **Build Movementally:** Create systems that support all elements

## Examples

### Example 1: The Chinese Underground Church

All six elements were present and functioning together:
- **Jesus Is Lord:** Central confession that sustained under persecution
- **Disciple-Making:** Rigorous formation despite lack of resources
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Engaged culture despite danger
- **APEST Culture:** All five functions operating, not just clergy
- **Organic Systems:** Distributed, networked organization
- **Communitas:** Deep community forged through shared risk

Result: Movement from 2 million to 120 million in 70 years under persecution.

### Example 2: The Early Church

All six elements evident:
- **Jesus Is Lord:** Core confession that challenged Caesar
- **Disciple-Making:** Formation through life-on-life relationships
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Sent out, becoming native to contexts
- **APEST Culture:** All five functions present and active
- **Organic Systems:** Networked, multiplying communities
- **Communitas:** Deep community through shared mission and persecution

Result: Transformed the Roman Empire in two centuries.

### Example 3: Modern Church Missing Elements

A church with good discipleship and mission but missing:
- Weak APEST culture (only ST functions operating)
- Institutional rather than organic systems
- Consumeristic community rather than communitas

Result: Good practices but no movement—missing elements prevent system activation.

*Understanding mDNA element relationships is essential for activating Apostolic Genius. The elements don't work in isolation—they form an integrated system where each element enables and depends on the others. When all six elements are present and functioning together, something fundamentally different emerges: Apostolic Genius, the movement system that transforms communities into world-changing movements.*
