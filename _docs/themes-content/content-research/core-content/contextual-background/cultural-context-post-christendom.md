# Cultural Context: The Post-Christendom Shift

## Context Overview

The work emerges in and responds to a significant cultural shift: the transition from Christendom (where Christianity held cultural dominance and privilege) to a post-Christendom context (where Christianity is increasingly marginalized and the church must operate as a missionary movement in its own culture). Understanding this cultural context is essential for grasping why the work emphasizes missional, incarnational, and movemental approaches rather than attractional, institutional models.

This context matters because it reveals that the frameworks and concepts are not abstract theological exercises but responses to real cultural changes that require the church to fundamentally rethink how it operates. The shift from Christendom to post-Christendom represents one of the most significant cultural transitions in Western history, and the work provides frameworks for navigating this new reality.

## Detailed Contextual Information

### The Christendom Paradigm

Christendom refers to the historical period (roughly from Constantine to the modern era) when Christianity held cultural dominance in the West. Key characteristics:

**Cultural Privilege**: Christianity was the assumed, default religion. Church and state were intertwined, and Christian values shaped public life.

**Attractional Model**: The church could operate on an attractional model—people came to church because it was the cultural norm. The church didn't need to go to people; people came to the church.

**Institutional Stability**: The church operated as a stable institution with buildings, professional clergy, and established programs. Maintenance and preservation were primary concerns.

**Assumed Christianity**: Most people were assumed to be Christian by birth and cultural association. The task was to maintain and nurture existing Christians rather than make new disciples.

**Programmatic Approach**: The church could rely on programs and events to serve existing members. The focus was on providing services for those already in the fold.

### The Post-Christendom Shift

Post-Christendom represents the cultural shift away from Christian dominance to a context where:

**Cultural Marginalization**: Christianity is no longer the default. The church is increasingly marginalized, and Christian values no longer shape public life in the same way.

**Missionary Context**: The church must operate as a missionary movement in its own culture. The attractional model no longer works because people don't automatically come to church.

**Movemental Necessity**: The church must become mobile, adaptable, and reproducible. Institutional stability is no longer sufficient; movemental energy is required.

**Unchurched Population**: Most people are no longer assumed to be Christian. The task shifts from maintaining existing Christians to making new disciples and engaging those outside the church.

**Missional Engagement**: The church must go to people rather than expecting them to come. The focus shifts from providing services for members to engaging missionally in culture.

### The Cultural Moment (2000s-2020s)

The work emerges during a period of accelerating cultural change:

**Declining Church Attendance**: Statistics show declining attendance and engagement in traditional churches across the West.

**Rising "Nones"**: Increasing numbers of people identify as having no religious affiliation.

**Cultural Pluralism**: Western societies become increasingly pluralistic, with multiple worldviews competing for allegiance.

**Postmodern Sensibilities**: Cultural shifts toward postmodern thinking challenge modern assumptions about truth, authority, and meaning.

**Digital Revolution**: The internet and digital technologies transform how people connect, learn, and engage with information.

**Globalization**: Increased awareness of global diversity and interconnectedness challenges parochial perspectives.

### The Missional Church Conversation

The work emerges within and contributes to the broader "missional church" conversation that developed in response to the post-Christendom shift. Key themes:

**Missio Dei**: Mission is understood as God's mission, not the church's mission. The church participates in what God is doing in the world.

**Incarnational Engagement**: The church must become native to its contexts, engaging culture deeply rather than remaining separate.

**Movemental Organization**: The church must organize as a movement—mobile, adaptable, reproducible—rather than as a static institution.

**Disciple-Making Focus**: The primary task shifts from maintaining programs to making disciples who can make disciples.

**APEST Recovery**: The church must recover the fivefold functions that enable missional engagement and movemental multiplication.

### The Challenge of Middle-Class Culture

A significant cultural challenge identified in the work is middle-class culture, which functions as an "anti-missional virus":

**Security Focus**: Middle-class culture prioritizes security, comfort, and stability—values that conflict with the risk and adventure required for mission.

**Consumerism**: Consumeristic values shape how people engage with church, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach rather than disciple-making.

**Risk Aversion**: Middle-class culture is risk-averse, preferring safety over adventure, which erodes the liminal edge necessary for communitas.

**Comfort Over Mission**: The pursuit of comfort and convenience conflicts with the demands of missional engagement and incarnational presence.

**Status and Success**: Middle-class definitions of success (wealth, status, achievement) can conflict with the values of the kingdom.

### The Response: Missional Frameworks

The work provides frameworks for navigating post-Christendom:

**Apostolic Genius**: The framework helps churches recover movemental energy and operate as missionary movements rather than maintenance institutions.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The twin movements of going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational) enable engagement in post-Christendom contexts.

**Movement Dynamics**: Understanding how movements work helps churches adapt to a context that requires mobility and multiplication rather than stability and preservation.

**Disciplism**: Reframing evangelism within discipleship addresses the challenge of engaging an unchurched population that requires formation, not just information.

**Reframation**: Re-enchanting our vision of God, people, and mission helps us engage a culture that has lost wonder and needs to see the gospel afresh.

**Metanoia**: The capacity for paradigm shift and transformation is essential for navigating the adaptive challenges of post-Christendom.

## Connection to Core Content

This cultural context directly informs core concepts:

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The post-Christendom shift requires the church to go out (missional) and go deep (incarnational) rather than operating on an attractional model.

**Apostolic Genius**: The framework helps churches recover movemental energy needed for post-Christendom contexts where institutional stability is no longer sufficient.

**Movement Dynamics**: Understanding movement is essential because post-Christendom requires the church to operate as a movement rather than an institution.

**Disciplism**: The reframing of evangelism within discipleship addresses the challenge of engaging an unchurched population in post-Christendom.

**Liminality and Communitas**: Post-Christendom requires the church to embrace risk and adventure, creating the liminal edge necessary for authentic communitas.

**APEST Recovery**: The recovery of fivefold functions is essential for missional engagement in post-Christendom, where the church needs all its capacities for cultural engagement.

**Reframation**: Re-enchanting vision is necessary for engaging a culture that has lost wonder and needs to see the gospel through fresh frames.

**Metanoia**: The capacity for transformation is essential for navigating the adaptive challenges of post-Christendom, which require paradigm shifts rather than technical solutions.

## Relevance for Today

This cultural context matters now because:

**It Explains the Need**: Understanding the post-Christendom shift explains why traditional approaches are no longer effective and why new frameworks are needed.

**It Validates the Approach**: The cultural context validates that missional, movemental approaches are not optional but necessary for engaging post-Christendom reality.

**It Provides Direction**: Understanding the cultural shift provides direction for how the church should adapt and respond.

**It Challenges Assumptions**: The cultural context challenges assumptions about what the church is and how it should operate, calling for fundamental rethinking.

**It Connects to Mission**: The post-Christendom context makes mission not optional but essential. The church must engage missionally or become irrelevant.

**It Offers Hope**: Understanding the cultural shift provides hope that the church can adapt and thrive in new contexts by recovering movemental DNA.
