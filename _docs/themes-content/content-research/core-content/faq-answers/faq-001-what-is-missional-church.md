# What is Missional Church?

## Direct Answer

A missional church is a church that understands itself as a sent people, participating in God's mission to restore and heal creation. Rather than expecting people to come to them (attractional approach), missional churches go to people, embedding themselves in culture and becoming native to their context. The term "missional" comes from recognizing that mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative—God is a missionary God, and therefore the church exists as a missionary people.

A missional church operates from the understanding that God is already at work in the world, and the church's role is to join what God is doing rather than trying to get God to bless what the church is doing. This means going out (missional impulse) and going deep (incarnational impulse)—extending the gospel outward into culture while also embedding it deeply within specific contexts, just as God became flesh and dwelt among us in Jesus Christ.

The missional church recognizes that it is intrinsically incarnational; it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. This involves presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation—six practices that enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

## Expanded Explanation

The shift to missional thinking represents a fundamental paradigm change in how we understand the church's relationship to mission. For much of the last fifty years, the church has operated from a church-centered understanding of mission—mission was something the church did, an activity among many activities. But missional thinking recognizes that mission is God-centered: mission is not what the church does but what God is doing, and the church participates in that mission.

This shift has profound implications. When we understand that God is a missionary God, we recognize that the church doesn't have a mission; God's mission has a church. The church exists as a result of God's mission, not the other way around. This means the church is inherently missional—it's not an optional add-on but the very nature of what it means to be the people of God.

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world. The **missional impulse** refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. It's the "sneeze-like" influence that releases the outward flow of the movement of God like seeds in the wind. This is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

The **incarnational impulse** refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

When churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches—expecting people to come to them—they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact. Instead of being sown in the wind, the seeds are put into ecclesial storehouses, effectively extinguishing the purpose they were made for. The attractional model focuses on church growth, which hinders the power of multiplication and makes it impossible to release a movement.

Missional churches understand that the gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, since every generation has its own unique questions. The gospel must constantly be recontextualized to speak to people in their place of address. This requires becoming native to culture, understanding what "good news" means in each specific context, and engaging with deep cross-cultural empathy.

## Key Points

- **Mission is God-centered, not church-centered**: God is a missionary God, and the church participates in God's mission rather than having its own mission.

- **Missional means "sent"**: The church is a sent people, going out into the world rather than expecting the world to come to it.

- **Incarnational means "native"**: The church must become native to its context, embedding the gospel deeply within culture rather than remaining foreign.

- **Twin movements**: Missional (going out) and incarnational (going deep) work together as two dimensions of the same reality.

- **Six practices of incarnation**: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, and Proclamation enable authentic cultural engagement.

- **Contrast with attractional**: Missional churches go to people; attractional churches expect people to come to them.

- **Multiplication over addition**: Missional approaches enable multiplication and movement; attractional approaches focus on addition and growth.

- **Contextualization**: The gospel must be recontextualized for each generation and culture, speaking to people in their place of address.

## Practical Application

To become a missional church, begin by shifting your understanding of mission from church-centered to God-centered. Recognize that God is already at work in your community, and your role is to join what God is doing. This requires learning to see with "soft eyes"—perceiving where God is already active rather than assuming God only works through church programs.

Develop missional practices that involve going out and going deep. Start by identifying the "nooks and crannies" of your community—the places where people gather, the networks where relationships form, the spaces where life happens. Then practice presence: be fully present in those spaces, not as outsiders trying to extract people, but as neighbors participating in community life.

Build proximity by living in and engaging with the culture you're called to reach. This might mean relocating, changing how you spend your time, or intentionally entering spaces you've previously avoided. Practice powerlessness by approaching with humility rather than trying to control or fix. Recognize prevenience—God's work already present—and join it rather than trying to start something new.

Embrace passion in the sense of redemptive suffering—being willing to enter into the pain and brokenness of your context. And finally, practice proclamation: sharing the good news in ways that make sense to your context, speaking the language of the culture while maintaining the integrity of the gospel.

Shift from attractional to missional metrics. Instead of measuring success by how many people come to your building, measure by how many people are being sent out, how many relationships are forming in the community, how the gospel is being embedded in culture. Create structures that support sending rather than just gathering.

## Examples

The early church provides a powerful example of missional church. They had no buildings, no professional leadership, no formal institutions, yet they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries. How? They went to people rather than expecting people to come to them. They became native to their contexts, embedding the gospel in the cultures they encountered. They operated as a sent people, extending the mission of God outward.

The Chinese underground church demonstrates missional church in a contemporary context. Under severe persecution, with no buildings, no central organization, and no mass meetings, they grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years. They couldn't operate attractionally—there was no place to attract people to. Instead, they operated missionally, going to people, embedding the gospel in communities, and multiplying through relationships.

The Celtic missionary movement shows missional church in action. Celtic missionaries didn't build cathedrals and expect people to come. Instead, they went to people, lived among them, learned their language and culture, and embedded the gospel in ways that made sense to each context. They became native rather than remaining foreign.

Contemporary examples include churches that have shifted from attractional to missional approaches. These churches measure success not by Sunday attendance but by how many people are being sent out, how many missional communities are forming, how the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces. They've moved from being a destination to being a sending base.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Missional means doing more outreach"**: No, missional is not about adding outreach activities to an otherwise attractional church. It's a fundamental shift in understanding the church's nature and purpose.

**"Missional and attractional are mutually exclusive"**: While they represent different paradigms, some churches successfully combine both approaches. However, the missional impulse must be primary, not secondary.

**"Missional means abandoning the gathered church"**: Missional churches still gather, but gathering serves the purpose of sending, not the other way around. The church is both gathered and scattered.

**"Missional is just a new word for evangelism"**: Missional is broader than evangelism. It encompasses the whole of the church's participation in God's mission, which includes evangelism but also justice, mercy, and cultural transformation.

**"Missional churches don't care about numbers"**: Missional churches care deeply about multiplication and movement, but they measure differently. They focus on multiplication (disciples making disciples) rather than just addition (attracting people to events).

**"Missional is only for certain contexts"**: While missional approaches are essential in post-Christian contexts, they're actually the biblical norm. The attractional approach worked in Christendom contexts but is increasingly ineffective.

**"Missional means being less committed to truth"**: On the contrary, missional churches are deeply committed to the truth of the gospel. They simply recognize that truth must be contextualized—spoken in ways that make sense to each culture while maintaining integrity.
