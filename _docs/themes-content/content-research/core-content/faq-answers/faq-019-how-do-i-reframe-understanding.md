# How Do I Reframe My Understanding of God and Mission?

## Direct Answer

To reframe your understanding of God and mission, begin by recognizing that we need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The problem is reductionism—the way we have reduced the expansive, mysterious, poetic story of God into narrow, propositional, rationalistic formulas. We have demythologized the biblical narrative (removing its mythic power), demystified our faith (eliminating wonder and mystery), and depoeticized our language (reducing poetic speech to rational code). To reframe, engage in three key movements: **remystifying** (recovering wonder and radical amazement), **repoeticizing** (using language that captures imagination and speaks to the heart), and **remythologizing** (telling the full story of God with all its power and beauty).

Develop "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms rather than just focusing on analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see the whole picture, to recognize the "shards of heaven's kaleidoscope" (the image of God) in every human soul, and to find what God is already doing in culture. Become "detectives of divinity," learning to read culture and people to discover their ultimate longings. Practice "romancing the city"—developing deep, loving relationships with the culture you're called to reach. This requires the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy. Live "in/credible" lives that make others want to say "I'll have what they're having."

## Expanded Explanation

Reframation represents the urgent need to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. The term plays on "Reformation," suggesting that what we need is not merely reform but reframing—a fundamental shift in how we see and understand reality.

The problem is reductionism. We have:
- **Demythologized** the biblical narrative (removing its mythic power)
- **Demystified** our faith (eliminating wonder and mystery)
- **Depoeticized** our language (reducing poetic speech to rational code)

The result is a gospel that has lost its transformative power.

Reframation involves three key movements:

1. **Remystifying**: Recovering wonder and radical amazement. Recognizing that God is mysterious, that faith involves wonder, that there's more to reality than we can fully understand.

2. **Repoeticizing**: Using language that captures imagination and speaks to the heart. Recognizing that truth is not just propositional but also poetic, that it speaks to the whole person, not just the mind.

3. **Remythologizing**: Telling the full story of God with all its power and beauty. Recognizing that the biblical narrative is mythic in the best sense—it's the true story of the world, told with power and beauty.

"Soft eyes" refers to the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms. Soft eyes enable us to see the whole picture, to recognize the image of God in every human soul, and to find what God is already doing in culture.

"Romancing the city" involves developing deep, loving relationships with the culture you're called to reach. This is courtship rather than speed dating—patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work.

## Key Points

- **Three movements**: Remystifying, repoeticizing, remythologizing.

- **Soft eyes**: Ability to perceive deeper patterns and see the whole picture.

- **Detectives of divinity**: Learning to read culture and people to discover their ultimate longings.

- **Romancing the city**: Developing deep, loving relationships with culture.

- **In/credible lives**: Living in ways that make others want what you have.

- **Recovery, not creation**: Recovering the fullness of the gospel, not creating something new.

## Practical Application

Engage in the three movements:
- **Remystify**: Recover wonder. Recognize that God is mysterious. Embrace the mystery of faith.
- **Repoeticize**: Use language that captures imagination. Speak to the heart, not just the mind.
- **Remythologize**: Tell the full story of God with power and beauty.

Develop soft eyes. Practice perceiving deeper patterns. See the whole picture, not just analytical details.

Become detectives of divinity. Learn to read culture and people. Discover their ultimate longings.

Practice romancing the city. Develop deep, loving relationships with culture. Be patient, attentive, empathetic.

Live in/credible lives. Make others want to say "I'll have what they're having."
