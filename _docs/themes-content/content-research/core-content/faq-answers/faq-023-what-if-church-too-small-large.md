# What If My Church Is Too Small/Large for This?

## Direct Answer

Movement DNA (mDNA) works at any size. The evidence from history shows mDNA working in contexts ranging from small house churches to large movements. The early church started small—as few as 25,000 Christians in AD 100—yet grew to 20 million. The Chinese underground church operated in small, scattered communities yet grew to 120 million. The Methodist movement included both small class meetings and large societies. Size is not the issue; the presence and activation of all six mDNA elements is what matters.

For small churches, mDNA is actually more accessible because you can embed all six elements more easily. Small churches can activate APEST throughout the Body more readily, create communitas more naturally, and build organic systems more simply. For large churches, the challenge is maintaining movemental energy even as you create necessary structures—being organized but not institutionalized. Large churches can transition to movements by combining resources and reach with dynamism and reproduction capacity. The key is not size but whether all six elements of mDNA are present and working together. Whether your church is small or large, the task is the same: embed all six elements and create conditions where Apostolic Genius can emerge.

## Expanded Explanation

Size is not a barrier to movement. The evidence from history shows mDNA working in contexts of all sizes:

- **Small contexts**: The early church started small. House churches operated with all six elements. Small groups can activate mDNA.

- **Large contexts**: The Methodist movement included large societies. Large churches can transition to movements.

- **Mixed contexts**: Movements often include both small and large expressions working together.

For small churches, mDNA is actually more accessible:
- Easier to embed all six elements
- Can activate APEST throughout the Body more readily
- Can create communitas more naturally
- Can build organic systems more simply

For large churches, the challenge is different:
- Maintaining movemental energy even as structures are created
- Being organized but not institutionalized
- Combining resources and reach with dynamism
- Transitioning from institution to movement

The key is not size but whether all six elements are present and working together. Whether your church is small or large, the task is the same: embed all six elements and create conditions where Apostolic Genius can emerge.

## Key Points

- **Works at any size**: mDNA works in contexts of all sizes.

- **Small churches**: mDNA is actually more accessible in small contexts.

- **Large churches**: Can transition to movements by maintaining movemental energy.

- **Not about size**: The key is whether all six elements are present and working together.

## Practical Application

Don't let size be an excuse. Whether your church is small or large, focus on embedding all six mDNA elements.

For small churches, recognize the advantages. You can embed elements more easily. Use that to your advantage.

For large churches, focus on maintaining movemental energy. Be organized but not institutionalized.

Work on all six elements regardless of size. The task is the same.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"mDNA only works in small churches"**: No, mDNA works at any size.

**"mDNA only works in large churches"**: No, mDNA actually may be more accessible in small contexts.

**"Size matters"**: Size is not the issue. The presence of all six elements is what matters.
