# How Do I Know If Movement DNA Is Activating?

## Direct Answer

You know movement DNA (mDNA) is activating when you see signs of movement rather than just organization. Look for multiplication rather than just addition—disciples making disciples, communities reproducing, the gospel spreading through relationships. Look for distributed leadership—intelligence throughout the system rather than concentrated at the top. Look for organic growth—the church operating like a living organism rather than a machine. Look for communitas—deep togetherness formed through shared mission and adventure. Look for missional engagement—people being sent out and the gospel being embedded in culture. Look for APEST activation—all five functions operating throughout the Body. Look for reproduction—new expressions of church emerging, not just growth in existing ones.

The key indicators are systemic: all six elements working together creates something greater than the sum of parts. You'll see Apostolic Genius emerging—that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that transforms communities. You'll see "movementum"—unstoppable momentum that builds through consistent effort over time. You'll see exponential rather than linear growth. You'll see the church functioning as a movement rather than just an organization. Remember that activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds gradually. Don't expect immediate results, but look for consistent patterns of movement over time.

## Expanded Explanation

Signs of mDNA activation include:

**Multiplication**: Disciples making disciples, communities reproducing, the gospel spreading through relationships. This is different from just adding people to existing structures.

**Distributed leadership**: Intelligence throughout the system rather than concentrated at the top. People are being released to function in their gifting.

**Organic growth**: The church operating like a living organism rather than a machine. Systems are self-organizing, adaptive, and reproducible.

**Communitas**: Deep togetherness formed through shared mission and adventure. Not just comfortable community but transformative togetherness.

**Missional engagement**: People being sent out and the gospel being embedded in culture. The church is going to people rather than just expecting them to come.

**APEST activation**: All five functions operating throughout the Body. Not just Shepherd and Teacher but also Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist.

**Reproduction**: New expressions of church emerging, not just growth in existing ones. The movement is multiplying, not just adding.

**Apostolic Genius emerging**: That mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy that transforms communities. Something greater than the sum of parts.

**Movementum**: Unstoppable momentum that builds through consistent effort over time. Like a flywheel gaining speed.

**Exponential growth**: Growth that multiplies rather than just adds. The movement is spreading like a virus.

## Key Points

- **Multiplication**: Look for disciples making disciples, communities reproducing.

- **Distributed leadership**: Intelligence throughout the system.

- **Organic growth**: Operating like a living organism.

- **Communitas**: Deep togetherness through shared mission.

- **Missional engagement**: People being sent out.

- **APEST activation**: All five functions operating.

- **Reproduction**: New expressions emerging.

- **Apostolic Genius**: Movemental energy emerging.

- **Patience**: Activation takes time. Look for consistent patterns.

## Practical Application

Look for signs of multiplication. Are disciples making disciples? Are communities reproducing?

Look for distributed leadership. Is intelligence throughout the system? Are people being released?

Look for organic growth. Is the church operating like an organism? Are systems self-organizing?

Look for communitas. Is there deep togetherness through shared mission?

Look for missional engagement. Are people being sent out? Is the gospel being embedded?

Look for APEST activation. Are all five functions operating?

Look for reproduction. Are new expressions emerging?

Be patient. Activation takes time. Look for consistent patterns over time.

## Examples

The early church shows mDNA activating. They multiplied through relationships, had distributed leadership, operated organically, formed communitas, engaged missionally, activated APEST, and reproduced new expressions.

Contemporary movements show similar patterns. They multiply, have distributed leadership, operate organically, form communitas, engage missionally, activate APEST, and reproduce.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Activation happens quickly"**: No, activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds gradually.

**"Activation is obvious"**: Sometimes activation is subtle. Look for consistent patterns over time.

**"Activation means no problems"**: Activation doesn't eliminate challenges. It creates movemental capacity to address them.
