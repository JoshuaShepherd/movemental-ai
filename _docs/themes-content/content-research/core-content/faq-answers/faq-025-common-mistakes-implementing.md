# What Are Common Mistakes in Implementing Frameworks?

## Direct Answer

Common mistakes in implementing frameworks include: trying to implement frameworks as programs rather than systemic change, focusing on just a few elements rather than all six of mDNA, expecting quick results rather than being patient, trying to create something new rather than recovering what's been forgotten, focusing on structure only rather than paradigm-platform-practices, trying to engineer activation through human effort alone rather than relying on the Holy Spirit, overcomplicating rather than distilling to essence, and measuring the wrong things (attendance rather than sending, addition rather than multiplication).

The most common mistake is treating frameworks as programs to be added rather than systems to be recovered and activated. Another common mistake is focusing on just one or two elements of mDNA rather than all six. Remember that mDNA is systemic—all six elements are necessary. Missing even one prevents activation. Another mistake is expecting immediate results. Activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Don't give up too soon. Another mistake is trying to engineer everything through human effort. Activation requires the work of the Holy Spirit. Pray, discern, and trust.

## Expanded Explanation

Common mistakes include:

1. **Treating frameworks as programs**: Trying to add frameworks as programs rather than engaging in systemic change. Frameworks require shifting paradigm, platform, and practices—all three levels.

2. **Focusing on partial elements**: Trying to implement just one or two elements of mDNA rather than all six. Remember that mDNA is systemic—all six are necessary.

3. **Expecting quick results**: Not being patient. Activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds gradually.

4. **Trying to create rather than recover**: Thinking you need to create something new rather than recovering what's been forgotten. mDNA is latent in every church.

5. **Focusing on structure only**: Trying to change structure without changing paradigm and practices. All three levels must be aligned.

6. **Trying to engineer everything**: Relying on human effort alone rather than the Holy Spirit. Activation requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit.

7. **Overcomplicating**: Making things more complex than they need to be. Movements thrive when message and structure are simple enough to reproduce.

8. **Measuring wrong things**: Focusing on attendance rather than sending, addition rather than multiplication, programs rather than practices.

9. **Giving up too soon**: Not being persistent. Change takes time. Don't give up.

10. **Not engaging the whole system**: Trying to change one part without engaging the whole. mDNA is systemic.

## Key Points

- **Not programs**: Frameworks require systemic change, not just adding programs.

- **All six elements**: Focus on all six elements of mDNA, not just one or two.

- **Patience required**: Activation takes time. Don't expect quick results.

- **Recovery, not creation**: Recover what's been forgotten, don't try to create something new.

- **Three levels**: Engage paradigm, platform, and practices—all three.

- **Holy Spirit**: Rely on the Holy Spirit, not just human effort.

- **Simplicity**: Distill to essence. Don't overcomplicate.

- **Right metrics**: Measure sending and multiplication, not just attendance.

## Practical Application

Avoid treating frameworks as programs. Engage in systemic change at all three levels.

Focus on all six elements. Don't pick and choose. All are necessary.

Be patient. Activation takes time. Don't expect immediate results.

Recover, don't create. mDNA is latent. Recover what's been forgotten.

Engage all three levels. Paradigm, platform, and practices must be aligned.

Rely on the Holy Spirit. Pray, discern, and trust.

Keep it simple. Distill to essence. Don't overcomplicate.

Measure the right things. Focus on sending and multiplication.

## Examples

Churches that make these mistakes often struggle. They add programs but don't see movement. They focus on one element but miss others. They expect quick results and give up too soon.

Churches that avoid these mistakes show different patterns. They engage in systemic change, focus on all six elements, are patient, recover what's been forgotten, engage all three levels, rely on the Holy Spirit, keep it simple, and measure the right things.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Frameworks are programs"**: No, frameworks require systemic change, not just adding programs.

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: No, all six are necessary. The system won't activate if any element is missing.

**"Activation is quick"**: No, activation takes time. Be patient.
