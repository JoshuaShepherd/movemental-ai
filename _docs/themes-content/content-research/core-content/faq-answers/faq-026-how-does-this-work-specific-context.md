# How Does This Work in [Specific Context]?

## Direct Answer

Movement DNA (mDNA) works in any context because it's not culturally bound but represents something inherent to the church's design. The evidence from history shows mDNA working across vastly different cultures, times, and circumstances: the early church in the Roman Empire, the Chinese underground church under persecution, the Celtic missions in Europe, the Moravians in various contexts, the Methodists in England, and contemporary movements around the world. While the specific expression of mDNA will vary by context, the six elements remain constant: Jesus is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas.

The key is contextualization—adapting the expression of mDNA to your specific context while maintaining the core elements. This requires understanding your context deeply (romancing the city), developing "soft eyes" to see what God is already doing, and becoming native to your context rather than remaining foreign. The missional-incarnational impulse specifically calls for this: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational), embedding the gospel in culture in ways that make sense to that context. Whether you're in an urban, suburban, rural, post-Christian, or other context, the task is the same: embed all six elements and adapt their expression to your specific situation.

## Expanded Explanation

mDNA works in any context because it's not culturally bound. The evidence shows mDNA working in:
- Urban contexts
- Suburban contexts
- Rural contexts
- Post-Christian contexts
- Christian contexts
- Persecuted contexts
- Free contexts
- Western contexts
- Non-Western contexts

While the specific expression varies, the six elements remain constant. The key is contextualization—adapting expression while maintaining core elements.

This requires:
- Understanding your context deeply
- Developing soft eyes to see what God is doing
- Becoming native to your context
- Embedding the gospel in ways that make sense

The missional-incarnational impulse specifically calls for this contextualization. You must become native to your context rather than remaining foreign.

## Key Points

- **Works in any context**: mDNA is not culturally bound.

- **Core elements constant**: Six elements remain the same.

- **Expression varies**: How elements are expressed adapts to context.

- **Contextualization needed**: Adapt expression while maintaining core.

- **Become native**: Become native to your context rather than remaining foreign.

## Practical Application

Understand your context deeply. Develop soft eyes. See what God is already doing.

Become native to your context. Don't remain foreign. Embed the gospel in ways that make sense.

Adapt the expression of mDNA to your context while maintaining the core elements.

Work on all six elements regardless of context. The task is the same.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"mDNA only works in certain contexts"**: No, mDNA works in any context.

**"We need to change the elements"**: No, adapt the expression, not the elements.
