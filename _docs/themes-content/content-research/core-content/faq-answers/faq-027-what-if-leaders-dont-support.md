# What If Leaders Don't Support This?

## Direct Answer

If leaders don't support movement DNA (mDNA) activation, recognize that this is a common challenge. Resistance often comes from those with vested interests in the current system—those receiving salary, status, and kudos from maintaining the status quo. We know from history that resistance to change does not come from the ignorant masses but rather from the "professionals" who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. However, you don't need everyone on board to begin. According to Diffusion of Innovation theory, you only need 10-16% of innovators and early adopters for change to be inevitable in a system. Build a coalition of the willing—focus on those who are ready for change.

If you're not in a leadership position, start where you are. You can embed mDNA in your sphere of influence. Activate APEST in your context. Develop missional practices. Create communitas with those around you. Model what movement looks like. If you are in leadership, engage in metanoia—help leaders see the need for change through the downcurve of the journey. Create liminal experiences that help them see the need. Tell alternate stories. Be patient and persistent. Recognize that this is not just a human battle but a spiritual one. Pray, discern, and rely on the Holy Spirit. Sometimes change requires new leadership. Sometimes it requires waiting. Sometimes it requires starting new expressions.
