# How Do I Measure Progress?

## Direct Answer

To measure progress in movement DNA (mDNA) activation, shift from attractional metrics to missional metrics. Instead of measuring success by Sunday attendance, measure by how many people are being sent out, how many missional communities are forming, how the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces, and how relationships are forming in the community. Measure multiplication rather than just addition—disciples making disciples, communities reproducing, the gospel spreading through relationships. Measure movement indicators: distributed leadership, organic growth, communitas formation, APEST activation, and reproduction of new expressions.

Use the mDNA framework as a diagnostic tool. Assess which elements are present and functioning, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Look for signs of Apostolic Genius emerging—that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy. Look for "movementum"—unstoppable momentum building over time. Look for exponential rather than linear growth. Remember that progress is not just about numbers but about transformation. Are people becoming more like Jesus? Is the church functioning more like a movement? Are communities being transformed? Be patient—activation takes time. Look for consistent patterns over time rather than immediate results. Trust the process and trust the Holy Spirit.

## Expanded Explanation

Shift metrics from:
- Attendance → Sending
- Addition → Multiplication
- Programs → Practices
- Gathering → Scattering
- Growth → Reproduction

Measure:
- How many people are being sent out
- How many missional communities are forming
- How the gospel is being embedded
- How relationships are forming
- Disciples making disciples
- Communities reproducing
- Distributed leadership
- Organic growth
- Communitas formation
- APEST activation
- Reproduction of new expressions

Use mDNA framework to assess:
- Which elements are present
- Which are missing
- Which are suppressed

Look for:
- Apostolic Genius emerging
- Movementum building
- Exponential growth
- Transformation happening

## Key Points

- **Shift metrics**: From attractional to missional metrics.

- **Multiplication over addition**: Measure multiplication, not just addition.

- **Movement indicators**: Look for signs of movement.

- **mDNA assessment**: Use framework to assess elements.

- **Transformation focus**: Progress is about transformation, not just numbers.

- **Patience required**: Look for consistent patterns over time.

## Practical Application

Shift your metrics. Measure sending and multiplication rather than just attendance.

Use mDNA framework to assess. Which elements are present? Which are missing?

Look for movement indicators. Signs of Apostolic Genius? Movementum? Exponential growth?

Focus on transformation. Are people becoming more like Jesus? Is the church functioning more like a movement?

Be patient. Look for consistent patterns over time.

## Examples

Churches that measure missional metrics show different patterns. They focus on sending, multiplication, and transformation rather than just attendance.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Numbers don't matter"**: Numbers matter, but which numbers matter is the question. Measure the right things.

**"We can't measure movement"**: You can measure movement indicators. Look for signs of Apostolic Genius and movementum.
