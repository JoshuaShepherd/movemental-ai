# Framework Integration: Frameworks for Different Contexts

## Integration Overview

Different contexts require different approaches to framework integration. A church plant needs a different sequence than a large established church. A small group needs different emphasis than a denomination. This integration guide shows how to adapt framework integration for different contexts.

The key principle is that all frameworks are necessary, but the sequence, emphasis, and application will vary by context. Understanding your context and adapting accordingly is essential for effective implementation.

## Context Categories

### 1. Church Plants and New Starts

**Primary Frameworks**: mDNA, APEST/5Q, Disciplism, Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Sequence**:
1. **Start with mDNA**: Establish all six elements from the beginning
2. **Develop APEST culture**: Create fivefold ministry environment early
3. **Embed Disciplism**: Make discipleship the core from day one
4. **Practice Missional-Incarnational**: Go out and go deep from the start
5. **Build Organic Systems**: Design for movement from the beginning

**Key Principles**:
- Begin with the end in mind (movement, not just church)
- Build DNA in from the start
- Design for reproduction from day one
- Avoid institutional patterns
- Create simple, reproducible structures

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Starting with programs instead of DNA
- Building institutional structures
- Focusing on addition rather than multiplication
- Ignoring APEST from the beginning
- Not requiring discipleship from the start

### 2. Established Churches (Small to Medium)

**Primary Frameworks**: Metanoia Journey, Paradigm-Platform-Practices, mDNA, APEST/5Q

**Sequence**:
1. **Begin Metanoia Journey**: Create movemental thinking
2. **Work through Paradigm-Platform-Practices**: Transform at all three levels
3. **Activate mDNA**: Ensure all six elements are present
4. **Develop APEST culture**: Create fivefold ministry environment
5. **Integrate Movement Dynamics**: Enable multiplication

**Key Principles**:
- Transformation must precede multiplication
- Work through the U-curve intentionally
- Address all three layers (mind, soul, will)
- Don't skip stages
- Create movemental capacity before multiplying

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Trying to multiply before transforming
- Skipping Metanoia Journey stages
- Not addressing all three layers
- Rushing the process
- Maintaining institutional thinking

### 3. Large Churches and Megachurches

**Primary Frameworks**: Metanoia Journey, On the Verge Process, Movement Dynamics, mDNA, APEST/5Q

**Sequence**:
1. **Imagine**: Create movemental vision
2. **Shift**: Work through Paradigm-Platform-Practices
3. **Innovate**: Create new movemental expressions
4. **Movementum**: Build momentum for movement
5. **Activate mDNA**: Ensure all elements present
6. **Develop APEST**: Create fivefold environment
7. **Enable Movement Dynamics**: Scale and multiply

**Key Principles**:
- Large scale requires intentional process
- Transformation takes time
- Multiple expressions needed
- Maintain DNA while adapting
- Create movemental capacity throughout

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Rushing transformation
- Not maintaining DNA
- Creating programs instead of movements
- Ignoring APEST
- Not enabling multiplication

### 4. Networks and Denominations

**Primary Frameworks**: Movement Dynamics, Organic Systems, mDNA, APEST/5Q

**Sequence**:
1. **Clarify DNA**: Establish core identity
2. **Create Network Structures**: Enable distributed organization
3. **Develop APEST**: Create fivefold environment
4. **Enable Movement Dynamics**: Scale and multiply
5. **Maintain Organic Systems**: Keep structures movemental

**Key Principles**:
- DNA must be clear and replicable
- Network structures enable multiplication
- Simple rules guide behavior
- Distributed intelligence throughout
- Maintain identity while adapting

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Unclear DNA
- Centralized control
- Complex systems
- Institutional thinking
- Missing APEST

### 5. Small Groups and Missional Communities

**Primary Frameworks**: Disciplism, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST/5Q, mDNA

**Sequence**:
1. **Practice Disciplism**: Make discipleship core
2. **Engage Missional-Incarnational**: Go out and go deep
3. **Activate APEST**: Recognize and use fivefold gifts
4. **Embed mDNA**: Ensure all elements present
5. **Enable Reproduction**: Design for multiplication

**Key Principles**:
- Discipleship is core, not optional
- Mission happens in context
- All five functions needed
- Simple, reproducible patterns
- Design for multiplication

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Making discipleship optional
- Staying attractional
- Ignoring APEST
- Complex structures
- Not designing for reproduction

### 6. Leadership Development

**Primary Frameworks**: APEST/5Q, Disciplism, Metanoia Journey, mDNA

**Sequence**:
1. **Discover APEST**: Identify and develop fivefold gifts
2. **Practice Disciplism**: Model disciple-making
3. **Traverse Metanoia**: Create movemental thinking
4. **Understand mDNA**: Learn systemic context
5. **Enable Others**: Activate frameworks in others

**Key Principles**:
- Leadership requires all five functions
- Discipleship is core to leadership
- Movemental thinking essential
- Systemic understanding needed
- Leaders enable others

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Focusing on one function only
- Separating leadership from discipleship
- Institutional thinking
- Missing systemic context
- Not enabling others

## Adaptive Principles

### Context Assessment

**Questions to Ask**:
- What is our current context? (plant, established, large, network, etc.)
- What is our current state? (institutional, transitional, movemental)
- What are our resources? (people, finances, time)
- What are our constraints? (denominational, cultural, etc.)
- What is our vision? (where do we want to go?)

### Framework Selection

**All Frameworks Necessary, But**:
- Different contexts need different sequences
- Different contexts need different emphasis
- Different contexts need different applications
- All frameworks eventually needed
- Integration is the goal

### Implementation Adaptation

**Adapt While Maintaining Integrity**:
- Maintain core principles
- Adapt application methods
- Adjust sequence as needed
- Emphasize what's most needed
- Don't skip essential frameworks

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Start → Movement
**Frameworks**: mDNA → APEST → Disciplism → Missional-Incarnational → Organic Systems → Movement Dynamics

### Pattern 2: Established → Movement
**Frameworks**: Metanoia Journey → Paradigm-Platform-Practices → mDNA → APEST → Movement Dynamics

### Pattern 3: Large → Movement
**Frameworks**: Imagine → Shift → Innovate → Movementum → mDNA → APEST → Movement Dynamics

### Pattern 4: Network → Movement
**Frameworks**: DNA Clarity → Network Structures → APEST → Movement Dynamics → Organic Systems

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess framework integration for your context:

1. **Evaluate context**: What is your current context and state?

2. **Assess frameworks**: Which frameworks are present and operational?

3. **Check sequence**: Is the sequence appropriate for your context?

4. **Examine emphasis**: Is the emphasis right for your context?

5. **Look for adaptation**: Are frameworks adapted appropriately?

6. **Assess integration**: Are frameworks working together?

Key questions:
- What is our current context and state?
- Which frameworks are present and operational?
- Is the sequence appropriate for our context?
- Is the emphasis right for our context?
- Are frameworks adapted appropriately?
- Are frameworks working together?

## Implementation Pathways

To adapt framework integration for your context:

1. **Assess context**: Understand your current context and state.

2. **Select frameworks**: Determine which frameworks are most needed now.

3. **Determine sequence**: Establish the right sequence for your context.

4. **Set emphasis**: Decide what to emphasize first.

5. **Adapt application**: Adapt how frameworks are applied to your context.

6. **Maintain integrity**: Keep core principles while adapting methods.

7. **Integrate gradually**: Add frameworks as capacity grows.

Sequence and priorities:
- Assessment: Understand context and state
- Selection: Determine needed frameworks
- Sequence: Establish right order
- Emphasis: Decide priorities
- Adaptation: Adapt to context
- Integrity: Maintain principles
- Integration: Add frameworks gradually

## Case Studies and Examples

**Church Plant**: Started with mDNA, developed APEST culture, embedded Disciplism, practiced Missional-Incarnational, built Organic Systems, enabled Movement Dynamics.

**Established Church**: Began Metanoia Journey, worked through Paradigm-Platform-Practices, activated mDNA, developed APEST, integrated Movement Dynamics.

**Large Church**: Used On the Verge process (Imagine, Shift, Innovate, Movementum), activated mDNA, developed APEST, enabled Movement Dynamics.

**Network**: Clarified DNA, created network structures, developed APEST, enabled Movement Dynamics, maintained Organic Systems.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong sequence for context**: Using new start sequence for established church.

2. **Missing frameworks**: Not having all frameworks eventually.

3. **Lack of adaptation**: Using same approach for all contexts.

4. **Skipping stages**: Not completing necessary stages.

5. **Wrong emphasis**: Emphasizing wrong frameworks for context.

6. **Lack of integration**: Having frameworks but not integrating.
