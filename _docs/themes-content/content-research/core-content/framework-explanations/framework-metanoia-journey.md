# The Metanoia Journey: U-Shaped Transformation Process

## Framework Overview

The Metanoia Journey is a practical process for facilitating deep, spiritual, organizational transformation. It follows a U-shaped curve that involves both unlearning (the downcurve) and relearning (the upcurve). This journey recognizes that transformation requires going through the valley, not around it—there is no shortcut to maturity.

Metanoia is the Greek word usually translated as "repentance" in English, but it carries far richer meaning. Metanoia means a radical change of mind, an expanded reframing of reality, a paradigm shift that transforms how we see and understand everything. It involves breakthrough moments that transform perception, enabling us to see the world through fresh eyes and experience ongoing conversion.

The Metanoia Journey follows the pattern of the hero's journey identified by Joseph Campbell—the quest, ordeal, and return that characterizes transformative experiences. Jesus' own life followed this pattern: incarnation (descent), ministry and passion (ordeal), resurrection and ascension (ascent). Metanoia enables us to participate in this pattern, bringing us in sync with the mind of Christ.

This journey is essential for both personal discipleship and organizational transformation. Any advance in knowledge of God requires it. Any meaningful change in the church demands it. Metanoia is not a one-time event but an ongoing journey, a process that must be repeated as new challenges arise and as we grow in understanding.

## Component Parts

### The Downcurve (To Un/learn)

The downcurve consists of four stages that involve unlearning and deconstruction:

#### 1. Unravel
The journey to change begins with facing head-on what design thinkers call a "wicked problem." Wicked problems are organizational dilemmas that are extremely difficult to solve because of their complex and interconnected nature. They are often not immediately obvious, but even when they are, the potential solutions are not risk-free.

At the Unraveling stage, it is critical to become aware of the anomalies inherent in the prevailing paradigm of the organization. To unravel means to become conscious of ourselves, to become aware of the obsolete thinking and redundant practices. The crisis forces us to investigate the contours of the predominant mental map—the map that is producing the problems we are now facing.

#### 2. Uncover
This stage follows closely that of Unraveling. Having faced (and named) the wicked problem, this next stage initiates a quest to both solve the problem and create new possibilities. This quest must be undertaken with "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms rather than just focusing on analytical details.

A critical aspect of becoming self-aware starts with the recognition that all is not well with the status quo. There are serious threats not just from the changing cultural context but also from within the system itself. An anomaly is that "splinter in the mind" that tells us something is missing or wrong.

We engage soft eyes to see what God the Designer wants to say, to sense the Spirit's correcting voice, to understand the nature of our particular mission, calling, and design. We try to identify the ways in which we have drifted from God's original intent. We aim to uncover the meta-ideas—those foundational concepts on which subsequent thinking is built.

#### 3. Unlock
As we have noted, this journey involves something of a spiritual quest for a holy grail of peak performance and transformational impact. Because it is a profoundly explorative process, we must ourselves become intrepid trailblazers in search of new frontiers, charting the way forward for others to follow.

In this Unlock stage, we will also need to start exploring new frontiers, comparing notes with other agencies facing similar challenges, and cultivating a culture open to learning new ways. This will also involve prayer-filled exploration and the spiritual receptivity that is characteristic of children in the mode of approach play.

Use childlike imagination to explore alternative ways of doing things. Think like a beginner rather than an expert. Deliberately put yourself out of your comfort zone. Think like a hacker—try to figure out the frailties in the system and crack the code.

#### 4. Understand
Here, towards the bottom of the downcurve, we should have gained sufficient (collective) self-awareness—through assessing the flaws in our system and by exploring possible solutions to the wicked problem—to be able to name some viable alternatives to our inherited ways of thinking and acting.

Although we won't yet have formulated a coherent mental map that fully interprets our situation, we ought to be aware of some of the broad frameworks of a new paradigm, and sense the promise of movement, along with some pointers to viable ways forward.

### The Turning Point (The Moment of Insight)

Here we arrive at the bottom of the U-shaped curve. By this point, we have engaged with a huge amount of un/learning; we have become aware of the frailties in our current way of doing things; we have sought to examine our systems to see what hinders and what helps; and we have also looked at alternative ways of fulfilling our unique calling.

This is the point of nakedness and openness to God, but this is precisely the place where God can impact us in a new way. The bottom of the curve is powerful because it is where God meets us … in the valley. This is that point in the hero's journey—the abyss—where insight into how to resolve the wicked problem is finally given.

This is the moment of revelation, and where we receive the elegant solution that makes complete sense. This is what we call "rectitude" or "fittingness"—the intuition that "this just feels so right" that you know it is from God.

### The Upcurve (To Re/learn)

The upcurve involves three stages that involve relearning and reconstruction:

#### 1. Paradigm
Paradigm is the organizational mind—the identity, story, and defining ideas that shape how an organization understands itself and its purpose. Paradigms consist of mental maps (meta-ideas, beliefs, competencies) and organizational DNA (genetics that replicate throughout the system).

Paradigm shift requires:
- Leadership unity
- Apostolic imagination
- Perseverance
- Telling alternate stories
- Letting things die
- Seeing reality clearly

The paradigm corresponds to the mind dimension of the heart. It is the seed, which contains the potential for the whole forest.

#### 2. Platform
Platform is the organizational soul—the culture and structures that shape collective behavior. Culture components include theological distinctives, core values, shared vocabulary, heroes, celebration of behavior, and branding. Movemental structures include relational structures (how people connect), resource structures (how resources flow), and measurement structures (what gets measured and rewarded).

Platforms architect organizational behavior through the path of least resistance. The platform corresponds to the soul dimension of the heart. It is the tree, which contains the potential for the forest.

#### 3. Practices
Practices are the organizational will—the observable, repeatable behaviors that embody values and create culture. Practices move from core values to core behaviors, develop movemental rhythms and algorithms, and create tools (physical, training, communication) that fractalize DNA throughout the organization.

Practices make transformation tangible and embodied, creating habits and muscle memory that enable ongoing learning and refinement. The practices correspond to the will dimension of the heart. They are the forest, which demonstrates the potential of the seed.

## System Dynamics

The Metanoia Journey works as an integrated system where:

1. **The downcurve prepares for the upcurve**: Without the unlearning of the downcurve, the relearning of the upcurve will be superficial. The downcurve creates space for new learning.

2. **The turning point is essential**: The moment of insight at the bottom of the curve is where God meets us and where breakthrough occurs. This cannot be rushed or bypassed.

3. **The upcurve builds on the downcurve**: The paradigm, platform, and practices of the upcurve are informed by the unlearning gained through the downcurve.

4. **All three upcurve stages must align**: Paradigm, platform, and practices must be aligned for transformation to take root and endure. You cannot change practices without changing culture (platform), and you cannot change culture without changing thinking (paradigm).

5. **The journey is iterative**: This is not a one-time process but must be repeated as new challenges arise. The journey to one peak prepares for the journey to the next.

6. **Wholehearted engagement is required**: The journey requires the integration of mind, soul, and will—the whole person and the whole organization.

## Activation Principles

The Metanoia Journey activates when:

1. **A wicked problem is faced**: There must be a genuine crisis or challenge that cannot be solved with existing approaches.

2. **Leadership is committed**: Leaders must be willing to go through the difficult process, not just around it.

3. **There is spiritual receptivity**: The journey requires openness to God, prayer, and reliance on the Holy Spirit.

4. **The organization is willing to unlearn**: There must be willingness to let go of old ways of thinking and acting.

5. **There is patience for the process**: The journey takes time and cannot be rushed.

What blocks activation:
- Trying to jump the chasm (avoiding the downcurve)
- Looking for quick fixes rather than deep change
- Unwillingness to face the wicked problem
- Leadership insecurity that prevents honest assessment
- Institutional resistance to change
- Lack of spiritual receptivity
- Impatience with the process

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess readiness for and progress in the Metanoia Journey:

1. **Identify the wicked problem**: Clearly name the adaptive challenge facing the organization.

2. **Assess current paradigm**: Evaluate the prevailing mental model and its limitations.

3. **Evaluate downcurve progress**: Determine which stage of unlearning has been reached.

4. **Check for turning point**: Assess whether breakthrough insight has been received.

5. **Evaluate upcurve alignment**: Determine whether paradigm, platform, and practices are aligned.

Key questions:
- What is the wicked problem we are facing?
- What anomalies have we uncovered in our current system?
- Have we reached the turning point of insight?
- Is our paradigm clearly articulated?
- Are our platform (culture and structures) aligned with our paradigm?
- Do our practices embody our values and paradigm?

## Implementation Pathways

To guide an organization through the Metanoia Journey:

1. **Begin with assessment**: Honestly evaluate the current state and identify the wicked problem.

2. **Engage the downcurve**: Don't rush through unlearning. Take time for each stage:
   - Unravel: Face the crisis
   - Uncover: Use soft eyes to see system flaws
   - Unlock: Explore new frontiers
   - Understand: Gain clarity on alternatives

3. **Wait for the turning point**: Don't force insight. Create space for God to speak.

4. **Build the upcurve systematically**:
   - First, articulate the new paradigm
   - Then, build the platform (culture and structures)
   - Finally, develop practices that embody the paradigm

5. **Ensure alignment**: Make sure paradigm, platform, and practices work together.

6. **Repeat as needed**: Recognize that this is an ongoing journey, not a one-time event.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Face the wicked problem honestly
- Downcurve: Complete the unlearning process
- Turning point: Receive insight from God
- Upcurve: Build paradigm, then platform, then practices
- Alignment: Ensure all three upcurve stages work together
- Iteration: Repeat the journey as new challenges arise

## Case Studies and Examples

**MLC Movement Lab**: The Metanoia Journey has been built into all MLC leadership development training, including Movement Labs, the Starfish and the Spirit Accelerator, the mDNA Accelerator, The City Movement platforms, and the 5Q Church Planting Cohort.

**New Thing Network**: The Metanoia Journey has been embedded into processes of various movements, including New Thing, which has used it to guide churches through transformation.

**The Salvation Army**: Has incorporated the Metanoia Journey into their organizational transformation processes.

**For Charlotte Network**: Has used the Metanoia Journey to guide citywide network transformation.

**Redeemer City to City**: Has integrated the Metanoia Journey into their church planting and multiplication processes.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Trying to jump the chasm**: Attempting to skip the downcurve and go straight to solutions.

2. **Rushing the process**: Not allowing adequate time for unlearning and relearning.

3. **Ignoring the turning point**: Not creating space for God to provide insight.

4. **Misalignment**: Building practices without changing culture, or changing culture without changing thinking.

5. **One-time thinking**: Treating metanoia as a one-time event rather than an ongoing journey.

6. **Surface-level change**: Making cosmetic changes without addressing the underlying paradigm.

7. **Leadership division**: Having disunified leadership that cannot guide the journey together.

8. **Lack of spiritual receptivity**: Trying to engineer transformation through human effort alone.

## Evolution and Development

The Metanoia Journey was developed by Rich Robinson and Alan Hirsch as part of their work in MLC (Movement Leadership Collective). The process has been:

- Built into all MLC leadership development training
- Embedded into many movement processes
- Refined through application in diverse contexts
- Documented in *Metanoia* (2022, with Rob Kelly)
- Integrated with other frameworks (mDNA, APEST, Paradigm-Platform-Practices)

The understanding continues to evolve as the journey is applied in new contexts and as organizations learn from both successes and failures.
