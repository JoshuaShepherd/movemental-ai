# Missional-Incarnational Impulse: The Twin Movements Framework

## Framework Overview

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

This framework recognizes that authentic mission requires both movement—the outward thrust that sends the gospel into new contexts—and incarnation—the deep identification with culture that makes the gospel native to each place. You cannot have one without the other. Missional without incarnational becomes colonial imposition. Incarnational without missional becomes cultural accommodation. Together, they create the dynamic that enables transformative engagement.

The missional-incarnational impulse is one of the six essential elements of mDNA (Movement DNA). It is one of the most easily suppressed elements, often replaced by what is called the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern. This pattern, while effective in certain contexts, blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers.

## Component Parts

### The Missional Impulse (Going Out)

The missional impulse refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Sending rather than attractional**: We go to them rather than expecting them to come to us
- **Outward movement**: Like seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts
- **The sneeze that cannot be suppressed**: The outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission
- **Rooted in missio Dei**: Based on God's sending nature, not human strategy

**Theological Foundation:**
- God sends the Son (John 3:16)
- The Son sends the Spirit (John 15:26)
- Jesus sends his disciples (John 20:21)
- The church is sent into the world (Matthew 28:19-20)

**Visual Representation:**
The missional impulse can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts. It is the sneeze that cannot be suppressed, the outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission.

### The Incarnational Impulse (Going Deep)

The incarnational impulse refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Full identification with culture**: Becoming native rather than foreign
- **Contextualization**: The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation
- **Cultural engagement**: Taking culture seriously, as God did in the incarnation
- **Becoming good news in flesh and blood**: Not just word, but embodied presence

**The Six Practices of Incarnational Mission:**
1. **Presence**: Full identification with culture
2. **Proximity**: Geographic and relational closeness
3. **Powerlessness**: Humility and vulnerability
4. **Prevenience**: Recognizing God's work already present
5. **Passion**: Embracing redemptive suffering
6. **Proclamation**: Sharing the good news

### The Four Movements Framework

*Fast Forward to Mission* develops the missional-incarnational impulse into four practical movements:

1. **Move Out** (into missional engagement): The willingness to go to people, wherever that might be. Movement by definition suggests some form of motion, some type of action. The obligation is on us to go to them, not them to us.

2. **Move In** (burrowing into culture through incarnation): Deep identification with culture, becoming native to the context. This involves the six practices of incarnational mission.

3. **Move Alongside** (engaging in relationships and community): Building genuine friendships and relational networks. This is about engaging in the "nooks and crannies" of society through authentic relationships.

4. **Move From** (challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture): While we go deep into culture, we also challenge those aspects that dehumanize and contradict the gospel. This is the prophetic dimension that calls for transformation.

## System Dynamics

The missional and incarnational impulses work together as an integrated system:

1. **Mutual Necessity**: You cannot have authentic mission without both dimensions. Missional without incarnational becomes imposition. Incarnational without missional becomes accommodation.

2. **Dynamic Tension**: There is a necessary tension between going out and going deep. This tension is creative and productive, not destructive.

3. **Sequential Integration**: While both are always present, there is often a sequence: first we move out (missional), then we move in (incarnational), then we move alongside (relational), and finally we move from (prophetic challenge).

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: The incarnational impulse ensures that missional engagement respects and understands culture rather than imposing foreign forms.

5. **Gospel Integrity**: The missional impulse ensures that incarnational engagement maintains the integrity of the gospel rather than accommodating to culture.

6. **Reproduction**: The combination of missional and incarnational impulses enables the gospel to spread while adapting to each new context, maintaining both fidelity and relevance.

## Activation Principles

The missional-incarnational impulse activates when:

1. **Both dimensions are present**: The framework requires both missional (going out) and incarnational (going deep) to be active.

2. **Theological foundation is clear**: Understanding that mission flows from God's sending nature and incarnation demonstrates God's commitment to culture.

3. **Cultural engagement is intentional**: Deliberately moving into culture rather than expecting culture to come to us.

4. **The six practices are embodied**: Presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation are actively practiced.

5. **The four movements are operational**: Move Out, Move In, Move Alongside, and Move From are happening in the life of the community.

What blocks activation:
- **Evangelistic-attractional pattern**: Relying exclusively on "come to us" approaches
- **Cultural isolation**: Remaining foreign to culture rather than becoming native
- **One-dimensional engagement**: Having missional without incarnational, or vice versa
- **Fear of cultural contamination**: Avoiding deep cultural engagement out of fear
- **Lack of proximity**: Maintaining distance rather than moving close
- **Power dynamics**: Exercising power over rather than powerlessness with

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess if the missional-incarnational impulse is present and functioning:

1. **Evaluate sending capacity**: Are we going to them, or expecting them to come to us?

2. **Assess cultural identification**: Have we become native to our context, or do we remain foreign?

3. **Check for the six practices**: Are presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation evident?

4. **Examine the four movements**: Are we moving out, moving in, moving alongside, and moving from?

5. **Look for cultural engagement**: Are we engaging in the "nooks and crannies" of society?

Key questions:
- Are we going to them, or expecting them to come to us?
- Have we become native to our context, or do we remain foreign?
- Do we practice the six dimensions of incarnational mission?
- Are all four movements (out, in, alongside, from) operational?
- Is our engagement one-dimensional or integrated?

## Implementation Pathways

To embed the missional-incarnational impulse in your church or organization:

1. **Shift from attractional to missional**: Move from "come to us" to "go to them" thinking and practice.

2. **Develop cultural intelligence**: Learn to read culture, understand context, and identify what "good news" means in each setting.

3. **Practice the six dimensions**: Intentionally develop presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

4. **Operationalize the four movements**: 
   - Move Out: Go to where people are
   - Move In: Become native to the context
   - Move Alongside: Build authentic relationships
   - Move From: Challenge dehumanizing aspects

5. **Create proximity**: Physically and relationally move close to those you're called to reach.

6. **Embrace powerlessness**: Choose humility and vulnerability over power and control.

7. **Recognize prevenience**: Look for what God is already doing and join him there.

8. **Integrate both dimensions**: Ensure missional and incarnational work together, not in isolation.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Understand missio Dei and incarnation theologically
- Shift: Move from attractional to missional thinking
- Engage: Practice the six dimensions of incarnational mission
- Operationalize: Implement the four movements framework
- Integrate: Ensure both dimensions work together
- Reproduce: Enable the pattern to spread and adapt

## Case Studies and Examples

**The Early Church**: The missional-incarnational impulse was evident as the church spread throughout the Roman Empire, adapting to each cultural context while maintaining gospel integrity.

**The Chinese Underground Church**: Grew from 2 million to 120 million by going deep into Chinese culture while maintaining missional focus, becoming native to the context rather than remaining foreign.

**Uffizi Order (Santa Barbara)**: An agency dedicated to incarnational mission that exists to transform Santa Barbara into a little outpost of the kingdom by engaging in all the nooks and crannies of the city.

**Contemporary Missional Communities**: Many missional communities practice the four movements framework, moving out into neighborhoods, moving in through deep cultural engagement, moving alongside through authentic relationships, and moving from by challenging injustice.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Evangelistic-attractional pattern**: Relying exclusively on "come to us" approaches that block genuine missional engagement.

2. **One-dimensional engagement**: Having missional without incarnational (colonial imposition) or incarnational without missional (cultural accommodation).

3. **Cultural isolation**: Remaining foreign to culture rather than becoming native, maintaining distance rather than proximity.

4. **Fear of contamination**: Avoiding deep cultural engagement out of fear of being compromised.

5. **Power dynamics**: Exercising power over rather than powerlessness with, maintaining control rather than vulnerability.

6. **Lack of proximity**: Maintaining physical and relational distance rather than moving close.

7. **Ignoring prevenience**: Not recognizing what God is already doing in culture.

8. **Surface-level engagement**: Engaging culture superficially rather than going deep.

## Evolution and Development

The missional-incarnational impulse framework has evolved through:

**Early Development**: First introduced in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006) as one element of mDNA, exploring the twin impulses of remarkable missional movements.

**Expansion**: *Untamed* (2010) expanded the framework in Chapter 9, "Going Out, Going Deep," providing deeper exploration of both dimensions.

**Practical Application**: *Right Here, Right Now* (2011) and *Fast Forward to Mission* (2023) developed the four movements framework (Move Out, Move In, Move Alongside, Move From) for practical everyday mission.

**Cultural Engagement**: *Reframation* (2020) explored the practice of "romancing the city"—developing deep, loving relationships with culture through the art of paying attention, listening, and interpathy.

The understanding continues to develop as the framework is applied in diverse contexts and as connections to other frameworks are explored.
