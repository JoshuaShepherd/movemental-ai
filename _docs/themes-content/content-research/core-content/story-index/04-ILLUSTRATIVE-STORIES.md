## 1. Extended Metaphors

### Story: The Wizard of Oz - Ruby Slippers

**Type:** Extended Metaphor  
**Category:** Dormant Potential

**Summary:**
Alan uses the story of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz to illustrate the concept of dormant (or latent) potential. Dorothy was transported from Kansas to the Land of Oz and wanted to return home. After seeking the Wizard's help, she discovered she had the power to return home all along—she was wearing the ruby slippers. Similarly, God's people carry within themselves the same potencies that energized the early church and Chinese church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in every local church.

**Full Narrative:**
To perhaps nail down this rather elusive concept of dormant (or latent) potential, let me use a well-loved story. This is Dorothy, who was transported in a big tornado from Kansas to the magical Land of Oz. Wanting to return home, she gets guidance from Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, who advises her to walk to the Emerald City and there consult the Wizard. On the yellow brick road, she meets the Scarecrow, who wants the Wizard to give him some brains; the Tin Man, who wants the Wizard to give him a heart; and the Lion, who wants the Wizard to give him courage.

After surviving some dangerous encounters with the Wicked Witch of the West, they eventually make it to see the Wizard, only to discover that he is a hoax. They had been looking for something outside themselves, but the magic in Dorothy's ruby slippers, won't leave them alone. After a final confrontation, they overcome the source of evil and thereby liberate Oz. But through all their adventures, they discover that they were looking for—in fact, they have had it all along. The Scarecrow is actually quite smart after all; the Tin Man is actually quite loving; the Lion is actually brave and courageous after all. They haven't needed the Wizard after all; what they needed was to recognize and activate that which is already in them. They have had what they all have been looking for.

And Dorothy? She had the power to fulfill her wish to return home all along; she is wearing them—her ruby slippers. The answers are always there; we just need to look beyond our own limited understanding and be willing to do something about it.

God's people carry within themselves the same potencies that energized the early church and the Chinese church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in you, me, and every local church. We have simply forgotten how to access and trigger it. This book is written to help us identify and reactivate these dormant potentials so that we might see a truly transformative Jesus movement in the West.

**Key Details:**
- Source: The Wizard of Oz
- Characters: Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion
- Key element: Ruby slippers
- Insight: Power was there all along
- Application: Apostolic Genius lies dormant in every church

**Context:**
This metaphor illustrates that Apostolic Genius is not something new to be created but something latent to be recovered. The potential already exists within every expression of church.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Introduction
- **Section:** "The Forgotten Ways" - dormant potential

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Dormant potential, latent Apostolic Genius, recovery
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** mDNA is present but dormant
- **Themes Addressed:** Potential, activation, recovery
- **Key Principles:** The future lies in the womb of the present; potential already exists

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate that Apostolic Genius is not something to be created but something to be recovered. The power is already there, we just need to activate it.

**Cross-References:**
- Dormant potential concept
- Recovery of Apostolic Genius
- Early church and Chinese church (proof the potential exists)

### Story: The Skylark Parable

**Type:** Parable  
**Category:** Compromise and Discipleship

**Summary:**
A skylark is lured by a merchant (the devil in disguise) who offers two worms for one feather. Day after day, the skylark returns, trading feathers for worms, until one day she can no longer fly. She has grown fat and plucked all her feathers. The merchant grabs the helpless bird, puts her in a cage, and walks away laughing. This illustrates how Christians gradually give up their freedoms in Christ through a thousand little compromises, ending up in a "cage of a thousand compromises."

**Full Narrative:**
One day long ago, over the hot sands of a Middle Eastern country, a white skylark flew in joyous loops about the sky. As she swooped near the earth, she heard a merchant calling, "Come here, my little friend. Come! See the lovely worms I have!" The skylark circled about the merchant, hungry at the sight. Little did the skylark know that the merchant was the devil in disguise. He motioned her nearer. "Come here, my little friend. Come! See the lovely worms I have!" Cautiously, the skylark landed and cocked her head to the merchant. "Come! Taste the juicy worms!" The skylark became aware that she was, indeed, quite hungry. And these worms looked bigger and tastier than any she had ever dug for herself out of the hardscrabble ground of the desert.

The skylark hopped closer and put her beak up close to the worm. "Two worms for a feather, my friend. Two worms for merely one!" The skylark was unable to resist. And she had, after all, so many feathers. So, with a swift motion she pulled out a feather—just a small one—from beneath her wing and gave it to the merchant. "Take your pick, my little friend... any two, your heart's desire!" The skylark quickly snatched up two of the plumpest worms and swallowed her meal with delight. With a loud chirp, she leapt into the air and resumed her joyful flight.

Day after day the skylark returned. And always the merchant had wonderful worms to offer: black ones and blue ones, red ones and green ones, all fat and shiny and iridescent.

But one day, after eating her fill, the skylark leapt again into the air—and to her horror, she fell to the ground with a thud.

She was unable to fly!

All at once with a shock she realized what had happened.

From eating the delicious worms she had grown fatter and fatter; and she had plucked her feathers one by one, first her body, then her tail, and finally her very wings had grown balder and balder. Horrified, she remembered how, slowly, imperceptibly, day by day, it had been getting harder and harder to fly, and how she had told herself it was no matter. She could always stop before it was too late. Now suddenly here she was, trapped on the ground. She looked up and saw the merchant looking at her. Was that a small, sly grin spreading across his face? He grabbed the now helpless bird, put her in a cage, and walked away laughing.

**Key Details:**
- Characters: Skylark, merchant (devil in disguise)
- Temptation: Two worms for one feather
- Process: Gradual, imperceptible
- Result: Can no longer fly, trapped in cage
- Application: Christians give up freedoms through compromises

**Context:**
This parable opens Untamed and illustrates how Christians gradually compromise their discipleship through small, seemingly harmless choices, eventually losing their ability to "fly" (live the untamed life Jesus calls us to).

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** Untamed
- **Chapter:** Introduction, "The First Word"
- **Section:** Opening parable

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Compromise, gradual decline, discipleship obstacles
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** How discipleship is undermined
- **Themes Addressed:** Discipleship, compromise, freedom, captivity
- **Key Principles:** Small compromises lead to big captivity; gradual decline is dangerous

**Usage Notes:**
Used as the opening story of Untamed to illustrate the central problem the book addresses: how Christians gradually lose their capacity for untamed discipleship through compromises.

**Cross-References:**
- Discipleship obstacles
- Consumerism
- The "cage of a thousand compromises"

### Story: Finding Nemo - The Fish Tank Metaphor

**Type:** Extended Metaphor  
**Category:** Artificial Environments

**Summary:**
Alan uses the story from Finding Nemo to illustrate how churches can become artificial environments like fish tanks. When Nemo is first introduced to the aquarium, the other fish recoil because he is "unscrubbed" and represents danger. Living in the artificial environment of the fish tank, the fish have lost their ability to cope with normal dangers. Churches can similarly become artificial environments that protect people from the world but also make them unable to cope with real challenges.

**Full Narrative:**
In Finding Nemo, a young fish called Nemo is captured by a fish collector, and Marlin, his ever-cautious father, embarks on a dangerous trek to find him. But the focus here is more on the artificial environment to which Nemo has been taken. When Nemo is first introduced from the ocean into the aquarium: they all recoil from him, because he is "unscrubbed." He is a danger to the fish in the tank, because living in the artificial environment of the fish tank, they have lost their ability to cope with normal dangers, including normal bugs that their sea cousins cope with very well. So Nemo has to go through a disinfecting cleanup. Only then will the other fish dare to come close and interact with him. The nasty dentist forgets to clean the tank or to feed them, but on the whole the fish are safe, protected, and well fed. But they dream of escape and long to face the risky freedom of the ocean again.

In the same way, when churches become artificial environments with little engagement with the "outside world," churches quickly become sheltered artificial environments that are unable to cope with the normal disturbances in the surrounding environment. They become closed systems that are cut off from meaningful cultural associations with the world outside (and we call this holiness). People who come in from the "outside" have to be "cleaned up" quick. To push the metaphor just a little further, these churches are like fish tanks that are maintained by "dentists"—clergy who are cloistered from the world, who feed the insiders and keep things stable, nice, and safe.

I don't intend to be mean and cynical here, but does this not sound like many of our churches? It does. Once again, this does not imply that God is not to be found in such places, but it does mean that these churches are found by the "found" and not by the "lost," because the "lost" can't seem to get past the "disinfecting" process.

**Key Details:**
- Source: Finding Nemo (movie)
- Characters: Nemo, fish in aquarium
- Problem: Artificial environment, loss of ability to cope with normal dangers
- Application: Churches as artificial environments
- Insight: Churches become safe but unable to engage the world

**Context:**
This metaphor illustrates how churches can become artificial environments that protect people but also make them unable to engage with the real world. It demonstrates the problem with creating "safe" spaces that are disconnected from mission.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas"
- **Section:** "Jesus Is My Disequilibrium" - artificial environments

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Artificial environments, safety vs. mission, engagement with world
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** How churches become disconnected
- **Themes Addressed:** Mission, safety, world engagement, liminality
- **Key Principles:** Safety can kill mission; artificial environments prevent engagement

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate how churches can become artificial environments that protect people but prevent mission. Demonstrates the tension between safety and engagement.

**Cross-References:**
- Liminality and communitas
- Mission vs. safety
- Engagement with world

### Story: The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship

**Type:** Extended Metaphor  
**Category:** Communitas

**Summary:**
Alan uses The Lord of the Rings trilogy, particularly the Fellowship of the Ring, to illustrate communitas. An unlikely group (hobbits, humans, elf, dwarf, wizard) is forged into a fellowship through a shared ordeal and mission. They find each other in ways they would not have in normal circumstances. The story demonstrates mission, discipleship, and communitas working together.

**Full Narrative:**
Let us consider the mythic truth in J. R. R. Tolkien's remarkable trilogy The Lord of the Rings. The story (and the communitas to come) begins with a young hobbit called Frodo, who finds himself in possession of the Ring of Power. This magic ring was made by Sauron the Dark Lord to concentrate and control all the powers of Middle-earth. The ring was thus made to assemble all the powers under the supreme influence of evil and concentrate them in one place. The problem is that none can handle it without being deeply changed by it. In all Middle-earth, only Frodo seems able to resist the lure of its coercive power, and even they come under its power and are changed.

The task falls to Frodo to get this ring to the house of Elrond, and against all odds, he decides to take the adventure. You need to know that hobbits rarely, if ever, travel out of their comfortable shire. They live in burrow-like homes. They are not adventurous. Samwise Gamgee insinuates himself into the adventure, and they are joined by Frodo's cousins, the mischievous pair Merry and Pippin. On the road, they are pursued by Ringwraiths, Black Riders sent by Sauron to recover the ring.

After many adventures (including encounters with Ringwraiths and other foul creatures), they make it to the Council of Elrond, where all the great ones of Middle-earth are gathered. But none of them can take the ring for fear of being corrupted by it. Frodo, having recently recovered from his ordeal, and recognizing his duty, agrees to take the Ring to Mount Doom, to the black heart of Mordor, to destroy it. The chance of success is very slim. But it is decided that against the odds, they will undertake it. At this point, the Fellowship of the Ring is formed, consisting of Frodo and Sam (the hobbits), Legolas (the elf), Gimli (the dwarf), Aragorn (the exiled king), Boromir (an honorable but desperate human prince), and Gandalf the wizard. It is also important to note that this is a rather unlikely group: elves and dwarves are traditional enemies; humans are as divided as their kingdoms, and the hobbits are not warriors at all. But the combined skills and sheer willpower of this strange fellowship wins the day.

The Fellowship of the Ring actually becomes a real fellowship, a comradeship, forged in the fires of a shared ordeal and a common mission to overcome evil. By undertaking this seemingly impossible (and liminal) task and by facing overwhelming odds together, they find one another in a way they would not, or could not, in any other circumstance. The story beautifully weaves together mission (overcoming the source of evil in the world), discipleship (constantly choosing goodness in the face of overwhelming opposition), and communitas (becoming a great community together in pursuit of a mission). The elf and the dwarf become inseparable friends, something that would never have happened had they remained in the safety of the shire. The members of the fellowship are transformed by their shared ordeal and common mission.

**Key Details:**
- Source: The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien)
- Characters: Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf
- Mission: Destroy the Ring of Power
- Formation: Unlikely group forged through shared ordeal
- Result: Deep communitas, transformation

**Context:**
This story is used extensively to illustrate communitas—the deep community that forms through shared mission and ordeal. It demonstrates how mission, discipleship, and communitas work together.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways, The Faith of Leap
- **Chapter:** The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 7; The Faith of Leap, Chapter 4
- **Section:** Discussion of communitas

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Communitas, liminality, shared mission, transformation
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** How communitas forms
- **Themes Addressed:** Community, mission, adventure, transformation

### Story: The Lord of the Rings - Return to Hobbiton

**Type:** Illustrative Story  
**Category:** Communitas Recognition

**Summary:**
After Frodo and Sam destroy the ring and return to Hobbiton, they find themselves at an inn with other hobbits who are laughing and carousing, going on with life as normal. But Frodo and his friends have experienced an adventure like no other. They look at each other with a long, knowing look—something unspoken is powerfully communicated. They know each other. This is communitas.

**Full Narrative:**
In the third installment, The Return of the King, there is a charming scene where, after Frodo and Sam have finally destroyed the ring and Mordor has been defeated, the four hobbits return to normal life in sleepy Hobbiton. There, they find themselves at a large wooden table at a noisy, busy inn. The other drinkers are laughing and carousing, going on with life as they had always known it. But Frodo and his friends have experienced an adventure like no other. They have looked death in the face many times, and by rallying together they have not only survived but triumphed over evil. What of this experience could their friends and neighbors possibly understand? As they raise their tankards of ale to their lips, they look at each other—a long, knowing look. As their eyes meet, something unspoken is powerfully communicated. They know each other. No words can express what they're thinking, but they know each other's thoughts.

This is the society found only in communitas.

**Key Details:**
- Scene: Return to Hobbiton after the adventure
- Setting: Inn with other hobbits
- Recognition: Unspoken understanding between fellowship members
- Insight: This is communitas

**Context:**
This scene illustrates the recognition and bond that exists in communitas—an unspoken understanding that comes from shared ordeal and mission.

### Story: Paul's Missionary Journeys as "Scarlet Track of Bleeding Hare"

**Type:** Extended Metaphor  
**Category:** Apostolic Ministry

**Summary:**
One of the most powerful metaphors of Paul's missionary journeys is that of the scarlet track of a bleeding hare across the snow. The image, first employed in a sermon by John Henry Jowett, of a startling red slash across the whitened landscape reminds us that Paul's ministry was one of constant self-emptying. This brave, rather unlikely hero led his band of spiritual warriors to and fro across the Roman Empire, all the while bleeding for their cause.

**Full Narrative:**
But we must remember that apostles are primarily pioneering idea-missionaries who advance the gospel onto new ground and at the same time provide meaningful leadership for movements. But at the core, the nonnegotiable task of the biblical apostles was to guard and maintain the missionary impulses of the church. In pursuit of this task then, one of the most powerful metaphors of Paul's missionary journeys is that of the scarlet track of a bleeding hare across the snow. The image, first employed in a sermon by John Henry Jowett, of a startling red slash across the whitened landscape reminds us that Paul's ministry was one of constant self-emptying. This brave, rather unlikely hero led his band of spiritual warriors to and fro across the Roman Empire, all the while bleeding for their cause, the redemption of that very empire. What he experiences along the way is extreme and relentless liminality. But in the same process he also gets as close to God as a man can get (2 Cor. 12:1–5; Phil. 3:7–11), he reframes theological thinking for all time, and he starts a transformative movement of the gospel of Jesus into the Greco-Roman world that extends down through the corridors of time to this very time and place in which we stand.

**Key Details:**
- Source: John Henry Jowett sermon
- Image: Scarlet track of bleeding hare across snow
- Meaning: Constant self-emptying, bleeding for the cause
- Application: Paul's apostolic ministry
- Characteristic: Extreme and relentless liminality

**Context:**
This metaphor illustrates the cost and nature of apostolic ministry—constant self-emptying, bleeding for the cause, extreme liminality, but also profound intimacy with God and transformative impact.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Faith of Leap
- **Chapter:** Chapter 4, "The Hero's Journey"
- **Section:** Opening discussion of Paul

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Apostolic ministry, self-emptying, cost, liminality
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** APEST (apostolic function)
- **Themes Addressed:** Leadership, mission, cost, transformation
- **Key Principles:** Apostolic ministry requires self-emptying; liminality is constant

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate the nature and cost of apostolic ministry, showing that it requires constant self-emptying and involves extreme liminality.

**Cross-References:**
- Paul's Missionary Journeys
- Apostolic ministry
- Liminality and communitas

## 2. Parables and Analogies

### Story: The Starfish and the Spider

**Type:** Analogy  
**Category:** Organizational Structure

**Summary:**
The starfish and spider metaphor illustrates the difference between institutional and movemental organization. A spider has a head (central control) and legs (dependent parts)—cut off the head and the spider dies. A starfish has a distributed nervous system—cut it in half and you get two starfish. Movements operate like starfish: they are decentralized, distributed, and can reproduce from any part.

**Full Narrative:**
[This metaphor is developed extensively in The Starfish and the Spirit but also referenced in other works]

The starfish and spider metaphor illustrates the difference between institutional and movemental organization.

**Key Details:**
- Spider: Central control, dies if head is removed
- Starfish: Distributed system, reproduces from any part
- Application: Institutions vs. movements
- Insight: Movements are decentralized and distributed

**Context:**
This analogy is central to understanding movement dynamics and is developed extensively in The Starfish and the Spirit.

## 3. Hypothetical Examples

### Story: Jane's Church Experience (Dualistic Spirituality)

**Type:** Hypothetical Example  
**Category:** Dualistic Spirituality Illustration

**Summary:**
Alan creates a hypothetical example of "Jane," an average churchgoer, to illustrate how dualistic spirituality (sacred vs. secular) shapes people's experience of church and mission. Jane experiences God primarily in the "sacred" space of church, but feels disconnected from God in the "secular" world.

**Full Narrative:**
Let's play this out: Jane is an average churchgoer. She loves God and wants to serve him, but she finds it hard to put it all together so that it makes sense of her faith. How does she experience church? On Sunday she goes to church (the middle circle). Church fellowship happens in the middle circle, and she feels safe and reassured when she is around them, because the tension she normally feels in the world is temporarily suspended. During "fellowship," she goes into the chapel area (symbolized by the interface between the middle and top circles), where the "sacred" kicks in, the worship starts, and she is drawn up into a form of ecstasy as she begins to engage her heart in the worship of God. And all of a sudden, she begins to feel that she is really connecting with God. After the praise and worship, the pastor, Bill, preaches. Bill is a great preacher, and she feels that the sermon really "fed her." So in the middle circle, she experiences community; in the top circle, she experiences God. But then the service ends, the pastor pronounces the benediction, and God is symbolically "sent back" to heaven. Jane finds herself back in the middle circle having been "sent out" into the world (symbolized by the "world" circle). Laboring as she is under a dualistic understanding of life and faith, she experiences God as being primarily "in the church" and not "in the world." God is not perceived as being "in the world" in any meaningful way. The same thing happens in the midweek cell group, where she undergoes an experience similar to that of Sunday. Sometimes God "turns up," but other than that she feels that she is rather on her own in the world.

**Key Details:**
- Character: Jane (hypothetical)
- Experience: Dualistic spirituality
- Problem: God experienced primarily in church, not in world
- Result: Disconnected from mission

**Context:**
This hypothetical example illustrates how dualistic spirituality (sacred vs. secular) shapes people's experience and prevents missional engagement.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas"
- **Section:** "Beyond the Either-Or Church"

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Dualistic spirituality, sacred vs. secular, mission disconnect
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** How dualism prevents mission
- **Themes Addressed:** Spirituality, mission, dualism
- **Key Principles:** Dualism prevents mission; God is in the world

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate how dualistic spirituality prevents missional engagement and creates a disconnect between church and world.

**Cross-References:**
- Dualistic spirituality
- Missional-incarnational impulse
- All-of-life spirituality

## 4. Cultural and Pop Culture References

### Story: The Hero's Journey in Movies (Disney, Star Wars, etc.)

**Type:** Cultural Reference  
**Category:** Hero's Journey Pattern

**Summary:**
Alan extensively references how the hero's journey pattern appears in popular movies, particularly Disney films (The Lion King, etc.) and Star Wars. These stories resonate because they follow the universal pattern of the hero's journey, which is also the pattern of Jesus' life and Christian discipleship.

**Full Narrative:**
[See The Faith of Leap, Chapter 4 for extensive development]

The hero's journey pattern appears throughout popular culture, particularly in movies. Disney films since 1989 (The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.) follow this pattern. Star Wars was explicitly inspired by Joseph Campbell's work on the hero's journey. These stories resonate because they follow the universal pattern that is also the pattern of Jesus' life and Christian discipleship.

**Key Details:**
- Pattern: Hero's journey (Campbell/Vogler)
- Examples: Disney films, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, etc.
- Insight: Universal pattern that resonates
- Connection: Pattern of Jesus' life and discipleship

**Context:**
These references illustrate that the hero's journey is a universal pattern that resonates deeply with people, and that it's also the pattern of Christian discipleship.
