## Story Selection Principles

### 1. Match Story to Concept

Choose stories that directly illustrate the concept you're teaching. Don't force a story to fit.

### 2. Use Multiple Stories

One story illustrates; multiple stories prove. Use historical + contemporary + personal examples.

### 3. Build Understanding Progressively

Start with accessible stories (Wizard of Oz), then move to historical (Early Church), then contemporary (CMA).

### 4. Use Stories to Create Tension

Stories like Methodist Decline or South Melbourne create helpful tension that leads to learning.

### 5. Connect Stories to Framework

Always connect stories back to the framework (mDNA, APEST, etc.) so they're not just entertaining but instructive.

## Storytelling Tips

### 1. Tell the Full Story

Don't just reference stories—tell them. People remember stories, not concepts.

### 2. Connect to Experience

Help people see themselves in the story. "Like Jane..." or "Just as the skylark..."

### 3. Use Details

Specific details (25,000 to 20 million, "every person a church planter") make stories memorable.

### 4. Create Contrast

Use stories that create helpful contrast (Early Church vs. contemporary church, communitas vs. community).

### 5. End with Application

Always connect the story to "So what does this mean for us?" or "How does this apply?"

---

## Stories to Avoid (or Use Carefully)

### Overused Stories
- Some stories (like Early Church Growth) are used extensively. Vary your examples.

### Complex Stories
- Some stories require extensive setup. Make sure your audience can follow.

### Controversial Stories
- Some stories (like Burning Man) may offend some audiences. Know your context.

### Incomplete Stories
- Don't reference stories you can't tell fully. Partial stories confuse more than help.

---

## Building Your Story Repertoire

### Start Here
1. Master 5-10 core stories
2. Know them well enough to tell without notes
3. Practice connecting them to frameworks
4. Build from there

### Expand Gradually
- Add stories as you encounter them
- Test stories with different audiences
- Refine your telling based on response
- Build your personal story collection

## Questions for Story Selection

Before choosing a story, ask:

1. **Does it illustrate the concept?** (Not just entertain)
2. **Is it appropriate for this audience?** (Age, background, context)
3. **Can I tell it well?** (Know it thoroughly)
4. **Does it create helpful tension?** (Leads to learning)
5. **Can I connect it to application?** (Not just a story)
