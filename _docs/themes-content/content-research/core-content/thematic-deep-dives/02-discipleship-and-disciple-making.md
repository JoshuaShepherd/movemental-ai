# Discipleship and Disciple-Making: The Essential Practice

## Theme Overview

Discipleship is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. He did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs—he made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was the foundational strategy from which the church would emerge. Discipleship is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move; it is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making.

Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us. Discipleship means learning to think, feel, and act like Jesus—not just knowing about him but knowing him and being known by him in the most intimate sense.

A critical insight developed throughout the corpus is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

Discipleship must be "untamed"—wild, radical, dangerous, matching the untamed nature of the Messiah we follow. It involves the inseparability of mission and discipleship—you cannot have one without the other. Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of discipleship appears early and develops significantly throughout the corpus. In **The Forgotten Ways** (2006), Chapter 5, "Disciple Making," establishes discipleship as one of the six essential elements of movement DNA. Here, the connection between discipleship and movement is made explicit: all significant missional movements in history have been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. The chapter explores how movements like the early church, the Chinese underground church, and early Methodism maintained disciple-making as a core practice.

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch) represents a major expansion of this theme, dedicating the entire book to "missional discipleship." The book explores obstacles to authentic discipleship in three areas: theology (false images of God and Jesus), culture (the subverting influence of consumerism, money, and status), and personal issues (identity, sexuality, family). The book introduces the concept of "Jesus-shaped discipleship" and "Shema spirituality," showing how discipleship must take Jesus with utmost seriousness and involve loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength.

**Disciplism** (2014) takes this theme to its logical conclusion, arguing that discipleship should be the "ism" that shapes our approach—not evangelism as a separate activity, but disciplism as the comprehensive framework. The book critiques how contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach. It argues that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

**ReJesus** (2009, with Michael Frost) connects this theme to the centrality of Jesus, showing how discipleship is our lifelong and heartfelt response to Jesus as Lord and Savior. Chapter 2, "ReJesus and Personal Renewal," explores how being taken captive by Jesus reshapes our view of God, the church, and the world.

**Right Here, Right Now** (2011, with Lance Ford) applies this theme to everyday mission, showing how discipleship happens in the context of daily life and relationships.

**Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly) develops this theme through the lens of transformation, showing how "wholehearted metanoia" requires the integration of mind, soul, and will. Chapter 5, "Wholehearted Metanoia," explores how discipleship involves ongoing conversion and transformation at every level of our being.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: discipleship is the essential practice of the church, the key to multiplication and transformation, and the context within which evangelism naturally happens. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different dimensions—personal formation, community life, mission, and organizational transformation.

## Theological Foundations

Discipleship is rooted in the very nature of God's mission and the pattern of Jesus' ministry. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) explicitly commands us to "make disciples," not merely to make converts or to grow churches. This command reveals that discipleship is not an optional extra but the core task of the church.

The biblical understanding of discipleship involves several key elements:

**Jesus-Shaped Discipleship**: Discipleship is centered on the person and example of Jesus. As C. S. Lewis writes, "The Church exists for no other purpose but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs." Discipleship means becoming like Jesus, being conformed to his image (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

**Shema Spirituality**: The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) provides the framework for discipleship. Jesus places this at the epicenter of what it means to be a true disciple—to love God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love neighbor as self. This is not merely a command but a description of the whole of life lived in response to God.

**The Inseparability of Mission and Discipleship**: You cannot be a disciple without being a missionary—a sent one. Mission is not something we do after we become disciples; it is integral to the process of becoming disciples. As the corpus consistently argues, "no mission, no discipleship."

**The Prophetic Call to Faithfulness**: Discipleship requires radical obedience. It is not about learning information but about embodying the message and mission of Jesus. This involves taking up the cross (Matthew 16:24), losing one's life to find it (Matthew 10:39), and following Jesus wherever he leads.

**The Embodiment of the Message**: Discipleship involves giving flesh to the ideas and experiences that animate us. The message must be lived out, not just taught. As Jim Wallis says, "The only way to propagate a message is to live it." This is why movements that maintain discipleship as core practice are so powerful—the message is embodied in the lives of the people.

The theological foundation shows that discipleship is not a program or a curriculum but a way of life—a lifelong journey of becoming like Jesus and participating in his mission in the world.

## Historical Precedents

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. The early church grew exponentially because it maintained disciple-making as a core practice. New converts were not immediately welcomed into full community participation but went through a rigorous process of catechesis that could take years. This process ensured that the message was deeply embedded in the lives of new believers.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When persecution forced the church underground, it developed what it called the "catechumen system"—rigorous personal examinations that required proposed converts to demonstrate genuine commitment before being allowed to become part of the Christian community. This was contrary to "seeker-sensitive" practice but essential for maintaining the movement's integrity and power.

The early Methodist movement, under John Wesley, maintained disciple-making through classes and bands—small groups where people were held accountable for their spiritual growth and missional engagement. This commitment to discipleship led to remarkable growth, with one in thirty people in Britain becoming Methodist. However, when Methodism moved away from this focus, making discipleship optional, the movement declined.

Contemporary movements that are growing exponentially—such as Church Multiplication Associates (CMA), the Soma Network, and New Thing—all require high levels of discipleship throughout their systems. They have discovered that you cannot reproduce leaders without first reproducing disciples, and you cannot reproduce churches without reproducing leaders.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain disciple-making as a core practice thrive and multiply. Movements that make discipleship optional or secondary decline, even with other good practices in place.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, discipleship faces particular challenges. Consumerism has co-opted the church, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach that fails to challenge the primary religion of most seekers. The church growth movement, while well-intentioned, reversed the order of the Great Commission, focusing on event-based proclamation rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making.

The contemporary application requires:

**Reframing Evangelism**: Evangelism must be reframed within the context of discipleship rather than the reverse. The Great Commission commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. This means beginning with the end in mind—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start.

**Recovering Jesus-Shaped Discipleship**: Discipleship must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Every aspect of life needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. This means making the Gospels the primary text, shaping all practices around following Jesus, and ensuring that discipleship involves becoming like him.

**Addressing Obstacles**: Discipleship must address obstacles in three areas: theology (false images of God and Jesus), culture (consumerism, money, status), and personal issues (identity, sexuality, family). These obstacles must be identified and addressed if authentic discipleship is to occur.

**Creating Reproducible Systems**: Discipleship systems must be simple and reproducible. If the initial model is not readily reproducible by the "nonprofessional" regular Christian, then it will not be magically reproducible later. Systems like Life Transformation Groups (LTG), BELLS, and other simple, reproducible practices enable movements to scale while maintaining core DNA.

**Integrating Mission**: Discipleship cannot be separated from mission. You cannot be a disciple without being a missionary. This means that discipleship must happen in the context of mission, not in isolation from it.

The contemporary application requires courage to challenge consumeristic approaches, to raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple, and to create systems that enable multiplication rather than addition.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of discipleship connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Anthropology**: The study of how knowledge and practices are transmitted across generations illuminates how discipleship functions as a form of cultural transmission. The work of Victor Turner on liminality and communitas shows how threshold experiences create the conditions for deep learning and transformation.

**Educational Theory**: The distinction between "action-learning" (discipleship) and "the academy" (information transfer) shows how discipleship requires learning in context, through modeling and practice, rather than through abstract instruction. The work of educational philosophers like Jean Piaget and developmental psychologists shows how learning follows a U-shaped curve of unlearning and relearning.

**Organizational Theory**: The study of how movements maintain core DNA while scaling shows how disciple-making systems must be simple, reproducible, and embedded in the culture of the organization. The work on "living systems" and "chaordic organizations" illuminates how disciple-making functions as a self-organizing, self-replicating system.

**Psychology**: Studies on identity formation, habit formation, and behavioral change show how discipleship involves transformation at the deepest levels of human personality. The work on "embodied cognition" shows how practices shape beliefs, not just the reverse.

**Sociology**: Research on social movements shows how successful movements maintain rigorous standards for participation. The work on "social capital" and "network theory" shows how disciple-making creates the relational networks that enable movement multiplication.

**Communication Theory**: The study of how ideas spread shows how disciple-making functions as a form of "viral" transmission—the message is passed from person to person through relationships and embodied practice.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how discipleship functions as both spiritual practice and organizational principle for transformative movements.

## Practical Implications

The theme of discipleship has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must make disciple-making the core practice, not an optional program. This means creating systems that enable every member to be discipled and to disciple others. It means raising the bar of what it means to be a Christian, requiring commitment and accountability. It means ensuring that all activities—worship, community, mission—serve the larger purpose of making disciples who can make disciples.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model what it means to be a disciple. This means personal discipleship that takes Jesus seriously, leadership that serves rather than dominates, and a commitment to developing other leaders through the process of disciple-making. Leaders must create environments where discipleship can flourish, providing tools, training, and support for the disciple-making process.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to the lifelong journey of becoming like Jesus. This means active engagement with the Gospels, participation in accountable relationships, and involvement in mission. It means bringing every aspect of life under the claim of Jesus' lordship. It means being willing to disciple others, passing on what we have received.

**Specific Applications**:
- Create simple, reproducible disciple-making systems (like LTGs, BELLS, or other practices)
- Make the Gospels the primary text for discipleship
- Integrate mission into the disciple-making process from the start
- Address obstacles to discipleship in theology, culture, and personal life
- Ensure that disciple-making is accessible to all, not just professionals
- Create accountability structures that support growth
- Develop leaders through the disciple-making process, not separate from it
- Measure success by disciple-making, not just attendance or programs

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we maintain rigorous standards for discipleship while remaining accessible to seekers?** There is a tension between raising the bar and welcoming people where they are. How do we navigate this tension?

**How do we create disciple-making systems that are both simple and comprehensive?** Systems must be simple enough to be reproducible by regular Christians, yet comprehensive enough to facilitate genuine transformation.

**How do we address the obstacles to discipleship in contemporary culture?** Consumerism, individualism, and other cultural forces work against authentic discipleship. How do we help people overcome these obstacles?

**How do we integrate mission into discipleship without making it merely pragmatic?** Mission must be integral to discipleship, but how do we ensure it flows from relationship with Jesus rather than from mere activism?

**How do we help people move from information to transformation?** Many people know about Jesus but don't know him. How do we facilitate the move from knowledge to relationship, from information to embodiment?

**How do we create disciple-making systems that scale while maintaining quality?** As movements grow, there is a temptation to lower standards or outsource disciple-making. How do we maintain quality while enabling multiplication?

**How do we address the personal obstacles to discipleship?** Issues of identity, sexuality, family, and other personal concerns can block authentic discipleship. How do we address these with grace and truth?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to recover the art of disciple-making in contemporary contexts.
