# Cultural Engagement: Romancing the City

## Theme Overview

Cultural engagement represents the church's call to understand, engage, and reframe culture missionally. This is not about accommodating culture or conforming to it, but about developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach—what Michael Frost calls "romancing the city." It's courtship rather than speed dating, patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work.

The problem is that we often fail to understand culture because we fail to get to know it. We tend to exegete Scripture pretty well while failing miserably at exegeting the culture/s in which we are immersed. This is like going on multiple first dates, all of which rarely make it past introductions and an appetizer—"speed dating evangelism." Hardly the way of Jesus, who loved the world so much that he moved into the neighborhood for thirty years and no one noticed!

Cultural engagement requires three key practices: **the art of paying attention** (like Moses at the burning bush, noticing what God is already doing), **the art of listening** (learning what "good news" means to each context), and **the practice of interpathy** (deep cross-cultural empathy that allows us to climb into another's skin and walk around in it).

The practice of "romancing the city" involves developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This is courtship rather than speed dating—patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work. It requires recognizing that God is already present in every person, in every place, and in all things. We don't bring God with us; he's already there, waiting for us to become aware enough to show up.

Cultural engagement also involves becoming "detectives of divinity," learning to read culture and people to discover their ultimate longings. This requires understanding universal human desires: longing for justice, thirst for spirituality, hunger for relationship, delight in beauty, and the need for significance and meaning. When we understand these longings, we can connect them to the gospel in ways that resonate deeply.

Reframation calls for living "in/credible" lives that make others want to say "I'll have what they're having." This involves becoming "theological persons" whose lives bespeak theology, living "questionable lives" that arouse curiosity and invite questions, and participating in "tikkun olam"—repairing the world—as a way to join Jesus' mission of restoration.

The Great Reframation is not about changing the gospel but about recovering its fullness, removing the frames that have narrowed our vision, and seeing God, people, and mission through re-enchanted eyes. It requires humility (recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is"), childlikeness (approaching with wonder rather than cynicism), and the willingness to have our minds blown by the ever-greater God.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of cultural engagement appears throughout the corpus, receiving its most comprehensive treatment in **Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson), but it is also developed in other works.

**Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): This entire book is dedicated to cultural engagement, exploring how to put new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. Chapter 5, "Thro' Narrow Chinks in the Cavern," explores how metanoia enables us to see through re-enchanted eyes. Chapter 10, "Romancing the City," develops the practice of cultural engagement in depth, emphasizing the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of interpathy.

**The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 6, "Missional-Incarnational Impulse," touches on cultural engagement through the incarnational impulse, showing how the church must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. It emphasizes that the gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation.

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 9, "Going Out, Going Deep," explores cultural engagement through the six P's of incarnational practice, showing how presence, proximity, and prevenience enable authentic engagement with culture.

**Right Here, Right Now** (2011, with Lance Ford): Throughout, this book explores how to engage missionally in everyday contexts, showing how cultural engagement happens "right here, right now" in the ordinary places of life.

**Fast Forward to Mission** (2023): Both chapters develop cultural engagement into four movements: **Move Out** (into missional engagement), **Move In** (burrowing into culture through incarnation), **Move Alongside** (engaging in relationships and community), and **Move From** (challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture).

**5Q** (2017): Preface, "In Praise of Soft Eyes," introduces the concept of "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms, to see the whole picture rather than just analytical details. Soft eyes enable us to see what is really there, to recognize the "shards of heaven's kaleidoscope" (the image of God) in every human soul.

**Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Related themes of perception and paradigm shift, showing how metanoia enables us to see culture through fresh eyes and engage with it in new ways.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: cultural engagement is essential for mission. The church must understand, engage, and reframe culture missionally, developing deep relationships that enable the gospel to take root and flourish. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different contexts—from urban to suburban, from Western to cross-cultural, from everyday life to specialized mission.

## Theological Foundations

The theme of cultural engagement is deeply rooted in biblical theology, drawing from the doctrine of creation, the incarnation, and the missio Dei.

**The Doctrine of Creation**: The doctrine of creation shows that God is present in all things. As J. V. Taylor notes, "Wherever God exists he exists wholly." This means that the whole cosmos and life itself are directly connected to God and are expressions of his creative design. God is not limited to the church but is present throughout creation, including in culture.

**The Incarnation**: The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously. When God became human in Jesus, he took on flesh and dwelt among us, becoming native to a specific culture rather than remaining foreign. This shows that culture is not something to be avoided but something to be engaged, understood, and transformed.

**Prevenient Grace**: The doctrine of prevenient grace (preparatory grace) shows that God is already at work in every person and every culture, wooing them into relationship. As John Wesley taught, God is always preparing the way for the preaching of the gospel, working in every person, wooing them into relationship in and through Jesus. We don't bring God with us; he's already there, waiting for us to become aware enough to join him.

**The Missio Dei**: The mission of God shows that God is already at work in the world, and the church is called to join him. As Lesslie Newbigin notes, "Mission is not simply the self-propagation of the church, on the contrary, the active agent of mission is a power that rules, guides, and goes before the church: the free, sovereign, living power of the Spirit of God." The kingdom of God is prior to, and also beyond, the church. It is God's rule and sovereignty over the entire universe.

**The Image of God (Imago Dei)**: Every human being bears the image of God, which means that every person has value, dignity, and the capacity for relationship with God. This means that we can find "shards of heaven's kaleidoscope" in every human soul, recognizing the image of God even in those who don't yet know him.

**The Great Commission**: The Great Commission calls us to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). This requires understanding different cultures, learning their languages, appreciating their rhythms, and adapting methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel. It requires cultural engagement that is both respectful and transformative.

**Paul's Approach**: Paul's approach to cultural engagement provides a model. In Acts 17, when Paul addresses the Athenians, he doesn't start by condemning their culture but by finding points of connection—the altar to an unknown god, their poets, their philosophers. He engages their culture, understands their questions, and then connects them to the gospel.

This theological foundation underscores that cultural engagement is not a human invention but a divine calling, rooted in the very nature of God and the pattern of God's engagement with the world.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements that have had transformative impact have engaged culture missionally, understanding it, engaging it, and reframing it in light of the gospel.

**The Early Church**: The early church engaged culture missionally, adapting to different contexts while maintaining core identity. It learned the languages, understood the questions, and connected the gospel to the deepest longings of each culture. It didn't impose a foreign culture but became native to each context.

**The Celtic Movement**: The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe engaged culture missionally, adapting to different contexts while maintaining core identity. It learned the languages, understood the questions, and connected the gospel to the deepest longings of each culture. It became native to each context rather than remaining foreign.

**The Jesuits**: The Jesuit movement engaged culture missionally, learning languages, understanding questions, and adapting methods to each context. They became native to each culture they served, engaging deeply rather than superficially.

**The Moravians**: The Moravian movement engaged culture missionally, learning languages, understanding questions, and adapting methods to each context. They became native to each culture they served, engaging deeply rather than superficially.

**Contemporary Movements**: Contemporary movements that are experiencing transformation engage culture missionally, understanding it, engaging it, and reframing it in light of the gospel. They learn the languages, understand the questions, and connect the gospel to the deepest longings of each culture.

Conversely, movements that have failed to engage culture missionally have declined. When churches remain foreign to their contexts, when they fail to understand culture, when they impose foreign forms rather than becoming native, they lose their transformative power.

The pattern is clear: movements that engage culture missionally thrive, movements that fail to engage culture decline. Cultural engagement is not optional but essential for movements to form and multiply.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the church faces significant challenges in engaging culture missionally. The pull toward remaining foreign to culture is strong, driven by fear, misunderstanding, and the desire to maintain purity.

The contemporary application requires:

**Learning to Pay Attention**: We must learn the art of paying attention, like Moses at the burning bush. We must notice what God is already doing, where he is already present, and how he is already at work. We must slow down, stop, and notice the burning bushes all around us.

**Learning to Listen**: We must learn the art of listening, understanding what "good news" means to each context. We must listen to people's stories, understand their questions, and learn their language. We must stop talking about ourselves and start listening to others.

**Practicing Interpathy**: We must practice "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy that allows us to climb into another's skin and walk around in it. We must understand people's pain, their longings, their questions, and their hopes. We must feel what they feel, see what they see, and understand what they understand.

**Becoming Native**: We must become native to our contexts rather than remaining foreign. This means learning the language, understanding the questions, appreciating the rhythms, and adapting methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel. It means moving into the neighborhood and living there, not just visiting.

**Finding What God Is Already Doing**: We must find what God is already doing and join him there. We don't bring God with us; he's already there, waiting for us to become aware enough to show up. We must recognize prevenient grace, finding where God is already at work and joining him.

**Connecting Longings to the Gospel**: We must understand universal human desires and connect them to the gospel. When we understand people's longings for justice, spirituality, relationship, beauty, and meaning, we can connect them to the gospel in ways that resonate deeply.

**Living In/Credible Lives**: We must live "in/credible" lives that make others want to say "I'll have what they're having." This involves becoming "theological persons" whose lives bespeak theology, living "questionable lives" that arouse curiosity and invite questions.

**Participating in Tikkun Olam**: We must participate in "tikkun olam"—repairing the world—as a way to join Jesus' mission of restoration. This means engaging in justice, mercy, and love, showing the gospel through action as well as word.

The contemporary application requires churches to resist the pull toward remaining foreign to culture and instead embrace cultural engagement that enables the gospel to take root and flourish.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of cultural engagement connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Anthropology**: The study of culture provides insights into how to understand and engage different cultures. The work on cultural anthropology shows how to read culture, understand its symbols, and engage authentically. The work on cross-cultural communication shows how to communicate effectively across cultural boundaries.

**Sociology**: The study of society provides insights into how culture functions and how to engage it. The work on social networks shows how relationships enable cultural engagement. The work on subcultures shows how to engage different groups within a larger culture.

**Communication Theory**: The study of communication shows how messages must be adapted to each context. The work on cross-cultural communication shows how to communicate effectively. The work on narrative shows how stories are more powerful than propositions.

**Theology**: The study of contextual theology shows how theology must be developed in each context. The work on missional theology shows how mission requires cultural engagement. The work on the incarnation shows how God engages culture.

**Psychology**: The study of human behavior provides insights into understanding people's longings and questions. The work on empathy shows how to understand others. The work on cultural psychology shows how culture shapes thinking and behavior.

**Leadership Studies**: The study of leadership shows how leaders must understand and engage culture. The work on adaptive leadership shows how leaders must adapt to different contexts. The work on cultural intelligence shows how to engage effectively across cultures.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how cultural engagement functions as both spiritual calling and practical skill for mission.

## Practical Implications

The theme of cultural engagement has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must engage culture missionally, understanding it, engaging it, and reframing it in light of the gospel. This means learning to pay attention, learning to listen, and practicing interpathy. Churches must become native to their contexts rather than remaining foreign, finding what God is already doing and joining him there.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model cultural engagement, demonstrating how to understand, engage, and reframe culture missionally. Leaders must create environments where cultural engagement can flourish, providing frameworks and practices that enable missional engagement with culture. Leaders must recognize that you cannot lead where you will not go; you cannot teach what you do not know.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to cultural engagement, learning to pay attention, listen, and practice interpathy. This means understanding the culture we're called to reach, engaging it authentically, and connecting the gospel to people's deepest longings. Disciples must become native to their contexts rather than remaining foreign.

**Specific Applications**:
- Learn the art of paying attention (like Moses at the burning bush)
- Learn the art of listening (understanding what "good news" means to each context)
- Practice interpathy (deep cross-cultural empathy)
- Become native to your context rather than remaining foreign

- Move beyond "speed dating evangelism" to deep, loving relationships
- Recognize prevenient grace and join God where he's already at work

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we engage culture without accommodating it?** Cultural engagement requires understanding and adapting, but how do we do this without compromising the gospel? How do we become native without losing our identity?

**How do we find what God is already doing?** Prevenient grace is everywhere, but how do we recognize it? How do we pay attention in ways that enable us to see what God is doing?

**How do we listen well?** Listening is essential, but how do we do it well? How do we understand what "good news" means to each context?

**How do we practice interpathy?** Interpathy is essential, but how do we develop it? How do we climb into another's skin and walk around in it?

**How do we become native without losing our identity?** Becoming native is essential, but how do we do this while maintaining fidelity to the gospel? How do we adapt without compromising?

**How do we connect longings to the gospel?** Understanding longings is essential, but how do we connect them to the gospel in ways that resonate? How do we avoid imposing our own agenda?

**How do we live in/credible lives?** Living in/credible lives is essential, but how do we do this authentically? How do we become "theological persons" whose lives bespeak theology?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to engage culture missionally in contemporary contexts.
