# Understanding mDNA: The Six Essential Elements

**Pillar Topic:** [Apostolic Genius](/pillar-pages/apostolic-genius-pillar)

## Connection to Pillar

This cluster content provides a deep dive into each of the six essential elements that constitute Movement DNA (mDNA), which is the foundational framework for understanding Apostolic Genius. While the pillar page provides an overview of mDNA as a system, this piece explores each element in detail, helping readers understand not just what each element is, but how it functions within the larger system.

## The Six Elements Explored

### 1. Jesus is Lord: The Central Confession

This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that gives meaning and coherence to everything else. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems, but this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord.

The confession "Jesus is Lord" represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema Yisrael ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"). It touches on the nature of God, his relation to the world, and his covenantal relationship with his people. This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether Caesar, consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Simple enough to transfer from person to person
- Profound enough to transform entire cultures
- Political, revolutionary, and missional in nature
- Demands total allegiance, reshaping every dimension of life

### 2. Disciple-Making: Multiplication Through Formation

Discipleship is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. Movements grow through the multiplication of disciples who embody and pass on the faith, rather than through programs or institutions. This element ensures that the movement's DNA is transmitted from person to person, generation to generation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Focuses on making disciples who make disciples
- Emphasizes embodiment rather than information transfer
- Creates multiplication through reproduction
- Integrates mission and formation inseparably

### 3. Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Going Out and Going Deep

This element represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

**Missional (Going Out):**
- Outward thrust, sending nature
- We go to them rather than expecting them to come to us
- Seeds scattered by the wind, spreading gospel DNA

**Incarnational (Going Deep):**
- Deep identification with culture
- Becoming native rather than foreign
- Six practices: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, Proclamation

### 4. APEST Culture: The Fivefold Ministry Environment

APEST represents the fivefold ministry functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. These are not just leadership roles but forms of organizational intelligence that enable the church to function with full capacity.

**Key Characteristics:**
- All five functions needed simultaneously
- Should be distributed throughout the body, not just in leadership
- Creates dynamic tension between change agents (APE) and stabilizers (ST)
- Enables the church to attain "fullness of Christ"

### 5. Organic Systems: Movemental Structures

Organic systems represent how movements organize themselves in ways consistent with living organisms rather than machines. They are self-organizing, adaptive, reproducible, fractal, and networked.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Simple rules guide behavior
- Common language carries meaning
- Reproducible practices can be passed on
- Distributed leadership throughout the system

### 6. Communitas: Liminal Community

Communitas is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences—threshold experiences outside normal structures and routines. It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Forms through shared mission and risk
- Emerges in liminal spaces (the edge, the threshold)
- Characterized by purpose over comfort
- Essential for authentic missional engagement

## How the Elements Work Together

The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate.

The elements work together dynamically:
- **Jesus is Lord** provides the foundation and center
- **Disciple-Making** creates multiplication and transmission
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** sends the movement outward and deep
- **APEST Culture** provides the ministry environment for full expression
- **Organic Systems** enable reproduction and scaling
- **Communitas** creates the community that sustains mission

Apostolic Genius emerges when all six elements are present and functioning together. It is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges.

*Understanding each element of mDNA is essential, but remember: they work together as a system. Don't try to activate Apostolic Genius by enhancing individual elements in isolation. Address the system as a whole, ensuring all six elements are present and functioning together.*
