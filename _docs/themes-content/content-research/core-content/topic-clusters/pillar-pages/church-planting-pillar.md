# Church Planting: Comprehensive Guide

## Topic Overview

Church planting is not just about starting new churches—it's about extending the mission of God into new contexts, reproducing the DNA of the gospel, and creating movements that transform communities and cultures. When done movementally, church planting becomes the primary way the church reproduces itself, scales its impact, and maintains its missional edge.

But here's the critical distinction: there's a world of difference between planting churches and planting movements. Most church planting focuses on reproducing ecclesial forms—the same structures, programs, and approaches in a new location. Movemental planting focuses on reproducing DNA—the gospel, discipleship, mission, and the essential elements of movement DNA (mDNA) that enable transformation.

Movemental planting recognizes that we're not just planting churches—we're planting the gospel, planting movements, planting the kingdom of God. The goal is not to replicate an institutional form but to release Apostolic Genius in new contexts, allowing it to take shape organically according to the needs and culture of each place.

This approach requires a fundamental shift: from addition (one church becomes two) to multiplication (every part can reproduce); from control (replicating our exact model) to release (trusting the DNA to adapt); from programs (transferring our methods) to principles (embedding core DNA); from institutional thinking (building organizations) to movemental thinking (releasing organisms).

When church planting operates movementally, it becomes exponential rather than linear. It creates networks of communities that reproduce, adapt, and impact their contexts. It extends the mission of God into places we could never reach on our own. It becomes the way the church scales while maintaining its core identity.

## Core Concepts and Frameworks

### Movemental vs. Institutional Planting

**Institutional Planting**:
- Focuses on reproducing ecclesial forms
- Requires significant resources and expertise
- Creates dependency on sending church
- Grows through addition (one becomes two)
- Maintains control over models and methods
- Prioritizes replication of structures

**Movemental Planting**:
- Focuses on reproducing DNA and gospel
- Can happen with minimal resources
- Creates independent, reproducing communities
- Grows through multiplication (every part reproduces)
- Releases control, trusts the DNA
- Prioritizes principles over programs

### Planting the Gospel, Not Just Churches

Movemental planting recognizes that we're planting the gospel itself—the good news of Jesus Christ—and trusting it to take root and grow in ways appropriate to each context. This means:
- Focusing on gospel proclamation and demonstration
- Embedding movement DNA (all six elements)
- Allowing forms to emerge organically
- Contextualizing for each unique culture and place
- Trusting the Holy Spirit to shape the community

### The Role of mDNA in Planting

All six elements of movement DNA must be embedded from the beginning:
- **Jesus is Lord**: The central confession that shapes everything
- **Disciple-Making**: The primary activity that creates multiplication
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Going out and going deep in context
- **APEST Culture**: Fivefold ministry environment that enables full expression
- **Organic Systems**: Movemental structures that allow reproduction
- **Communitas**: Liminal community that forms through shared mission

When all six elements are present, Apostolic Genius can activate, creating a movemental church that reproduces naturally.

### Reproduction Patterns

Movemental planting operates on reproduction at multiple levels:

**Macro Reproduction**: Planting new churches, starting new networks, launching new movements. This is the visible, large-scale multiplication.

**Micro Reproduction**: Every believer making disciples in their sphere of influence. This creates saturation and depth.

**Both are essential**: Macro creates scale; micro creates saturation. Together they create exponential growth.

### Organic vs. Programmatic Approaches

**Programmatic Approach**:
- Transfers methods and structures
- Requires expertise and resources
- Creates dependency
- Focuses on replication
- Tries to control outcomes

**Organic Approach**:
- Embeds principles and DNA
- Can happen with minimal resources
- Creates independence
- Focuses on adaptation
- Trusts the system to work

### Contextualization in Planting

Movemental planting requires deep contextualization—becoming native to each context rather than remaining foreign. This means:
- Learning the culture, language, and context
- Understanding what "good news" means in that place
- Adapting forms while maintaining DNA
- Engaging incarnationally (presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, proclamation)
- Allowing the gospel to take shape appropriately

## Historical Development

Church planting has been central to the spread of Christianity:

**The Early Church**: The apostles and early Christians planted churches throughout the Roman Empire, creating networks of communities that reproduced rapidly. Their approach was movemental—reproducing the gospel and allowing forms to adapt to each context.

**Missionary Movements**: Throughout history, missionary movements have planted churches in new cultures and contexts. The most effective have been those that contextualized deeply while maintaining core DNA.

**Renewal Movements**: Various renewal movements have planted new expressions of church, often recovering forgotten aspects of movement DNA in the process.

**Contemporary Movements**: In recent decades, there's been growing emphasis on church planting, with various approaches emerging. The movemental approach represents a recovery of organic, DNA-focused planting.

**The House Church Movement**: Has demonstrated that church planting can happen with minimal resources when focused on reproducing DNA rather than structures.

## Contemporary Application

Today, movemental planting is essential for churches seeking exponential impact:

**1. From Addition to Multiplication**: Shift from thinking "we'll plant one church" to "we'll plant movements that plant movements." Think multiplication, not addition.

**2. From Forms to DNA**: Focus on embedding movement DNA rather than transferring institutional forms. Trust the DNA to take appropriate shape in each context.

**3. From Programs to Principles**: Transfer reproducible principles rather than complex programs. Create systems anyone can run, not systems that require experts.

**4. From Control to Release**: Release control over models and methods. Trust the DNA, trust the Holy Spirit, trust the people. Create independence, not dependency.

**5. From Resources to Reproduction**: Don't wait for perfect conditions or significant resources. Movemental planting can happen with minimal resources when focused on DNA and principles.

**6. From Isolation to Networks**: Plant in networks rather than isolation. Create connections that enable mutual support while maintaining independence.

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started with Movemental Planting

**1. Assess Your DNA**
- Do you have all six mDNA elements functioning?
- Are you reproducing movementally or institutionally?
- Can you articulate your core DNA clearly?
- Are you living movementally before trying to plant?

**2. Identify Planters**
- Look for people with apostolic gifting
- Find those who understand and embody mDNA
- Identify people already reproducing (making disciples)
- Choose those who can work with minimal resources

**3. Embed DNA from the Start**
- Ensure all six mDNA elements are present from the beginning
- Don't wait to add them later—they must be foundational
- Create culture that values and expresses all elements
- Develop leaders who understand and can reproduce DNA

**4. Train in Principles, Not Programs**
- Teach movement DNA and principles
- Help planters understand contextualization
- Develop reproducible practices, not complex programs
- Focus on multiplication strategies

**5. Release and Support**
- Release control—don't try to manage from a distance
- Provide support through relationships and networks
- Create accountability through DNA, not hierarchy
- Celebrate reproduction and multiplication

### Common Challenges

**Institutional Thinking**: It's natural to think institutionally. Stay focused on movemental principles and DNA.

**Control Mentality**: Leaders often struggle to release control. Trust the DNA, trust the planters, trust the Holy Spirit.

**Resource Dependency**: Don't make resource requirements a barrier. Movemental planting can happen with minimal resources.

**Form Replication**: It's easier to replicate forms than embed DNA. Stay focused on principles and DNA.

**Contextualization**: Finding the balance between maintaining DNA and contextualizing appropriately. This requires wisdom and discernment.

*Church planting is not just about starting new churches—it's about extending the mission of God, reproducing the DNA of the gospel, and creating movements that transform communities. When we plant movementally rather than institutionally, we discover that reproduction is not a burden but a gift, multiplication is not impossible but natural, and exponential impact is not a dream but a possibility. The question is not whether to plant—we must. The question is how—movementally or institutionally, focusing on DNA or forms, releasing or controlling.*
