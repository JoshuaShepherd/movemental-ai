# Discipleship: Comprehensive Guide

## Topic Overview

Discipleship is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. He did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs—he made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was the foundational strategy from which the church would emerge.

But here's the thing: discipleship is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move. It is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making. Discipleship is not an optional extra for the committed few; it is the non-negotiable core practice of the church.

Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us. Discipleship means learning to think, feel, and act like Jesus—not just knowing about him but knowing him and being known by him in the most intimate sense.

A critical insight I developed in *Disciplism* is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

## Core Concepts and Frameworks

### Disciplism: Reframing Evangelism

The term "disciplism" suggests that discipleship should be the "ism" that shapes our approach—not evangelism as a separate activity, but disciplism as the comprehensive framework. The key insight is "begin with the end in mind"—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start.

Evangelism, worship, community, and mission all serve the larger purpose of making disciples who can make disciples. Evangelism happens naturally within the disciple-making process, not as a separate activity that precedes it. Jesus' ministry demonstrates that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end.

### The mDNA of Discipleship

Authentic disciple-making involves several key elements:

**1. Jesus-Shaped Discipleship**: Centered on Christ's person and example. Discipleship is not about following a program but about following a person—Jesus himself. We learn from him, model our lives on him, and let him live through us.

**2. Shema Spirituality**: Loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. Discipleship engages the whole person—affections, emotions, intellect, and will. It's not just about knowledge but about wholehearted devotion.

**3. The Inseparability of Mission and Discipleship**: You cannot have one without the other. Discipleship without mission becomes self-focused and sterile. Mission without discipleship becomes shallow and unsustainable. They belong together.

**4. The Prophetic Call to Faithfulness**: Discipleship requires radical obedience. It's not about convenience but about covenant. It demands that we take up our cross daily and follow Jesus, even when it's costly.

### Obstacles to Authentic Discipleship

*Untamed* explores obstacles to authentic discipleship in three areas:

**1. Theological Obstacles**: False images of God and Jesus that create barriers to authentic following. When we misunderstand who God is, we can't truly follow him. We need accurate, biblical understanding of God's character and Jesus' nature.

**2. Cultural Obstacles**: The subverting influence of consumerism, money, and status. Middle-class culture, with its focus on security, consumption, and risk-aversion, functions as an "anti-missional virus" that gradually erodes authentic discipleship and replaces it with consumeristic Christianity.

**3. Personal Obstacles**: Issues of identity, sexuality, and family that create resistance to wholehearted discipleship. We all have areas where we struggle to let Jesus be Lord, areas where we want to maintain control.

### The Multiplication Principle

Discipleship in movements operates on multiplication, not addition. The goal is not just to make disciples but to make disciples who make disciples who make disciples. This is how movements grow exponentially. Each disciple becomes a potential multiplier, passing on the DNA of faith to others.

This requires:
- Disciples who understand they are called to make disciples
- Reproducible processes and practices
- Environments that encourage multiplication
- Leaders who model disciple-making

### Discipleship and the Cross

One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning. Discipleship is not about making Christianity easy or attractive; it's about calling people to follow Jesus, which always involves taking up the cross. This doesn't mean we make it unnecessarily difficult, but it does mean we're honest about the cost of discipleship.

## Historical Development

Discipleship has been central to Christian movements throughout history:

**Jesus' Ministry**: Jesus' entire approach was built around selecting and developing disciples. He spent three years with twelve men, investing deeply in their formation. This was his primary strategy.

**The Early Church**: The early church continued this pattern, with more experienced believers mentoring newer believers. The pattern of making disciples who make disciples enabled the rapid spread of the gospel.

**Monastic Movements**: Created intensive discipleship environments where people could grow in holiness and mission. The monastic tradition emphasized formation through community, prayer, study, and service.

**The Moravian Movement**: Emphasized discipleship within community, creating what they called "choirs" where people of similar age and stage could grow together in discipleship and mission.

**Contemporary Recovery**: In recent decades, there's been growing recognition that the church has lost focus on discipleship. Various movements have sought to recover intentional, relational, reproducible disciple-making.

**Disciplism Development**: The disciplism framework emerged from recognizing that we need to reframe evangelism within discipleship rather than trying to add discipleship to an evangelism-focused approach.

## Contemporary Application

Today, recovering authentic discipleship is essential for church health and mission effectiveness:

**1. Begin with the End in Mind**: If the goal is making disciples, orient everything toward that goal. Evangelism, worship, community, mission—all serve disciple-making.

**2. Make Discipleship the Primary Activity**: Discipleship should not be one program among many; it should be the organizing principle for everything the church does.

**3. Focus on Multiplication**: Build disciple-making systems that reproduce. Create processes that anyone can learn and pass on. Develop environments that encourage multiplication.

**4. Engage the Whole Person**: Discipleship involves heart, soul, mind, and strength. Don't reduce it to information transfer. Create experiences and relationships that form the whole person.

**5. Integrate Mission and Discipleship**: Don't separate them. Mission provides context for discipleship; discipleship provides depth for mission. They belong together.

**6. Address Obstacles**: Recognize and address theological, cultural, and personal obstacles to authentic discipleship. Create environments that help people overcome these barriers.

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started with Disciplism

**1. Assess Current State**
- How would you describe your current approach to evangelism and discipleship?
- Are they integrated or separate?
- Is discipleship the primary focus, or is it an add-on?
- Are you seeing multiplication, or just addition?

**2. Reframe the Approach**
- Begin with the end in mind: making disciples
- Position evangelism within the disciple-making process
- Create pathways that start with relationship and lead to discipleship
- Don't separate conversion from formation

**3. Develop Reproducible Processes**
- Create simple, reproducible practices
- Develop processes that anyone can learn and pass on
- Avoid dependency on experts or complex programs
- Focus on relationships and practices that can multiply

**4. Create Discipleship Environments**
- Form communities where discipleship happens naturally
- Create spaces for intentional mentoring and growth
- Build cultures that value and celebrate disciple-making
- Develop leaders who model disciple-making

**5. Address Obstacles**
- Identify theological, cultural, and personal obstacles
- Create resources and environments that help people overcome barriers
- Be honest about the cost of discipleship while making it accessible
- Help people understand what it means to follow Jesus

### Common Challenges

**Consumerism**: Our culture trains people to be consumers, not disciples. This requires intentional counter-cultural formation.

**Time and Investment**: Discipleship takes time and relational investment. It's not quick or easy. This requires patience and commitment.

**Reproduction**: Many discipleship approaches create dependency rather than multiplication. Focus on making disciples who can make disciples.

**Integration**: It's easier to separate evangelism and discipleship than to integrate them. This requires rethinking our categories and processes.

**Measurement**: Discipleship is harder to measure than attendance or conversions. Develop metrics that capture depth and multiplication.

*Discipleship is not an optional add-on to Christianity—it is Christianity. We are all disciples in the making, called to follow Jesus with our whole being and to make disciples who make disciples. When we recover authentic discipleship, we discover that it is the foundation for everything else—mission, community, transformation, and multiplication. The question is not whether discipleship matters—it does. The question is whether we're willing to make it the primary thing, to begin with the end in mind, and to invest in the long, slow work of making disciples who can make disciples.*
