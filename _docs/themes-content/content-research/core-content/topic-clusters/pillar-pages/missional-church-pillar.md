# Missional Church: Comprehensive Guide

## Topic Overview

What does it mean to be a missional church? Is it simply another church model or program? Or does it represent something far more fundamental—a rediscovery of the church's true nature and purpose?

A missional church is one that understands itself as sent—not just occasionally, not just through special programs, but as its essential identity. Mission is not something the church does; it's something the church is. This understanding flows from the missio Dei—the sending of God. Just as the Father sent the Son, and the Father and Son sent the Spirit, so the church is sent into the world to participate in God's mission of restoration and redemption.

The missional church stands in contrast to what I call the "attractional" church model, which operates on the assumption that people will come to us if we make our services appealing enough. The missional model recognizes that we must go to them, becoming incarnate in their contexts, speaking their language, entering their world. We don't invite people to come and see; we go and show—living as demonstrations of God's kingdom in every sphere of life.

But being missional isn't just about going out—it's also about going deep. The missional-incarnational impulse has two dimensions: missional (going out) and incarnational (going deep). We scatter seeds of the gospel into new contexts (missional), and we burrow into culture, becoming native rather than foreign (incarnational). These twin movements characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world.

Why does this matter? Because the world has changed. The era when the church could assume cultural privilege is over. In the West, we find ourselves in what some call a post-Christian context. The old methods—attractional services, mass evangelism, programmatic approaches—still work in some contexts, but they're increasingly ineffective for engaging people who don't share our assumptions, our language, or our cultural location.

The missional church recognizes that the gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation. It understands that the church is intrinsically incarnational—it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. It sees mission not as a department but as the DNA of the community itself.

## Core Concepts and Frameworks

### Missio Dei: The Mission of God

At the heart of missional theology lies the concept of missio Dei—the mission of God. This is not our mission that we ask God to bless; it's God's mission that we are invited to join. The missio Dei is the eternal purpose of God to restore and heal creation, to reconcile all things to himself through Christ.

This understanding changes everything. Mission doesn't start with us; it starts with God. We don't create mission; we participate in it. The church exists as a missionary people because God is a missionary God. This is not optional—it's who we are.

### The Missional-Incarnational Impulse

The missional church operates with what I call the "missional-incarnational impulse," one of the six essential elements of movement DNA (mDNA). This impulse has two dimensions:

**Missional (Going Out)**: The outward thrust, the sending nature. Mission is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. This can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts.

**Incarnational (Going Deep)**: The deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

### The Six Practices of Incarnational Mission

Incarnational mission involves six key practices:

1. **Presence**: Full identification with culture, being fully present in context
2. **Proximity**: Geographic and relational closeness to those we're called to serve
3. **Powerlessness**: Humility and vulnerability, not leveraging power or privilege
4. **Prevenience**: Recognizing God's work already present in culture and people
5. **Passion**: Embracing redemptive suffering for the sake of mission
6. **Proclamation**: Sharing the good news in word as well as deed

### Four Movements Framework

From *Fast Forward to Mission*, a practical framework for everyday mission:

- **Move Out**: Into missional engagement, crossing boundaries and barriers
- **Move In**: Burrowing into culture through incarnation, becoming native
- **Move Alongside**: Engaging in relationships and community, walking with people
- **Move From**: Challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture with prophetic voice

### Attractional vs. Missional

The missional church understands that the attractional model (come and see) works well in contexts where people are already open to Christianity (what I call m0-m1 on the missional scale). But when significant cultural barriers exist (m2-m4), the missional-incarnational approach becomes essential. The gospel must be translated, contextualized, and embodied in ways that make sense to each unique cultural context.

## Historical Development

The concept of "missional church" emerged in the late 20th century as theologians and practitioners recognized that the church needed to rethink its relationship to mission. Key developments include:

**The Missio Dei Movement (1950s-1960s)**: Theologians like Karl Barth, Karl Hartenstein, and others began emphasizing that mission belongs to God, not just to mission agencies. This theological shift laid the foundation for missional thinking.

**Lesslie Newbigin's Return to England (1974)**: When Newbigin returned from India to England, he found a post-Christian context that required a fundamentally different approach to mission. His writings, particularly *The Open Secret* and *The Gospel in a Pluralist Society*, influenced a generation of missional thinkers.

**The Gospel and Our Culture Network (1980s-1990s)**: This network brought together theologians and practitioners exploring what it means to be the church in Western post-Christian contexts.

**Contemporary Missional Movement (2000s-present)**: Building on these foundations, contemporary missional thinkers have developed practical frameworks, models, and approaches for missional church life.

The missional church conversation recognizes that we're not just talking about a new model or strategy but about recovering the church's fundamental nature as a sent people. The early church was inherently missional—it existed as a counter-cultural community that lived and proclaimed the gospel in the midst of an unreached world.

## Contemporary Application

Today, the missional church framework is more relevant than ever. The Western church finds itself in contexts that increasingly resemble the early church—cultural marginalization, loss of privilege, the need to engage people who don't share our assumptions.

**Key Contemporary Applications:**

**1. Everyday Mission**: Mission is not reserved for special events or professional missionaries. Every believer is sent into their sphere of influence—workplace, neighborhood, social networks, family. The missional church equips and releases all people for mission in everyday life.

**2. Contextual Engagement**: The missional church practices what I call "romancing the city"—developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This involves the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy.

**3. Incarnational Presence**: Rather than extracting people from their contexts, the missional church sends people to be good news within their contexts. This might mean starting communities in coffee shops, workplaces, neighborhoods, or other third spaces.

**4. Cultural Translation**: The missional church recognizes that the gospel must be translated for each new generation and cultural context. This isn't about changing the message but about making it intelligible and compelling to those who haven't heard it.

**5. Missional Communities**: Many missional churches organize around smaller, dispersed communities that engage specific neighborhoods, networks, or people groups. These communities live missionally in their contexts while maintaining connection to the larger body.

## Practical Implementation

### Getting Started: First Steps

**1. Shift from Attractional to Missional Mindset**
- Reframe success from "how many come" to "how many are sent"
- Shift resources from facilities and programs to mission and mobilization
- Change language from "inviting people to church" to "being the church in the world"

**2. Equip All People for Mission**
- Help people identify their mission fields (where they already have relationships)
- Provide training in evangelism, cultural engagement, and incarnational practices
- Create structures that support and celebrate missional engagement

**3. Practice Incarnational Presence**
- Encourage people to be fully present in their contexts
- Model the six practices: presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, proclamation
- Create opportunities for people to engage missionally in everyday life

**4. Develop Missional Communities**
- Form smaller communities organized around mission (neighborhoods, networks, people groups)
- Empower these communities to engage their contexts missionally
- Maintain connection and shared identity across dispersed communities

### Common Challenges

**Maintaining Balance**: The missional-incarnational impulse is one of the most easily suppressed elements of mDNA. Churches often revert to attractional patterns because they're more comfortable and measurable. Stay committed to the missional approach even when it's challenging.

**Cultural Engagement Without Compromise**: Being incarnational means entering culture deeply, but not uncritically. We must learn to engage culture with both affirmation and challenge—celebrating what's good, redeeming what's broken, challenging what's dehumanizing.

**Measuring Success**: Missional engagement is often harder to measure than attendance and giving. Develop new metrics: stories of transformation, missional engagement, community impact, disciples made.

**Leadership Development**: Missional churches need leaders who model and multiply missional engagement. Invest in developing leaders who can equip others for mission.

*The missional church is not a new model to adopt but an identity to recover. We are sent people, called to participate in God's mission of restoring all things. This isn't a program—it's who we are. And when we live into this identity, we discover that mission is not a burden but a gift, not an obligation but an invitation to join what God is already doing in the world.*
