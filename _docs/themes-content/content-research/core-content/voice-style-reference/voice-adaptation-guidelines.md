# Voice Adaptation Guidelines

*Guidelines for adapting voice across content types, audiences, and contexts while maintaining authenticity*

---

## Introduction

While Alan Hirsch's voice has consistent characteristics, it adapts appropriately across different content types, audiences, and contexts. This document provides guidelines for maintaining authentic voice while adapting to specific needs.

Voice adaptation is not about changing core characteristics but about emphasizing different aspects, adjusting tone, and selecting appropriate patterns for different contexts. The goal is always to maintain authenticity while serving the specific purpose and audience.

## Voice Adaptation by Content Type

### Definitions

**Voice Characteristics to Emphasize:**
