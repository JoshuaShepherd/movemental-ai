# Integrated Framework Applications: Using Multiple Frameworks Together in Practice

## Overview

This guide shows how multiple frameworks work together in real-world applications, providing examples and patterns of integrated framework use. Rather than using frameworks in isolation, these applications demonstrate comprehensive approaches that leverage multiple frameworks simultaneously.

**Why This Matters:** Real transformation and movement activation require multiple frameworks working together. Isolated framework use leads to limited impact. Integrated applications show how frameworks reinforce each other.

**How to Use This Guide:** Study the applications to see frameworks working together. Adapt patterns to your context. Use applications as models for your own integrated approaches.

## Application 1: Church Planting Movement (mDNA + APEST + Disciplism + Movement Dynamics)

**Context:** Planting churches that become movements

**Integrated Approach:**

1. **Embed mDNA from Launch**
   - Establish "Jesus is Lord" as absolute center
   - Begin disciple-making immediately (even pre-conversion)
   - Create missional-incarnational impulse from day one
   - Build APEST culture (all five functions present)
   - Design organic systems (distributed, networked)
   - Create communitas through shared mission

2. **Develop APEST Leadership Team**
   - Identify which functions are present in planters
   - Ensure all five functions represented (across team if needed)
   - Create apostle-prophet partnerships for foundation
   - Distribute functions throughout community, not just leaders

3. **Establish Disciplism as Primary Framework**
   - Make disciple-making the core practice
   - Embed evangelism within discipleship
   - Ensure formation begins before conversion
   - Create multiplication pathways

4. **Design for Movement Dynamics**
   - Build reproduction into DNA from start
   - Create network connections, not isolation
   - Enable multiplication, not just addition
   - Support organic growth

**Frameworks Reinforcing Each Other:**
- APEST enables mDNA elements to function
- Disciplism ensures mDNA is embodied
- Organic systems allow movement dynamics
- Movement dynamics emerge when system activates

**Outcome:** Churches planted with movemental DNA, all functions operating, multiplication built in, reproducing communities

## Application 2: Megachurch Transition (Metanoia + mDNA + Paradigm-Platform-Practices + APEST)

**Context:** Large church transitioning from attractional to missional movement

**Integrated Approach:**

1. **Begin Metanoia Journey**
   - Acknowledge adaptive challenge (institutional attractional patterns)
   - Create liminality through shared risk and mission
   - Begin downcurve: Unravel attractional assumptions, Uncover system flaws, Unlock movement possibilities, Understand mDNA

2. **Diagnose with mDNA**
   - Assess which elements are present/weak/missing
   - Identify gaps (often APEST truncated to ST, institutional systems, weak communitas)
   - Understand how elements should integrate

3. **Structure Transformation with Paradigm-Platform-Practices**
   - **Paradigm:** Shift from attractional to missional movement thinking
   - **Platform:** Build culture and structures for movement (distributed leadership, organic organization)
   - **Practices:** Develop movemental behaviors (disciple-making, multiplication, mission)

4. **Recover APEST Functions**
   - Assess current function distribution (usually ST-heavy)
   - Activate exiled functions (APE) through metanoia process
   - Embed fivefold intelligence throughout organization
   - Create apostle-prophet-evangelist partnerships

**Frameworks Reinforcing Each Other:**
- Metanoia provides transformation process
- mDNA provides destination and diagnostic
- Paradigm-Platform-Practices structures change comprehensively
- APEST recovery enables system activation

**Outcome:** Transformed organization, movemental capacity, fivefold intelligence recovered, sustainable change

## Application 3: Network Development (Movement Dynamics + mDNA + APEST + Organic Systems)

**Context:** Developing networks of churches/communities into movements

**Integrated Approach:**

1. **Embed mDNA in Each Expression**
   - Provide mDNA assessment for each community
   - Ensure all six elements present in every expression
   - Support weak elements with network resources
   - Maintain "Jesus is Lord" centrality across network

2. **Distribute APEST Functions Across Network**
   - Identify apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers in network
   - Create cross-community partnerships (apostle-prophet teams for new plants)
   - Ensure all functions represented at network level
   - Support function development in each community

3. **Enable Movement Dynamics**
   - Design for multiplication (each community can reproduce)
   - Create network connections (not isolated churches)
   - Build reproduction pathways and support
   - Enable organic growth across network

4. **Build Organic Network Systems**
   - Create distributed leadership (not hierarchical control)
   - Enable network connections and relationships
   - Design simple rules and common language
   - Support organic organization patterns

**Frameworks Reinforcing Each Other:**
- mDNA ensures movement capacity in each community
- APEST enables diverse intelligence at network level
- Organic systems facilitate movement dynamics
- Movement dynamics emerge as network activates

**Outcome:** Reproducing network, diverse capacity distributed, sustainable movement, organic organization

## Application 4: Leadership Development (APEST + Disciplism + Metanoia + Reframation)

**Context:** Developing leaders with full fivefold capacity

**Integrated Approach:**

1. **Assess APEST Capacity**
   - Identify which functions are present/dominant in each leader
   - Identify missing or weak functions
   - Help leaders understand their fivefold profile
   - See how functions work together

2. **Develop Through Disciplism**
   - Embed APEST development in disciple-making
   - Help leaders develop all five functions (even non-dominant ones)
   - Create disciple-making pathways that activate fivefold
   - Ensure formation precedes or accompanies skill development

3. **Enable Transformation Through Metanoia**
   - Help leaders unlearn limiting assumptions about leadership
   - Relearn leadership as fivefold ministry, not just management
   - Transform from hierarchical to distributed leadership thinking
   - Personal metanoia journey for each leader

4. **Renew Vision Through Reframation**
   - Develop "soft eyes" to see fivefold everywhere
   - Help leaders recognize APEST as universal archetypes
   - Re-enchant vision of leadership and ministry
   - See leadership as participation in God's purposes

**Frameworks Reinforcing Each Other:**
- APEST provides the capacity framework
- Disciplism provides the formation framework
- Metanoia enables transformation
- Reframation enables recognition and vision

**Outcome:** Leaders with full fivefold capacity, disciple-makers, transformed vision, multiplied impact

## Application 5: Missional Community Development (Missional-Incarnational + Liminality/Communitas + Organic Systems + Disciplism)

**Context:** Developing missional communities that engage culture deeply

**Integrated Approach:**

1. **Establish Missional-Incarnational Impulse**
   - Develop both sending (missional) and deep engagement (incarnational)
   - Use six practices: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, Proclamation
   - Ensure going out and going deep together
   - Become native to context, not foreign

2. **Create Liminality and Communitas**
   - Engage at edges of society (not just safe spaces)

## Integration Principles Across Applications

### 1. Foundation First

Always establish "Jesus is Lord" as foundation before building other frameworks.

### 2. Diagnostic Before Prescriptive

Use diagnostic frameworks (like mDNA) before applying solutions.

### 3. Comprehensive Integration

Don't use frameworks in isolation—integrate them for comprehensive change.

### 4. Systemic Thinking

See frameworks as parts of systems, not isolated tools.

### 5. Embodiment Required

Frameworks must be embodied in people and practices, not just understood.

### 6. Contextual Adaptation

Adapt integrated approaches to specific contexts while maintaining principles.
