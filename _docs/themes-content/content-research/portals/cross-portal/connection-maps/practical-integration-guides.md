# Practical Integration Guides: Using Multiple Concepts and Frameworks in Real Ministry

## Overview

This guide provides practical, step-by-step approaches for integrating multiple concepts, themes, and frameworks in real ministry contexts. Rather than applying concepts in isolation, these guides show how to use them together for comprehensive transformation and movement activation.

**Why This Matters:** Leaders often know individual concepts but struggle with integration. This guide provides practical pathways for using concepts and frameworks together in specific ministry situations.

**How to Use This Guide:** Select the integration pattern that matches your situation. Follow the steps, adapting to your context. Use multiple patterns together as needed.

## Integration Pattern 1: New Church Plant (mDNA + APEST + Disciplism)

**Context:** Starting a new church or missional community

**Steps:**
1. **Embed mDNA from the start**
   - Establish "Jesus is Lord" as absolute center
   - Begin disciple-making immediately (even before people are converted)
   - Create missional-incarnational impulse from day one
   - Build APEST culture (ensure all five functions present)
   - Design organic systems (distributed, networked)
   - Create communitas through shared mission and risk

2. **Develop APEST leadership**
   - Identify which functions are present in team
   - Ensure all five functions represented (even if in multiple people)
   - Create partnerships (apostle-prophet, evangelist-shepherd)
   - Distribute leadership functions throughout community

3. **Establish Disciplism framework**
   - Make disciple-making the primary framework
   - Embed evangelism within discipleship
   - Ensure formation begins even before conversion
   - Create multiplication pathways (disciples who make disciples)

**Key Integration Points:**
- APEST enables mDNA elements to function
- Disciplism ensures mDNA is embodied in people
- Organic systems allow mDNA to replicate

**Expected Outcomes:** Movemental DNA embedded from start, all functions operating, multiplication capacity built in

## Integration Pattern 2: Existing Church Transformation (Metanoia + mDNA + Paradigm-Platform-Practices)

**Context:** Transforming an existing church toward movement

**Steps:**
1. **Begin Metanoia Journey**
   - Acknowledge adaptive challenge (institutional patterns)
   - Create liminality (threshold experience through shared risk)
   - Begin downcurve: Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand

2. **Diagnose with mDNA**
   - Assess which elements are present/weak/missing
   - Identify specific gaps (often APEST, organic systems, communitas)
   - Understand how elements should work together

3. **Structure transformation with Paradigm-Platform-Practices**
   - **Paradigm:** Shift organizational mind around mDNA
   - **Platform:** Build culture and structures for movement
   - **Practices:** Develop movemental behaviors and rhythms

4. **Continue Metanoia Journey upcurve**
   - **Paradigm:** Articulate new organizational mind
   - **Platform:** Build culture and structures
   - **Practices:** Embed movemental behaviors

**Key Integration Points:**
- Metanoia provides transformation process
- mDNA provides destination (what you're becoming)
- Paradigm-Platform-Practices structures the change

**Expected Outcomes:** Organizational transformation, mDNA activation, movement capacity

## Integration Pattern 3: Leadership Development (APEST + Disciplism + Reframation)

**Context:** Developing leaders with full fivefold capacity

**Steps:**
1. **Assess APEST capacity**
   - Identify which functions are present/dominant
   - Identify missing or weak functions
   - Understand how functions work together

2. **Develop through Disciplism**
   - Embed APEST development in disciple-making
   - Help leaders develop all five functions (even if not dominant)
   - Create disciple-making pathways that activate fivefold

3. **Enable with Reframation**
   - Develop "soft eyes" to see fivefold everywhere
   - Help leaders recognize APEST as universal archetypes
   - Re-enchant vision of leadership and ministry

**Key Integration Points:**
- Disciplism provides the formation framework
- APEST provides the capacity framework
- Reframation enables recognition and recovery

**Expected Outcomes:** Leaders with full fivefold capacity, disciple-makers who develop others, renewed vision

## Integration Pattern 4: Missional Community Development (Missional-Incarnational + Liminality/Communitas + Organic Systems)

**Context:** Developing missional communities that engage culture deeply

**Steps:**
1. **Establish Missional-Incarnational Impulse**
   - Develop sending (missional) and deep engagement (incarnational)
   - Use six practices: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, Proclamation
   - Ensure going out and going deep together

2. **Create Liminality and Communitas**
   - Engage at edges of society
   - Take risks for mission
   - Create shared adventure and challenge
   - Build deep community through shared mission

3. **Design Organic Systems**
   - Create distributed leadership
   - Enable network connections
   - Design for reproduction
   - Build simple rules and common language

**Key Integration Points:**
- Mission creates liminality
- Liminality generates communitas
- Organic systems enable sustainable engagement

**Expected Outcomes:** Deep cultural engagement, authentic community, reproducing communities

## Integration Pattern 5: Network/Movement Development (Movement Dynamics + mDNA + APEST)

**Context:** Developing networks or movements of churches/communities

**Steps:**
1. **Embed mDNA in every expression**
   - Ensure all six elements present in each community
   - Provide mDNA assessment tools
   - Support elements that are weak

2. **Distribute APEST functions**
   - Identify apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, teachers in network
   - Create partnerships across communities
   - Ensure all functions represented at network level

3. **Enable Movement Dynamics**
   - Design for multiplication (not just addition)
   - Create reproduction pathways
   - Build network connections
   - Support organic growth

**Key Integration Points:**
- mDNA ensures movement capacity in each community
- APEST enables diverse intelligence at network level
- Movement Dynamics emerge when system works

**Expected Outcomes:** Reproducing network, diverse capacity, sustainable movement

## General Integration Principles

### 1. Start with Foundation

Always begin with "Jesus is Lord" as the center. All integration must flow from and return to this foundation.

### 2. Diagnose Before Prescribing

Use frameworks (like mDNA) to diagnose before applying solutions. Understand what's missing or weak.

### 3. Think Systemically

Don't apply concepts in isolation. See how they work together as a system.

### 4. Embed, Don't Add

Integration means embedding concepts throughout, not just adding programs. Use Paradigm-Platform-Practices to ensure embedding.

### 5. Maintain Tension

Healthy integration maintains creative tensions (like APE/ST, paradigm/practices). Don't resolve by choosing one over the other.

### 6. Context Matters

Adapt integration patterns to your specific context. The principles apply broadly, but application varies.

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Challenges

### Challenge: Overwhelm

**Problem:** Too many frameworks to integrate feels overwhelming.

**Solution:** 
- Start with one pattern at a time
- Focus on foundational integration first
- Build gradually, don't try to do everything at once

### Challenge: Competing Priorities

**Problem:** Frameworks seem to pull in different directions.

**Solution:**
- Understand that creative tension is healthy
- Use frameworks to balance each other
- See frameworks as complementary, not competing

### Challenge: Surface Integration

**Problem:** Integration feels superficial, not deep.

**Solution:**
- Use Paradigm-Platform-Practices to ensure deep embedding
- Focus on transformation, not just adding concepts
- Give time for integration to take root

### Challenge: Missing Elements

**Problem:** Can't integrate because key elements are missing.

**Solution:**
- Use mDNA to diagnose what's missing
- Use Metanoia Journey to recover lost capacity
- Build foundation before integrating advanced concepts
