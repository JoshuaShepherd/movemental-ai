# Theological Integration Maps: How Concepts Connect to Broader Theological Themes

## Overview

The concepts and frameworks in Alan Hirsch's work don't exist in a theological vacuum—they connect deeply to foundational theological themes: Trinity, Incarnation, Kingdom of God, Church, Mission, and more. Understanding these theological connections helps see how the work is grounded in Christian doctrine and how concepts serve theological purposes.

**Why This Matters:** Concepts can feel like management tools unless connected to their theological foundations. Understanding theological connections reveals the doctrinal depth and helps concepts function as theological frameworks, not just strategies.

**How to Use This Map:** Use this to understand the theological grounding of concepts, to see how concepts serve theological purposes, to ensure concepts are used theologically (not just pragmatically), and to connect concepts to broader theological understanding.

## Major Theological Connections

### 1. Trinity and APEST/5Q

**Theological Foundation:** The fivefold functions reflect the triune nature of God. God's being is relational and diverse, and the church as image of God should reflect this diversity.

**Connection:**
- APEST functions reflect aspects of God's nature and action
- The diversity of functions reflects the diversity within God's unity
- All five functions are needed, just as Father, Son, and Spirit are all essential
- The complementarity of functions reflects the perichoresis (mutual indwelling) of the Trinity

**Theological Implication:** Truncating APEST (to ST) is not just organizational error but theological error—it fails to reflect God's full nature.

**Source Connection:** *5Q*, Chapter 3: "The Traces of God"; *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 2

### 2. Incarnation and Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Theological Foundation:** God became fully human in Jesus Christ, taking on flesh and dwelling among us. This demonstrates how God engages with creation and culture.

**Connection:**
- Incarnation models the deep identification with culture required for mission
- The missional-incarnational impulse is rooted in the missio Dei (sending of God)
- Just as God became native to human culture, the church must become native to its contexts
- The six practices (Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, etc.) reflect aspects of the incarnation

**Theological Implication:** Mission that doesn't engage culture deeply (incarnationally) misunderstands how God works in the world.

### 3. Kingdom of God and Movement Dynamics

**Theological Foundation:** The Kingdom of God is God's reign breaking into the world, transforming all things. It's both present and coming, both here and not yet.

**Connection:**
- Movements are expressions of the Kingdom breaking in
- Movement dynamics (reproduction, multiplication) reflect the Kingdom's expansive nature
- The Kingdom is movemental, not institutional
- Apostolic Genius activates when communities align with Kingdom purposes

**Theological Implication:** Churches that are institutional rather than movemental may be missing the Kingdom's dynamic nature.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, throughout; *On the Verge*, Chapter 4

### 4. Church (Ecclesiology) and mDNA

**Theological Foundation:** The church is the body of Christ, a living organism, the people of God called out for mission.

**Connection:**
- mDNA describes what the church is designed to be (movemental)
- Each element of mDNA reflects essential aspects of the church's nature
- "Jesus is Lord" defines the church's identity
- Organic systems reflect the church as body of Christ (organism, not organization)
- APEST reflects the church as the fullness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13)

**Theological Implication:** mDNA is not an add-on but a description of the church's true nature, often forgotten but recoverable.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, entire book; *Untamed*, Chapter 5

---

### 5. Mission (Missiology) and Missional-Incarnational Impulse

**Theological Foundation:** Mission flows from the missio Dei—God's own mission to restore and heal creation. The church participates in God's mission.

**Connection:**
- Missional-incarnational impulse is participation in missio Dei
- Mission is not an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative
- The impulse reflects both God's sending (missional) and God's embodiment (incarnational)
- Mission requires going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational)

**Theological Implication:** Churches that don't have missional-incarnational impulse aren't fully participating in God's mission.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 6; *Fast Forward to Mission*, entire book

---

### 6. Christology and "Jesus Is Lord"

**Theological Foundation:** Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human, Lord of all, the center of Christian faith and life.

**Connection:**
- "Jesus is Lord" is the foundational confession that defines Christian identity
- This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority
- All mDNA elements radiate from and return to Jesus as Lord
- Christology determines missiology, which determines ecclesiology

**Theological Implication:** Movements that lose Jesus' centrality lose their foundation and power.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4; *ReJesus*, entire book; *Disciplism*, Chapter 6

### 7. Salvation/Sanctification and Metanoia

**Theological Foundation:** Salvation involves transformation—not just justification but sanctification, becoming like Christ.

**Connection:**
- Metanoia (repentance) is essential for salvation and ongoing sanctification
- Metanoia means transformation of mind, soul, and will
- The Metanoia Journey reflects the Christian journey of ongoing conversion
- Metanoia brings us in sync with the mind of Christ

**Theological Implication:** Churches that avoid metanoia (transformation) may be avoiding the full implications of the gospel.

**Source Connection:** *Metanoia*, entire book; *Reframation*, Chapter 5

---

### 8. Pneumatology (Holy Spirit) and Organic Systems

**Theological Foundation:** The Holy Spirit is the life-giving breath of God, who animates and empowers the church.

**Connection:**
- Organic systems trust the Holy Spirit to organize rather than relying solely on human systems
- The Spirit distributes gifts (including APEST) throughout the body
- Movemental organization reflects the Spirit's work, not just human planning
- Organic systems allow the Spirit to work organically

**Theological Implication:** Over-reliance on human organization may limit the Spirit's work.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 9; *The Starfish and the Spirit*, entire book

---

### 9. Eschatology and Movement

**Theological Foundation:** The end (eschaton) is God's ultimate purpose—the restoration of all things, the new creation.

**Connection:**
- Movements point toward God's ultimate purposes
- Movement dynamics reflect the expansive, transformative nature of God's Kingdom coming
- The multiplication and reproduction of movements reflect God's purposes for the world
- Movements participate in God's mission to make all things new

**Theological Implication:** Movements that focus only on growth may miss God's ultimate purposes.

**Source Connection:** *The Forgotten Ways*, throughout; *On the Verge*, Chapter 9

---

### 10. Creation/Cultural Mandate and APEST as Universal Archetypes

**Theological Foundation:** Humans are created in God's image and given a cultural mandate—to steward and develop creation.

**Connection:**
- APEST functions appear as universal archetypes throughout human culture
- This reflects the imago Dei—the image of God in humanity
- The fivefold functions are not limited to the church but present in all human endeavor
- Creation gifting applies universally, not just to Christians

**Theological Implication:** The church should recognize and honor APEST expressions in culture, seeing them as "traces of God."

**Source Connection:** *5Q*, Chapter 2: "The Traces of God"; *Reframation*, throughout

## Integration Principles

### 1. Theological Grounding

All concepts are theologically grounded. Understanding theological connections ensures concepts function theologically, not just pragmatically.

### 2. Doctrinal Coherence

Concepts serve doctrinal purposes. They're not separate from theology but expressions of theological understanding.

### 3. Trinitarian Shape

Much of the work reflects trinitarian theology—diversity in unity, relational being, mutual indwelling.

### 4. Christocentric Focus

Everything centers on Jesus Christ. Theological connections always return to Christology.

### 5. Missional Purpose

Theological connections reveal how concepts serve God's mission—the missio Dei.

## Practical Implications

### For Teaching

When teaching concepts:
- **Connect to Theology:** Always show theological foundations
- **Reveal Doctrine:** Help people see doctrinal depth
- **Maintain Theology:** Ensure concepts function theologically

### For Application

When applying concepts:
- **Theological Use:** Use concepts as theological frameworks, not just strategies
- **Doctrinal Alignment:** Ensure application aligns with doctrine
- **Mission Purpose:** Remember concepts serve God's mission

### For Discernment

When evaluating concepts:
- **Theological Test:** Do concepts align with core doctrines?
- **Christocentric Check:** Do concepts center on Jesus?
- **Mission Alignment:** Do concepts serve God's mission?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Theologically Grounded Movement

A movement deeply connected to theology:
- **Trinitarian Understanding:** Sees APEST as reflecting God's nature
- **Christocentric:** Centers everything on "Jesus is Lord"
- **Missional:** Participates in missio Dei through missional-incarnational impulse
- **Ecclesiological:** Understands church as movemental by design
- **Result:** Theologically rich, doctrinally grounded movement

### Example 2: Pragmatic Application (Common Problem)

A church using concepts pragmatically:
- **No Theological Grounding:** Sees concepts as strategies, not theology
- **Pragmatic Focus:** Uses what "works" without theological depth
- **Doctrinal Disconnect:** Doesn't connect to core doctrines
- **Result:** Superficial application, concepts lack power
