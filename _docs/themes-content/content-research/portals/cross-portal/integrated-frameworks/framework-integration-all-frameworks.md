# Framework Integration: All Frameworks as Integrated System

## Integration Overview

All of Alan Hirsch's frameworks work together as an integrated system. They are not separate tools to be used independently, but interconnected parts of a comprehensive approach to missional movement. This integration guide shows how all frameworks work together to create what is called "Apostolic Genius"—the emergent organization that enables transformative movements.

The integration is not additive but multiplicative. Each framework enhances the others, and together they create something far greater than any could alone. Understanding how they work together is essential for effective implementation.

## The Core Integration: mDNA as the Foundation

**mDNA as the Systemic Foundation**: The mDNA System provides the foundational framework that integrates all others. It contains six essential elements, one of which is APEST, and it provides the systemic context for all other frameworks.

**All Frameworks Serve mDNA**: Every other framework serves to activate, enable, or multiply the mDNA system:
- **APEST/5Q**: Provides the ministry environment (one element of mDNA)
- **Metanoia Journey**: Creates the transformation process that enables mDNA activation
- **Paradigm-Platform-Practices**: Provides the architecture for mDNA implementation
- **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: One element of mDNA, enabled by other frameworks
- **Movement Dynamics**: Shows how mDNA scales and multiplies
- **Reframation Process**: Enables seeing and engaging culture for mDNA activation
- **Disciplism**: Provides the disciple-making process (one element of mDNA)
- **Organic Systems**: Provides the structures that enable mDNA (one element of mDNA)

## Framework Relationships

### Primary Relationships

**mDNA ↔ APEST/5Q**:
- APEST is one element of mDNA
- APEST provides the ministry environment that enables mDNA
- mDNA provides the systemic context that gives APEST purpose

**Metanoia Journey ↔ Movement Dynamics**:
- Metanoia Journey creates the transformation that enables Movement Dynamics
- Movement Dynamics provides the principles for how transformed organizations multiply
- Cyclical relationship: as movements multiply, new metanoia journeys are needed

**Paradigm-Platform-Practices ↔ Metanoia Journey**:
- Paradigm-Platform-Practices is the architecture of the Metanoia Journey
- The three layers (mind, soul, will) correspond to the U-curve stages
- Integration ensures transformation happens at all three levels

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Reframation Process**:
- Reframation Process enables seeing and engaging culture
- Missional-Incarnational Impulse provides the twin movements framework
- Together they enable authentic cultural engagement

**Disciplism ↔ mDNA**:
- Disciplism provides the disciple-making process
- Disciple-making is one element of mDNA
- Disciplism reframes evangelism within discipleship context

**Organic Systems ↔ Movement Dynamics**:
- Organic Systems provides the structures that enable movement
- Movement Dynamics shows how organic systems scale and multiply
- Together they enable movemental organization

### Secondary Relationships

**All Frameworks ↔ mDNA**:
- Every framework serves to activate, enable, or multiply mDNA
- mDNA provides the systemic context for all frameworks
- Integration creates Apostolic Genius

**Metanoia Journey ↔ All Frameworks**:
- Metanoia Journey creates the transformation capacity for all frameworks
- All frameworks require movemental thinking to function
- The journey enables integration

**Movement Dynamics ↔ All Frameworks**:
- Movement Dynamics shows how all frameworks scale and multiply
- Every framework must be reproducible to enable movement
- Fractal replication applies to all

## System Dynamics

### The Integration Creates Apostolic Genius

**Emergent Organization**: When all frameworks are properly integrated, they create "Apostolic Genius"—an emergent organization that is greater than the sum of its parts.

**Dynamic Interrelationship**: All frameworks work together dynamically, each enhancing the others and creating synergistic effects.

**Systemic Thinking**: The integration requires systemic thinking—understanding how all parts work together as a whole.

**Movemental Capacity**: The integration creates movemental capacity—the ability to think and act like a movement.

### What Happens When Integration Is Missing

**Frameworks in Isolation**:
- Each framework exists separately
- No synergistic effects
- Missing the emergent organization
- Cannot achieve Apostolic Genius

**Missing Frameworks**:
- Some frameworks present, others missing
- Gaps in the system
- Incomplete activation
- Limited movemental capacity

**Lack of Understanding**:
- Frameworks exist but relationships aren't understood
- No intentional integration
- Missing the systemic context
- Cannot achieve full potential

## Activation Principles

The integration activates when:

1. **All frameworks are present**: Each framework is understood and operational.

2. **Relationships are understood**: How frameworks work together is clear.

3. **mDNA is the foundation**: All frameworks serve to activate, enable, or multiply mDNA.

4. **Integration is intentional**: The relationships are intentionally cultivated.

5. **Systemic thinking is present**: Understanding how all parts work together as a whole.

6. **Movemental capacity is created**: The integration creates the ability to think and act like a movement.

What blocks integration:
- **Missing frameworks**: Not all frameworks are present
- **Lack of understanding**: Relationships aren't clear
- **Isolation**: Frameworks operate separately
- **Lack of intentionality**: Not cultivating relationships
- **Institutional thinking**: Operating through institutional rather than movemental paradigms
- **Missing mDNA foundation**: Not understanding mDNA as the foundation

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess if all frameworks are properly integrated:

1. **Evaluate framework presence**: Are all frameworks understood and operational?

2. **Assess relationships**: Are the relationships between frameworks clear?

3. **Check mDNA foundation**: Is mDNA serving as the foundation for all frameworks?

4. **Examine integration**: Is the integration intentional and cultivated?

5. **Look for systemic thinking**: Is there understanding of how all parts work together?

6. **Assess movemental capacity**: Is movemental capacity being created?

Key questions:
- Are all frameworks present and operational?
- Are the relationships between frameworks clear?
- Is mDNA serving as the foundation?
- Is the integration intentional and cultivated?
- Is there understanding of how all parts work together?
- Is movemental capacity being created?

## Implementation Pathways

To integrate all frameworks in your church or organization:

1. **Understand mDNA as foundation**: Recognize mDNA as the systemic foundation for all frameworks.

2. **Learn all frameworks**: Understand each framework individually before integrating.

3. **Understand relationships**: Learn how frameworks work together.

4. **Cultivate integration**: Intentionally develop the relationships between frameworks.

5. **Develop systemic thinking**: Learn to think systemically about how all parts work together.

6. **Create movemental capacity**: Use the integration to create the ability to think and act like a movement.

7. **Watch for emergence**: Look for Apostolic Genius—the emergent organization.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Understand mDNA as the foundation
- Learning: Learn all frameworks individually
- Relationships: Understand how frameworks work together
- Integration: Cultivate relationships intentionally
- Thinking: Develop systemic thinking
- Capacity: Create movemental capacity
- Emergence: Watch for Apostolic Genius

## Case Studies and Examples

**The Early Church**: Exhibited all frameworks working together as an integrated system, creating Apostolic Genius that enabled exponential growth.

**The Chinese Underground Church**: Maintained all frameworks in integration, enabling the movement to scale from 2 million to 120 million while maintaining identity.

**Contemporary Movements**: Many missional movements today are discovering that all frameworks are necessary and must work together as an integrated system.

**Large Church Transitions**: Churches transitioning from institutional to movemental must integrate all frameworks to achieve full transformation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Using frameworks in isolation**: Trying to implement frameworks separately without integration.

2. **Missing frameworks**: Not having all frameworks present and operational.

3. **Lack of understanding**: Not understanding how frameworks work together.

4. **Missing mDNA foundation**: Not recognizing mDNA as the foundation for all frameworks.

5. **Lack of intentionality**: Not cultivating the relationships between frameworks.

6. **Institutional thinking**: Operating through institutional rather than movemental paradigms.
