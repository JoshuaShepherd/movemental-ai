# Integration: Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores how the core frameworks work together—mDNA, APEST/5Q, Metanoia Journey, and other frameworks. Integration is essential because frameworks don't work in isolation; they inform and enhance each other when used together.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers how frameworks integrate, system integration, comprehensive application, and advanced synthesis.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from understanding integration, to how frameworks work together, to comprehensive application, to advanced synthesis.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to understand how frameworks integrate, apply frameworks together, and achieve comprehensive transformation.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: How do mDNA, APEST/5Q, and the Metanoia Journey work together?

**Answer:**

The core frameworks—mDNA, APEST/5Q, and the Metanoia Journey—work together as an integrated system. They inform and enhance each other, and using them together creates more comprehensive transformation than using them in isolation.

**How They Integrate:**

1. **mDNA as Foundation:** mDNA provides the framework for understanding what needs to be present for movement to emerge. It identifies the six essential elements that must work together. This is the foundational framework that describes the system.

2. **APEST/5Q Enabling Capacity:** APEST/5Q activates the capacity needed to express mDNA elements. The five functions enable the church to operate with full intelligence, making it possible to express mDNA elements effectively. APEST culture is itself one of the six mDNA elements.

3. **Metanoia Journey as Process:** The Metanoia Journey provides the process for transformation—moving from current state to desired state. It's the "how" that enables mDNA activation and APEST implementation. It provides the path for change.

**Integration Points:**

- **APEST enables mDNA:** The five functions provide the capacity to express mDNA elements. For example, Apostolic function enables extension and multiplication; Prophetic function enables discernment and challenge; etc.

- **Metanoia enables activation:** The Metanoia Journey process enables churches to move from suppressed or missing mDNA elements to activated ones. It provides the transformation process.

- **mDNA guides APEST:** Understanding mDNA helps churches see why all five APEST functions are needed (to express all mDNA elements). It provides the framework for understanding APEST necessity.

- **Together they create system:** When used together, these frameworks create a comprehensive system for transformation—mDNA describes what, APEST enables capacity, Metanoia provides process.

**Practical Integration:**

When implementing:
1. Use mDNA to assess current state (what elements present/missing)
2. Use APEST/5Q to activate capacity (what functions needed)
3. Use Metanoia Journey as process (how to change)
4. Work systemically (all frameworks together, not separately)

**Key Points:**
- Frameworks inform and enhance each other
- mDNA describes what, APEST enables capacity, Metanoia provides process
- Using together creates comprehensive transformation
- Work systemically, not separately

**Examples:**
- Churches using all frameworks together
- Comprehensive transformation processes
- Integrated implementation approaches

**Connections:**
- All core frameworks working together
- System thinking and integration
- Comprehensive transformation

**Practical Application:**
Understanding integration helps churches use frameworks together rather than separately, creating more comprehensive and effective transformation.

**Further Exploration:**
- How do you use frameworks together?
- What does comprehensive application look like?
- How do frameworks enhance each other?
