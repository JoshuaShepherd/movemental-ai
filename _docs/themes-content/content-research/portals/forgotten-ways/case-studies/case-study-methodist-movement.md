# The Methodist Movement: Mobilizing Ordinary People for Exponential Growth

## Context and Background

**Who, What, When, Where:**
The Methodist movement emerged in the mid-18th century under the leadership of John Wesley (1703-1791) and his brother Charles. Beginning in England, the movement spread to America and grew from a little over 2 percent of the churchgoing population in 1776 to 34 percent by 1850. In America, by 1850 the Methodists had four thousand circuit riders (church planters), almost eight thousand local preachers, and over one million members.

**Initial Situation and Conditions:**
The movement began in a context where the established church (Anglican) was largely disconnected from ordinary people. Wesley, an Anglican priest, began organizing small groups (classes and bands) for spiritual formation and accountability. These groups became the foundation for a movement that would transform both England and America.

**Key People Involved:**
- **John Wesley**: The movement's primary leader, demonstrating Apostle/Prophet functions
- **Charles Wesley**: John's brother, known for his hymn writing
- **Circuit Riders**: Lay preachers who rode from town to town, planting churches
- **Class Leaders and Local Preachers**: Ordinary people mobilized for leadership and mission

**What Makes This Example Relevant:**
The Methodist movement demonstrates the power of mobilizing ordinary people for mission. It shows how activating the "laity" and removing artificial barriers to leadership enables exponential growth. The movement also demonstrates both the power of apostolic organization and the danger of institutionalization.

## The Story

The story begins with John Wesley, an Anglican priest who, along with his brother Charles, began organizing small groups for spiritual formation. These groups, called "classes" and "bands," provided accountability, discipleship, and community. But what emerged was far more than a small group movement.

Wesley's approach was distinctly apostolic. He organized the movement around:
- **Classes and Bands**: Small groups for spiritual formation and accountability
- **Circuit Riders**: Lay preachers who rode from town to town, planting churches
- **Local Preachers**: Ordinary people authorized to preach and lead
- **Class Leaders**: Lay people who led small groups and provided pastoral care

The movement grew exponentially because it mobilized ordinary people. As historian Steve Addison notes, "This achievement would have been impossible without the mobilization of ordinary people—white and black, young and old, men and women—and the removal of artificial barriers to their engagement in significant leadership as class leaders, local workers, and itinerant preachers."

In America, the movement grew from a little over 2 percent of the churchgoing population in 1776 to 34 percent by 1850. By that time, the Methodists had:
- Four thousand circuit riders (church planters)
- Almost eight thousand local preachers
- Over one million members

The circuit riders were particularly significant. These were laypeople who, with some rudimentary training, rode from town to town, planting churches as they went. They would then circle back to ensure the churches were growing and healthy. This apostolic organization enabled rapid multiplication.

However, the movement also demonstrates the danger of institutionalization. Around 1850, the stunning growth turned into decline. Sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke discovered that during this period, the more institutionally inclined Episcopalians and Presbyterians had relentlessly mocked the Methodists as being uncouth and not knowing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

Under this barrage of insults, the Methodist leadership decided that circuit riders should do rigorous seminary training—four years of seminary as a prerequisite for licensing. Methodism in America has never regained a positive growth pattern since that fateful decision.

## Concepts and Frameworks Demonstrated

**All Six Elements of mDNA in Evidence:**

1. **Jesus is Lord**: The central confession remained, with emphasis on personal conversion and holiness.

2. **Disciple-Making**: The movement focused on making disciples through classes and bands. These small groups provided accountability, formation, and reproduction.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The movement had a strong outward thrust through circuit riders who went from town to town. This missional impulse was fueled by mobilizing ordinary people.

4. **APEST Culture**: All five functions operated. Wesley demonstrated Apostle/Prophet functions. The movement had strong apostolic (circuit riders), evangelistic (proclamation), shepherding (class leaders), and teaching elements.

5. **Organic Systems**: The movement organized through classes, bands, and circuits—organic structures that could reproduce. Each class contained the full DNA and could reproduce itself.

6. **Communitas**: Deep community formed through classes and bands. This was authentic togetherness forged through shared accountability and mission.

**Movement Dynamics:**
- Mobilization of ordinary people
- Organic organization through classes and circuits
- Missional impulse through circuit riders
- Reproduction at every level
- Network organization that enabled rapid multiplication

**The Professionalization Trap:**
The movement also demonstrates the danger of professionalization. When the circuit riders were required to do four years of seminary training, the movement lost its multiplication capacity. This professionalization created dependency and eliminated the mobilization of ordinary people that had fueled growth.

## Analysis

**What Worked and Why:**

1. **Mobilization of Ordinary People**: The movement's success came from activating all believers, not just professionals. Class leaders, local preachers, and circuit riders were all ordinary people.

2. **Removal of Artificial Barriers**: The movement removed barriers to leadership based on education, class, or gender. This enabled multiplication of leadership capacity.

3. **Organic Organization**: Classes, bands, and circuits provided structure without hierarchy. Each class was self-contained yet connected to the larger movement.

4. **Apostolic Organization**: Circuit riders enabled rapid multiplication. They planted churches and then moved on, creating a network of reproducing communities.

5. **Focus on Discipleship**: Classes and bands provided accountability and formation. This focus on discipleship enabled reproduction.

**Key Factors for Success:**
- Mobilization of ordinary people
- Removal of artificial barriers to leadership
- Organic organization through classes and circuits
- Apostolic organization through circuit riders
- Focus on discipleship and accountability
- Network organization that enabled multiplication

**Challenges Faced and How Addressed:**
- **Institutional Opposition**: Initially addressed by operating outside established structures
- **Lack of Professional Clergy**: Addressed by mobilizing ordinary people for leadership
- **Geographic Distance**: Addressed through circuit riders who traveled from town to town
- **Maintaining Quality**: Addressed through classes and bands that provided accountability

**What Made This Example Significant:**
The Methodist movement demonstrates the power of mobilizing ordinary people for mission. It shows how removing artificial barriers to leadership enables exponential growth. But it also demonstrates the danger of institutionalization—how professionalization can kill the very dynamics that created growth.

**The Professionalization Trap:**
The movement's decline after 1850 demonstrates a crucial lesson: professionalization can kill movement. When circuit riders were required to do four years of seminary training, the movement lost:
- Its multiplication capacity (fewer people could become circuit riders)
- Its mobilization of ordinary people (barriers were re-erected)
- Its organic organization (dependency on institutions was created)
- Its growth pattern (Methodism has never regained positive growth)

## Lessons Learned

**What We Can Learn:**

1. **Mobilize Ordinary People**: The movement's success came from activating all believers, not just professionals. We need to mobilize everyone, not just a professional class.

2. **Remove Artificial Barriers**: The movement removed barriers to leadership based on education, class, or gender. We need to remove similar barriers.

3. **Organic Organization Enables Multiplication**: Classes, bands, and circuits provided structure that enabled reproduction. We need organic systems, not hierarchies.

4. **Apostolic Organization Enables Rapid Multiplication**: Circuit riders enabled rapid multiplication. We need apostolic structures that plant and move.

5. **Professionalization Can Kill Movement**: The movement's decline demonstrates that professionalization can eliminate the very dynamics that created growth. We must resist this trap.

**Transferable Principles:**

- Mobilize all believers, not just professionals
- Remove artificial barriers to leadership
- Organize organically to enable reproduction
- Create apostolic structures that plant and move
- Focus on discipleship and accountability
- Resist professionalization that creates dependency

**What to Emulate:**

- Separating discipleship from mission
- Institutionalization that kills movement dynamics

## Contemporary Relevance

**How This Informs Current Practice:**

The Methodist movement challenges us to mobilize ordinary people for mission rather than relying on professionals. It shows how removing artificial barriers to leadership enables exponential growth. But it also warns us about the danger of professionalization—how requiring specialized training can kill the very dynamics that create movement.

**What It Means for Churches Today:**

1. **Mobilize Ordinary People**: We need to activate all believers for mission, not just professionals. Every Christian is called and equipped for ministry.

2. **Remove Artificial Barriers**: We need to remove barriers to leadership based on education, class, gender, or other factors. Leadership should be based on calling and character, not credentials.

3. **Organic Organization**: We need organic systems that enable reproduction. Small groups can be both places of formation and bases for mission.

4. **Apostolic Organization**: We need structures that enable rapid multiplication. Church planters and missional leaders need to plant and move, not just maintain.

5. **Resist Professionalization**: We must resist the temptation to require specialized training that creates dependency and eliminates multiplication capacity.

**How Principles Apply Now:**

- **In Small Groups**: The class system shows how small groups can be both places of formation and bases for mission. We need groups that do both.

- **In Leadership Development**: The movement shows how to develop leaders through apprenticeship rather than requiring formal education. We need pathways that don't create artificial barriers.

- **In Church Planting**: Circuit riders provide a model for how to plant churches rapidly. We need planters who can plant and move, creating networks of reproducing communities.

- **In Professional Ministry**: The movement's decline warns us about professionalization. We must resist requiring credentials that eliminate multiplication capacity.

**The Professionalization Warning:**

The Methodist movement's decline after 1850 serves as a warning: professionalization can kill movement. When we require specialized training that creates dependency and eliminates the mobilization of ordinary people, we kill the very dynamics that enable growth. We must find ways to develop leaders without creating artificial barriers.
