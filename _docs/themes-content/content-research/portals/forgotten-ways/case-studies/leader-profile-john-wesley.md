# John Wesley: Apostle/Prophet and Mobilizer of Ordinary People

## Context and Background

**Who, What, When, Where:**
John Wesley (1703-1791) was an Anglican priest who became the primary catalyst for the Methodist movement. Beginning in England in the mid-18th century, the movement he catalyzed grew from a little over 2 percent of the churchgoing population in 1776 to 34 percent by 1850 in America. The movement mobilized ordinary people for mission and demonstrated both the power of apostolic organization and the danger of institutionalization.

**Initial Situation:**
Wesley was born into an Anglican family and became an Anglican priest. However, he found the established church largely disconnected from ordinary people. He began organizing small groups (classes and bands) for spiritual formation and accountability, which became the foundation for a movement that would transform both England and America.

**Key Moments:**
- Organization of classes and bands for spiritual formation
- Development of circuit riders and local preachers
- Mobilization of ordinary people for leadership and mission
- Exponential growth of the movement
- The movement's decline after professionalization (post-1850)

**What Makes This Example Relevant:**
Wesley demonstrates the Apostle/Prophet combination in APEST—pioneering new forms while calling the church back to its essence. He shows how mobilizing ordinary people enables exponential growth. His story also demonstrates both the power of apostolic organization and the danger of institutionalization.

## The Story

Wesley's story begins with his recognition that the established church was disconnected from ordinary people. As an Anglican priest, he began organizing small groups (classes and bands) for spiritual formation and accountability. But what emerged was far more than a small group movement.

Wesley's approach was distinctly apostolic. He organized the movement around:
- **Classes and Bands**: Small groups for spiritual formation and accountability
- **Circuit Riders**: Lay preachers who rode from town to town, planting churches
- **Local Preachers**: Ordinary people authorized to preach and lead
- **Class Leaders**: Lay people who led small groups and provided pastoral care

The movement grew exponentially because it mobilized ordinary people. As historian Steve Addison notes, "This achievement would have been impossible without the mobilization of ordinary people—white and black, young and old, men and women—and the removal of artificial barriers to their engagement in significant leadership."

In America, the movement grew from a little over 2 percent of the churchgoing population in 1776 to 34 percent by 1850. By that time, the Methodists had:
- Four thousand circuit riders (church planters)
- Almost eight thousand local preachers
- Over one million members

However, the movement also demonstrates the danger of institutionalization. Around 1850, the stunning growth turned into decline. Sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke discovered that when the Methodist leadership required circuit riders to do four years of seminary training, the movement lost its multiplication capacity. Methodism in America has never regained a positive growth pattern since that fateful decision.

## APEST Functions Demonstrated

**Apostle (AQ) - Pioneering Intelligence:**
Wesley demonstrated classic apostolic function:
- **Extending**: He extended the gospel to ordinary people who were disconnected from the established church
- **Multiplying**: He catalyzed a movement that grew exponentially through mobilizing ordinary people
- **Architecting**: He designed an organizational structure (classes, bands, circuits) that enabled reproduction
- **Mobilizing**: He mobilized ordinary people for leadership and mission, removing artificial barriers

**Prophet (PQ) - Discerning Intelligence:**
Wesley also demonstrated strong prophetic function:
- **Challenging**: He challenged the established church's disconnect from ordinary people
- **Calling to Covenant Faithfulness**: He called people back to personal holiness and accountability
- **Exposing Falsehood**: He exposed the gap between the church's message and its practice
- **Envisioning Alternative**: He envisioned and created an alternative way of being church

**The Apostle/Prophet Combination:**
Wesley's unique contribution was combining apostolic pioneering with prophetic challenge. He didn't just create new forms; he called the church back to its essence. This combination enabled both innovation and faithfulness—the movement was new while being deeply rooted in biblical principles.

## Concepts and Frameworks Demonstrated

**Mobilization of Ordinary People:**
Wesley's movement succeeded because it activated all believers, not just professionals. Class leaders, local preachers, and circuit riders were all ordinary people. This mobilization enabled exponential growth.

**Removal of Artificial Barriers:**
The movement removed barriers to leadership based on education, class, or gender. This enabled multiplication of leadership capacity. Anyone called and equipped could lead.

**Organic Organization:**
Classes, bands, and circuits provided structure without hierarchy. Each class was self-contained yet connected to the larger movement. This organic organization enabled reproduction.

**Apostolic Organization:**
Circuit riders enabled rapid multiplication. They planted churches and then moved on, creating a network of reproducing communities. This apostolic organization was key to the movement's growth.

**The Professionalization Trap:**
The movement's decline after 1850 demonstrates a crucial lesson: professionalization can kill movement. When circuit riders were required to do four years of seminary training, the movement lost its multiplication capacity and mobilization of ordinary people.

## Analysis

**What Made Wesley Effective:**

1. **Mobilization of Ordinary People**: The movement's success came from activating all believers, not just professionals. This multiplication of leadership capacity enabled exponential growth.

2. **Removal of Artificial Barriers**: The movement removed barriers to leadership based on education, class, or gender. This enabled anyone called and equipped to lead.

3. **Apostolic Organization**: Circuit riders enabled rapid multiplication. They planted churches and moved on, creating networks of reproducing communities.

4. **Prophetic Challenge**: Wesley challenged the established church's disconnect from ordinary people while calling people to personal holiness and accountability.

5. **Organic Structure**: Classes, bands, and circuits provided structure that enabled reproduction without creating hierarchy.

**Key Factors for Success:**
- Mobilization of ordinary people
- Removal of artificial barriers to leadership
- Apostolic organization through circuit riders
- Prophetic challenge to established forms
- Organic structure through classes and circuits
- Focus on discipleship and accountability

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Institutional Opposition**: The established church opposed the movement
- **Maintaining Quality While Multiplying**: Addressed through classes and bands that provided accountability
- **Geographic Distance**: Addressed through circuit riders who traveled from town to town
- **The Professionalization Trap**: The movement eventually fell into this trap, leading to decline

**What Made This Example Significant:**
Wesley demonstrates the power of mobilizing ordinary people for mission. He shows how removing artificial barriers to leadership enables exponential growth. But he also demonstrates the danger of institutionalization—how professionalization can kill the very dynamics that create movement.

## Lessons Learned

**What We Can Learn:**

1. **Mobilize Ordinary People**: The movement's success came from activating all believers, not just professionals. We need to mobilize everyone, not just a professional class.

2. **Remove Artificial Barriers**: The movement removed barriers to leadership based on education, class, or gender. We need to remove similar barriers.

3. **Apostolic Organization Enables Multiplication**: Circuit riders enabled rapid multiplication. We need apostolic structures that plant and move.

4. **Prophetic Challenge Is Necessary**: Wesley challenged established forms while calling people to faithfulness. We need both innovation and faithfulness.

5. **Professionalization Can Kill Movement**: The movement's decline demonstrates that professionalization can eliminate the very dynamics that create growth. We must resist this trap.

**Transferable Principles:**

- Mobilize all believers, not just professionals
- Remove artificial barriers to leadership
- Create apostolic structures that plant and move
- Combine innovation with faithfulness
- Organize organically to enable reproduction
- Resist professionalization that creates dependency

**What to Emulate:**
- Mobilization of ordinary people
- Removal of artificial barriers to leadership
- Apostolic organization through circuit riders
- Prophetic challenge to established forms
- Organic structure through small groups
- Focus on discipleship and accountability

**What to Avoid:**
- Professionalization that excludes ordinary people
- Artificial barriers to leadership
- Hierarchical structures that prevent multiplication
- Innovation without faithfulness
- Dependency on institutions
- Institutionalization that kills movement dynamics

## Contemporary Relevance

**How This Informs Current Practice:**

Wesley's example challenges us to mobilize ordinary people for mission rather than relying on professionals. It shows how removing artificial barriers to leadership enables exponential growth. But it also warns us about the danger of professionalization—how requiring specialized training can kill the very dynamics that create movement.

**What It Means for Leaders Today:**

1. **Mobilize Ordinary People**: We need to activate all believers for mission, not just professionals. Every Christian is called and equipped for ministry.

2. **Remove Artificial Barriers**: We need to remove barriers to leadership based on education, class, gender, or other factors. Leadership should be based on calling and character, not credentials.

3. **Create Apostolic Structures**: We need structures that enable rapid multiplication. Church planters and missional leaders need to plant and move, not just maintain.

4. **Combine Innovation with Faithfulness**: We need both prophetic challenge to established forms and faithfulness to biblical principles. Innovation without faithfulness is empty; faithfulness without innovation is stagnant.

5. **Resist Professionalization**: We must resist the temptation to require specialized training that creates dependency and eliminates multiplication capacity.

**How Principles Apply Now:**

- **In Leadership Development**: The movement shows how to develop leaders through apprenticeship rather than requiring formal education. We need pathways that don't create artificial barriers.

- **In Small Groups**: The class system shows how small groups can be both places of formation and bases for mission. We need groups that do both.

- **In Church Planting**: Circuit riders provide a model for how to plant churches rapidly. We need planters who can plant and move, creating networks of reproducing communities.

- **In Professional Ministry**: The movement's decline warns us about professionalization. We must resist requiring credentials that eliminate multiplication capacity.

**The Wesleyan Warning:**

Wesley's movement serves as both an example and a warning. It shows the power of mobilizing ordinary people, but it also demonstrates how professionalization can kill movement. When we require specialized training that creates dependency and eliminates the mobilization of ordinary people, we kill the very dynamics that enable growth. We must find ways to develop leaders without creating artificial barriers.
