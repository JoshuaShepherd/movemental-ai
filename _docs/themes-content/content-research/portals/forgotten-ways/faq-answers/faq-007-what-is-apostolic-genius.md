# What is Apostolic Genius?

## Direct Answer

Apostolic Genius is that mysterious, dynamic, movemental energy—those vibrant spiritual instincts—that exist within the people of God and can be activated to create transformative movements. It is the emergent system that arises when all six elements of movement DNA (mDNA) are present and functioning together, creating something greater than the sum of its parts. Like a smartphone operating system that represents a paradigmatic upgrade, Apostolic Genius represents a fundamentally different way of organizing and operating compared to institutional forms of church.

The term "Apostolic Genius" was coined precisely because no existing word or phrase adequately captured this phenomenon. It describes the system that emerges from the dynamic interrelationship of all the key elements working together. Apostolic Genius is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges. It is what happens when all six elements of mDNA (Jesus is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas) are present and functioning together. The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic: each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate.

## Expanded Explanation

How do we account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in just two centuries? How did the underground church in China grow from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under the most severe persecution? What generative system undergirds these transformative movements, and more importantly, does it still lie dormant within the church today?

These questions launched my own quest to discover what I came to call Apostolic Genius. The term itself was coined precisely because no existing word or phrase adequately captured this phenomenon. I wanted to pinpoint something that is very hard to define—that movemental energy, those vibrant spiritual instincts, that mysterious dynamic that formed their world.

Apostolic Genius is an emergent property—it doesn't exist until the system emerges. It is what happens when all six elements of mDNA are present and functioning together. Like biological DNA, movement DNA (mDNA) is found in every living cell—in this case, every genuine expression of church. It contains all the genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism, is self-replicating, carries vital information for healthy reproduction, and can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated.

Think of Apostolic Genius as your smartphone operating system—it's not just an upgrade from version 2.0 to 3.0; it is a paradigmatic upgrade from the previous level of organization. It represents a fundamentally different way to organize and operate. When all six elements of mDNA come together and begin to create and inform a Christian organization, apostolic movement appears to be inevitable.

The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate. This is why churches can be doing many good things—good discipleship, good mission, good community—and still not experience the transformative power of movement.

Apostolic Genius is not something new to be created but something latent to be recovered. It is encoded in the very being of the church, a gift from God that has been forgotten but not lost. The future lies in the womb of the present; the potential for movement already exists within every expression of church, waiting to be awakened.

When we observe remarkable movements like the early church, the Chinese underground church, the Celtic missionary movement, the Moravians, or the Methodists, we see Apostolic Genius in action. These movements all demonstrate the same six elements working together: Jesus is Lord at the center, disciple-making as the core practice, missional-incarnational impulse extending outward and embedding deep, APEST culture activating fivefold ministry, organic systems enabling reproduction, and communitas forming in liminal spaces.

The power of Apostolic Genius becomes evident when we see how movements that lack our ample resources—no buildings, no professional leadership, no formal institutions, no mass meetings—still manage to grow exponentially and transform cultures. They had none of the things we would ordinarily employ to solve the problems of the church, yet they flourished. This tells us something profound: the church has everything it needs to get the job done. God has designed his ecclesia to be inherently movemental.

## Key Points

- **Emergent system**: Apostolic Genius emerges when all six mDNA elements work together, creating something greater than the sum of parts.

- **Systemic nature**: Each element is necessary but not sufficient. All six must be present and functioning for the system to activate.

- **Latent potential**: Apostolic Genius is not something new to be created but something latent to be recovered. It's encoded in the church's being.

- **Paradigmatic upgrade**: Like a smartphone OS, Apostolic Genius represents a fundamentally different way of organizing and operating.

- **Evidence from history**: Every remarkable movement demonstrates Apostolic Genius—the same six elements working together.

- **Not about resources**: Movements often have fewer resources, not more. The power comes from the system, not external resources.

- **Universal pattern**: The consistency across different cultures, times, and circumstances suggests Apostolic Genius is inherent to the church's design.

- **Recovery, not creation**: The task is to recover what's been forgotten, not create something new.

## Practical Application

To activate Apostolic Genius in your church, begin by recognizing that the potential already exists within your church. You don't need to import an alien system; you need to recover what's been forgotten. This requires prayer, the work of the Holy Spirit, passionate love of God, and intentional embedding of mDNA elements.

Assess which elements of mDNA are present, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Use the mDNA framework as a diagnostic tool. Be honest about what's working and what's not. Remember that all six elements are necessary—you can't pick and choose.

Create conditions where Apostolic Genius can emerge. This involves:
- Centering everything on Jesus is Lord
- Prioritizing disciple-making as the core practice
- Developing missional-incarnational practices
- Activating APEST culture throughout the church
- Building organic systems that enable reproduction
- Creating liminal experiences that form communitas

Think systemically rather than programmatically. Instead of asking "What program should we add?" ask "What elements of mDNA are missing or suppressed?" Focus on the system, not just individual elements.

Be patient. Apostolic Genius doesn't emerge overnight. It requires consistent effort over time, like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation. Movement builds through consistent application of the six elements.

Distill to essence. Movements thrive when the message is simple enough to be transferred easily, yet profound enough to transform cultures. Don't overcomplicate. Focus on the core elements and let them work together.

Trust the Holy Spirit. Apostolic Genius can't be engineered through human effort alone. Trust that the Holy Spirit will do the work of activation. Your job is to create conditions where it can emerge.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates Apostolic Genius in action. They had all six elements working together: Jesus is Lord at the center, disciple-making as the core practice, missional-incarnational impulse extending outward, APEST culture activating fivefold ministry, organic systems enabling reproduction, and communitas forming in liminal spaces. Despite having no buildings, no professional leadership, and no formal institutions, they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries.

The Chinese underground church shows Apostolic Genius working under severe persecution. With no buildings, no central organization, and no mass meetings, they demonstrated all six elements and grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years. The system was present and active, enabling movement even in the most difficult circumstances.

The Celtic missionary movement demonstrates Apostolic Genius. Celtic missionaries didn't build cathedrals and expect people to come. Instead, they went to people, lived among them, and the movement spread through relationships and networks. All six elements were present and working together.

The Methodist movement under Wesley shows Apostolic Genius. During Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women became Methodists. The movement had all six elements: Jesus is Lord, rigorous disciple-making, missional-incarnational engagement, APEST culture, organic systems (class meetings, societies, circuits), and communitas.

Contemporary churches that have activated Apostolic Genius show similar patterns. They center on Jesus is Lord, prioritize disciple-making, engage missionally and incarnationally, activate APEST culture throughout, build organic systems, and create communitas through shared adventure. These churches experience multiplication and movement rather than just addition and growth.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Apostolic Genius is just good church practice"**: No, it's a systemic phenomenon that emerges when all elements work together. Good practices alone don't create movement.

**"We can implement it by adding programs"**: Apostolic Genius isn't something you add; it's something you recover and activate. Programs might help, but they're not the solution.

**"It only works in certain contexts"**: The evidence from history shows Apostolic Genius working across vastly different cultures, times, and circumstances.

**"It requires special resources"**: Remarkable movements often had fewer resources, not more. The Chinese church had no buildings, no professional leadership, no mass meetings.

**"It's about church growth"**: While movements do grow, Apostolic Genius is about transformation and multiplication, not just numerical increase.

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: The systemic nature means all six elements are necessary. Missing even one prevents the system from activating.

**"Apostolic Genius is something new"**: No, it's something latent to be recovered. It's encoded in the church's being, waiting to be awakened.

**"It's too complex"**: Actually, Apostolic Genius is about simplicity—distilling to essence. Movements thrive when the message and structure are simple enough to reproduce.
