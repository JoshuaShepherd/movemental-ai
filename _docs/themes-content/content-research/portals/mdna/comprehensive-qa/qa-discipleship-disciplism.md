# Discipleship & Disciplism: Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores discipleship and disciplism—the irreplaceable task of becoming like Jesus and helping others do the same. Discipleship is multiplication through formation, ensuring that movement DNA is passed on faithfully. Disciplism emphasizes discipleship as the context for evangelism.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers discipleship as element of mDNA, disciplism as framework, disciple-making practices, multiplication through formation, and practical implementation.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from foundational understanding, to disciplism framework, to disciple-making practices, to multiplication and practical application.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to understand discipleship comprehensively, implement disciple-making, and create multiplication through formation.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: What is discipleship in the context of mDNA, and why is it essential?

**Answer:**

In the context of mDNA, discipleship is the irreplaceable task of becoming like Jesus and helping others do the same. It is multiplication through formation—not just adding people to the organization but forming them into disciples who can reproduce the movement. Disciple-making ensures that movement DNA is passed on faithfully from generation to generation.

Discipleship is essential because it's the core practice that enables multiplication. Without discipleship, movements don't multiply—they may add people, but those people don't become disciples who can reproduce the movement. Discipleship is how the DNA gets transmitted from person to person, from generation to generation.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Formation Focus:** Discipleship is about formation, not just information. It's about becoming like Jesus, not just learning about Jesus. It involves transformation, not just education.

2. **Multiplication Through Formation:** The goal is multiplication—disciples making disciples. Each disciple should be able to form other disciples, ensuring the movement multiplies.

3. **DNA Transmission:** Discipleship is how movement DNA gets transmitted. As people become disciples, they receive and internalize the DNA, then pass it on to others.

4. **Relational Context:** Discipleship happens in relationships, not just classrooms. It's about life-on-life formation, modeling, and mentoring.

5. **Holistic Formation:** Discipleship involves the whole person—mind, heart, and will. It's not just intellectual learning but transformation of character, values, and practices.

6. **Practice-Oriented:** Discipleship involves practices—things we actually do, not just things we believe. It's about living like Jesus, not just knowing about Jesus.

**Why It's Essential:**

- Movements require disciples, not just converts
- Multiplication requires disciples who can reproduce
- DNA transmission requires formation, not just addition
- Transformation requires discipleship, not just information

**Key Points:**
- Discipleship is formation, not just information
- Multiplication through formation
- DNA transmission through discipleship
- Essential for movement multiplication

**Examples:**
- Early church disciple-making
- Methodist class meetings and bands
- Chinese underground church formation

**Connections:**
- Movement DNA (mDNA) transmission
- Multiplication dynamics
- Missional-incarnational impulse

**Practical Application:**
Understanding discipleship helps churches focus on formation and multiplication rather than just addition. It shifts focus from programs to relationships, from information to formation.
