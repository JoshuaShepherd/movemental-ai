# APEST / 5Q: The Fivefold Intelligence Framework

## The Essential Definition

APEST/5Q refers to the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11, expanded into a comprehensive understanding of five forms of organizational intelligence. APEST (Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds/Pastors, Teachers) represents the ministry functions, while 5Q (Apostolic Intelligence, Prophetic Intelligence, Evangelistic Intelligence, Shepherding Intelligence, Teaching Intelligence) represents the deeper understanding of these as forms of intelligence distributed throughout the Body of Christ. The framework reveals that these five forms of intelligence are not just for leaders but are present in every believer, and all five are necessary for the church to attain "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

## The Full Explanation

The APEST/5Q framework is built on Ephesians 4:11-13, where Christ gives gifts to his church: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds (Pastors), and Teachers. But this passage reveals something deeper than just leadership roles—it reveals five forms of organizational intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ.

The evolution from APEST to 5Q represents a shift from thinking about these as ministry functions to understanding them as forms of intelligence. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.

**The Five Forms of Intelligence:**

1. **Apostolic Intelligence (AQ)**: Pioneering intelligence—extending, multiplying, architecting, mobilizing. The apostolic function extends the church into new contexts, multiplies communities, and architects systems for movement.

2. **Prophetic Intelligence (PQ)**: Discerning intelligence—challenging, calling to covenant faithfulness, exposing falsehood. The prophetic function challenges the status quo, calls people back to covenant faithfulness, and exposes falsehood.

3. **Evangelistic Intelligence (EQ)**: Recruiting intelligence—gathering, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause. The evangelistic function gathers people, proclaims the good news, and connects people to the cause of Christ.

4. **Shepherding Intelligence (SQ)**: Nurturing intelligence—caring, protecting, building community, creating belonging. The shepherding function cares for people, protects the community, and creates belonging.

5. **Teaching Intelligence (TQ)**: Grounding intelligence—explaining, equipping, systematizing, preserving truth. The teaching function explains truth, equips people, systematizes knowledge, and preserves truth.

A critical insight is that these five forms of intelligence are not limited to Christian contexts. They appear as universal archetypes throughout human culture—in business, arts, politics, education, and every domain of human endeavor. This is because they reflect the imago Dei, the image of God in humanity, and ultimately reflect aspects of God's own being. Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions, and the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature.

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. The "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents, while "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. Both are needed in dynamic tension.

Creating APEST/5Q culture means moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers. It means recognizing that every member of the Body has a vital role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world. It means creating environments where all five forms of intelligence are valued and can flourish.

## Biblical Foundations

Ephesians 4:11-13 is the foundational text: "So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

This passage reveals that:
- Christ gives these gifts to his church
- They are for equipping all people for works of service
- They are necessary for the body to reach maturity
- All are needed to attain "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ"

The passage suggests a systemic understanding—all functions are needed, working together, for the church to function as intended. The Western church has largely operated with only Shepherd and Teacher, creating an imbalanced system.

## Historical Development

The concept has been developed extensively across multiple publications:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 8, "APEST Culture" - Initial introduction
- *The Permanent Revolution* (2012, with Tim Catchim): Comprehensive treatment throughout
- *5Q: Reactivating the Original Intelligence and Capacity of the Body of Christ* (2017): Entire book dedicated to this theme
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout
- *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 5, "The Church That Jesus Built"
- *The Starfish and the Spirit* (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Integrated throughout

The framework has evolved from APEST (ministry functions) to 5Q (five forms of intelligence), showing the development from functions to a deeper understanding of organizational intelligence.

## Theological Significance

APEST/5Q matters because it reveals how God designed the church to function. It shows us that the church needs all five forms of intelligence working together to attain maturity. When we exile any function, we create an imbalanced system that cannot function as intended.

The framework has profound implications for leadership development, organizational structure, discipleship pathways, and the very nature of ministry. It calls for moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers, recognizing that every member of the Body has a vital role to play.

APEST/5Q is essential for missional movements because the APE functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents that enable adaptation and mission. Without them, the church becomes static and incapable of engaging beyond its current boundaries.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding APEST/5Q means:

1. **Activating All Five**: Ensuring all five forms of intelligence are present, valued, and working together.

2. **Distributing Ministry**: Moving beyond clergy-laity to activate the ministry of all believers.

3. **Creating 5Q Environment**: Creating culture where all five forms of intelligence can flourish.

4. **Recovering Exiled Functions**: Intentionally recovering the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions that have been exiled.

5. **Balancing Tension**: Maintaining the dynamic tension between APE (change) and ST (stability) functions.

6. **5Q Assessment**: Using 5Q framework to assess organizational health and develop strategies.

For individual believers, APEST/5Q means recognizing that you have a role to play. You're not just a consumer of ministry; you're a minister. Every believer carries elements of all five forms of intelligence, and the church needs you to activate them.

## Interconnections

APEST/5Q connects to all other mDNA elements:

- It's grounded in **"Jesus is Lord"**—Jesus perfectly embodies all five forms of intelligence
- It enables **disciple-making**—all five are needed for wholistic discipleship
- It's activated by the **missional-incarnational impulse**—APE functions enable mission
- It's enabled by **organic systems**—distributed leadership requires organic structures
- It creates **communitas**—fivefold ministry creates deeper community

APEST/5Q also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's the foundation for **Movement Dynamics**—APE functions are essential for movement
- It informs **Leadership Development**—moving beyond clergy model
- It enables **Organizational Health**—all five needed for wholistic health

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"APEST/5Q is just about leadership roles"**: No, it's about organizational intelligence distributed throughout the Body.

2. **"We only need Shepherd and Teacher"**: No, all five are needed. Exiling APE functions creates imbalance.

3. **"APEST/5Q is hierarchical"**: No, it's distributed. Every believer carries elements of all five.

4. **"It's only for ordained ministers"**: No, it's for all believers. The clergy-laity divide blocks APEST/5Q culture.

5. **"We can pick and choose functions"**: No, all five are needed to attain "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

6. **"APEST/5Q is a new idea"**: No, it's in Ephesians 4. We've just forgotten it or suppressed it.
