# Disciple-Making: The Essential Practice of Movement DNA

## The Essential Definition

Disciple-making is the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message and mission. It is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry—he did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs; he made disciples. Disciple-making is not the first step on a journey beyond which we move; it is the journey itself. We never move beyond being disciples—we are always disciples in the making.

## The Full Explanation

If you want to understand what makes missional movements so powerful, look no further than disciple-making. At the most uncomplicated level, missional movements never appear to get beyond disciple-making as a core practice. This is the practice, and the key to all lasting missional impact in and through movements. Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making.

Take, for instance, the Methodist movement, which was founded in eighteenth-century England. When John Wesley had his heart "strangely warmed" in his encounter with God, Wesley began to travel throughout Great Britain with a vision for renewal. He "sought no less than the recovery of the truth, life and power of earliest Christianity." By the end of Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement had spread to America. What was the key? According to missiologist Steve Addison, it was the high level of commitment to the Methodist cause that was expected of participants.

But here's what's telling: this cause declined when the movement lost its ethos of evangelism and disciple-making and degenerated into mere religious institutionalism. In fact, although Methodism in America had experienced massive expansion, critical "movement killers" were introduced into Methodism in America that eventually led to its decline. Tired of the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians deriding them as "uncouth," Methodist ministers had to complete four years of ordination studies in order to qualify. Classes and bands—discipleship—had become an optional extra. Methodism had lost its movemental power.

For the follower of Jesus, discipleship must not be viewed as the first step on a journey to some other destiny. We never move beyond being a disciple on the way. Yet there seems to be a massive disconnect between our language of discipleship and our actual practice of it. At best, we tend to think of it as something we do with young converts, but once they're "mature," we move them on to other things. While we have a historical language of discipleship, our actual practice of it is by and large lost. We have done so partly because we have reduced discipleship to the intellectual assimilation of ideas; and partly because systemic consumerism has made us passive recipients rather than active participants.

When we look at significant missional movements, we discover how counterintuitive their practices are—they contradict so many of our own church-growth practices. For instance, the underground Christian movement had developed what it called the catechumenate—a rigorous initiation process for new converts. These involved rigorous personal examinations that required the catechumen to prove their worthiness before they were allowed to become part of the confessing community. Not only could proposed converts lose their life, because Christianity was illegal, but they also had to prove they should be allowed to become part of the Christian community in the first place. This is completely contrary to the "seeker-sensitive" practice so prevalent in our day.

Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us. Discipleship means learning to think, feel, and act like Jesus—not just knowing about him but knowing him and being known by him in the most intimate sense.

A critical insight developed in Disciplism is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

The mDNA of discipleship involves several key elements: Jesus-shaped discipleship (centered on Christ's person and example), Shema spirituality (loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength), the inseparability of mission and discipleship (you cannot have one without the other), and the prophetic call to faithfulness (discipleship requires radical obedience).

## Biblical Foundations

The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) explicitly commands us to "make disciples of all nations." Jesus did not primarily write books, build institutions, or create programs—he made disciples. The selection and development of that motley band of followers was the foundational strategy from which the church would emerge.

Jesus' approach to disciple-making was life-on-life, taking his followers on an adventurous journey of mission, ministry, and learning. Straightaway he sent them out to do the work—preaching, healing, and casting out demons. It was active and direct disciple-making in the context of mission. The newest convert is engaged in the mission from the start.

The New Testament consistently teaches that discipleship involves embodiment and transmission. Paul writes, "You became imitators of us and of the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 1:6). He tells the Corinthians, "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" (1 Corinthians 11:1). The apostles were essentially the custodians of the DNA of God's people, and the embodiment of the gospel had to be observed as a living aspect of their ministry.

## Historical Development

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

The Methodist movement demonstrates this clearly. At its height, it required high levels of commitment and discipleship through classes and bands. When this was lost, the movement declined. The early church maintained rigorous disciple-making through the catechumenate. The Chinese underground church grew exponentially through disciple-making networks.

The concept has been developed across multiple publications:

- *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Entire book focused on missional discipleship
- *Disciplism* (2014): Entire book dedicated to reframing evangelism within discipleship
- *ReJesus* (2009, with Michael Frost): Chapter 2, "ReJesus and Personal Renewal"
- *Right Here, Right Now* (2011, with Lance Ford): Integrated throughout
- *Metanoia* (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 5, "Wholehearted Metanoia"

## Theological Significance

Discipleship matters because it is the essential task on which Jesus focused his entire ministry. If we fail here, it is unlikely that we will even get to the others. Discipleship is not an optional extra for the committed few; it is the non-negotiable core practice of the church.

The quality of the leadership in any movement is directly proportional to the quality of the discipleship. If we fail in the area of making disciples, we should not be surprised if we fail in the area of cultivating missional leadership. Leadership development must always begin with discipleship first. Discipleship, for every Christian, must always reflect Christlikeness.

Our mystical union with Christ and his indwelling with us means that we are called to be conformed to his image. This is our eternal destiny. We are called to be "little Jesuses"—an actively Christlike (redemptive) presence in every nook and cranny of society. This is what makes the message believable and transferable.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding disciple-making means:

1. **Making It Central**: Discipleship must become the central, non-negotiable practice of the church, not an optional extra.

2. **Life-on-Life Approach**: Following Jesus' model of taking people on an adventurous journey of mission, ministry, and learning.

3. **Embodiment**: Ensuring that the message is lived out, not just taught. The medium is the message.

4. **Mission Context**: Organizing discipleship around mission, because mission is the catalyzing principle that makes discipleship real.

5. **Reproducibility**: Creating simple, reproducible disciple-making systems that can be passed from person to person.

6. **Action-Learning**: Moving from thinking our way into a new way of acting to acting our way into a new way of thinking.

For individual believers, disciple-making means recognizing that we are always disciples in the making. We never graduate from discipleship. Every aspect of life is part of the journey of becoming like Jesus.

## Interconnections

Disciple-making connects to all other mDNA elements:

- It's grounded in **"Jesus is Lord"**—discipleship means becoming like Jesus
- It ensures **multiplication**—disciples make disciples
- It's activated through the **missional-incarnational impulse**—discipleship happens in mission
- It's developed through **APEST culture**—all five functions are needed for wholistic discipleship
- It's enabled by **organic systems**—simple, reproducible structures
- It's formed in **communitas**—discipleship happens in liminal community

Disciple-making also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's the foundation for **Disciplism**—evangelism within discipleship
- It enables the **Metanoia Journey**—transformation through following Jesus
- It's activated through **wholistic discipleship** practices

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"Discipleship is just for new converts"**: No, we never move beyond being disciples. Discipleship is the journey itself, not the first step.

2. **"Discipleship is about information"**: No, it's about embodiment. We learn by doing, not just by knowing.

3. **"Discipleship happens in the classroom"**: No, it happens in life, in mission, in relationship. Jesus took his disciples on the road.

4. **"Discipleship is separate from mission"**: No, you cannot have one without the other. Mission is the context for discipleship.

5. **"Discipleship is optional"**: No, it's the non-negotiable core practice. Without it, there is no movement.

6. **"We can outsource discipleship"**: No, it must be the internal, reproducible function of the local church. When we outsource it, we lose the capacity for movement.
