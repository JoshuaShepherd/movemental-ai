# Jesus is Lord (as mDNA Element): The Heart of It All

## The Essential Definition

"Jesus is Lord" is more than just a singular element of movement DNA; it is the absolute center from which all other themes radiate. This foundational confession represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema Yisrael, and eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority. When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems, but this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord.

## The Full Explanation

When persecution drives movements underground, when all external structures and reference points are removed, when access to outside sources is cut off, something remarkable happens. Movements are forced through the crucible of crisis to condense and purify their core message—the message that keeps them both faithful and effective. In this process, a miracle happens: faith is once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus, the Author and Completer of the faith.

This is exactly what happened to the early church and the Chinese underground church. When everything else was stripped away, what remained was Jesus: his person, his story, his claim on our lives. The Chinese church, cut off from all outside resources, grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years. What was going on? They had discovered the essence—the core truth that all else depends upon.

The confession "Jesus is Lord" represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema Yisrael ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, The Lord is one"). It touches on the nature of God, his relation to the world, and his covenantal relationship with his people. This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether Caesar, consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god. It is inherently political, inherently revolutionary, and inherently missional.

In the polytheistic world of the ancient Near East, people lived under the tyranny of many gods. Every sphere of life had its own deity: a god of the river, a god of the field, a god of politics, a god of fertility. Life was complex, dangerous, and fragmented. Into this context came the Shema: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one." This declaration had direct and far-reaching implications. No longer could there be different gods for different spheres of life. Rather, Yahweh is the ONE (only) God who presides over all of life—home, field, politics, work, and so on.

The incarnation does not alter the nature of God or the fundamental practical monotheism of the Scriptures; rather, it reinforms and restructures monotheism around the central character in the New Testament, Jesus Christ. He becomes the Revealer and Redeemer through whom we come to God and adhere to him. The New Testament reveals that the rule normally associated with the Father is now passed on to Jesus. As Paul says in Ephesians 1:20-23, God "placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church."

This is what I call christocentric monotheism—it realigns our loyalties to God through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the entry point in our relation to God, and it is to him that we must give our allegiance. The lordship of Jesus is not just a theological proposition to be assented to; it is a reality to be lived. It demands total allegiance, reshaping every dimension of life.

The early church rejected the claim of the overlordship of Caesar. The confession "Jesus is Lord" became in their mouths and in this context a direct political challenge to all other absolute claims to political lordship. The emperors understood this all too clearly; hence the terrible persecution. The early Christians understood the inner meaning of monotheism here. They knew that Jesus is Lord means that Caesar is not. They knew that this was the heart of the faith, and they could not, would not, compromise on it.

This situation turns out to be exactly the same for the contemporary Chinese church. They had to reject the claim of the Communist state over their lives, a claim that would effectively displace the supreme lordship of Jesus. This is the source of spiritual conflict in both cases—the clash of ultimate loyalties. Both movements were willing to die rather than deny their essential affirmation. Herein lies the heart of Apostolic Genius.

## Biblical Foundations

The confession "Jesus is Lord" finds its roots in the Shema Yisrael (Deuteronomy 6:4-5), which Jesus himself affirmed as the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-30). The New Testament consistently presents Jesus as Lord:

- 1 Corinthians 8:6: "For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live."

- Romans 10:9: "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

- Ephesians 1:20-23: God "raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion... And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church."

- 1 Corinthians 15:25-28: "For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet... When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all."

The lordship of Jesus is the central confession that gives meaning to everything else. It is the foundation upon which all other mDNA elements rest.

## Historical Development

Throughout church history, movements that have experienced exponential growth and transformative impact have maintained this central confession. When persecution forced the early church and the Chinese underground church to distill their message, what remained was "Jesus is Lord."

The early church grew from as few as 25,000 Christians in AD 100 to up to 20 million by AD 310, despite persecution and lack of resources. The Chinese underground church grew from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under severe persecution. In both cases, the simplicity of the message—Jesus is Lord—enabled it to be easily transferred from person to person, easily grasped by illiterate peasants, yet profound enough to transform entire cultures.

This theme runs throughout the corpus of work, finding particular expression in the call to "reJesus" the church—to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms. Christology determines missiology, which in turn determines ecclesiology. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right.

## Theological Significance

"Jesus is Lord" matters because it reveals something fundamental about how God designed the church to function. It shows us that the power for transformation doesn't come from external resources, programs, or strategies, but from something encoded within the very being of the church itself.

The lordship of Jesus is not just about the nature of God himself; it has practical implications for our lives. It challenges the powers, subverts the status quo, and calls forth a community that lives as if this confession is actually true. This is why movements that maintain this centrality of Christ find themselves both persecuted and powerful—persecuted because they challenge false authorities, powerful because they tap into the very source of life itself.

The confession eliminates the false separation between the "sacred" and the "secular." There is no such thing as sacred and secular in biblical monotheism—all of life must come under the claim of Yahweh's lordship. All life belongs to God, and true worship constitutes bringing all of life under this claim. This is what it means to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding "Jesus is Lord" as the central mDNA element means:

1. **Distilling to Essence**: Simplifying the message so it can be easily transferred while remaining profound enough to transform cultures.

2. **Challenging False Authorities**: Recognizing and rejecting competing claims to ultimate authority—whether consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god.

3. **All-of-Life Perspective**: Refusing the false dualism of sacred or secular, bringing every aspect of life under the lordship of Jesus.

4. **Christocentric Recalibration**: Recalibrating everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms.

5. **Political Engagement**: Understanding that the confession is inherently political and revolutionary, challenging false authorities in every sphere.

6. **Simplicity in Complexity**: Maintaining simplicity in the message while allowing complexity in application.

For individual believers, "Jesus is Lord" means recognizing that every aspect of life must come under his claim. There can be no compartmentalization, no areas of life that remain autonomous. The lordship of Jesus demands total allegiance.

## Interconnections

"Jesus is Lord" is the foundation that gives meaning to all other mDNA elements:

- It provides the **central confession** that all other elements depend upon
- It shapes **disciple-making** by defining what discipleship means—becoming like Jesus
- It informs the **missional-incarnational impulse** by showing how God engages the world
- It grounds **APEST culture** by revealing how Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions
- It enables **organic systems** by providing the organizing principle
- It creates **communitas** by calling people into shared allegiance to one Lord

The confession also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's the foundation for **Christocentrism** and **ReJesus** movements
- It enables the **Metanoia Journey** by providing the true north for transformation
- It informs **Reframation** by showing what needs to be reframed

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"It's just one element among six"**: No, it's the foundational confession that gives meaning to everything else. While it's listed as an element, it's more than that—it's the center.

2. **"It's just a theological statement"**: No, it's a reality to be lived. It demands total allegiance and reshapes every dimension of life.

3. **"It's about personal salvation only"**: No, it's inherently political and revolutionary, challenging all false authorities.

4. **"It means we can compartmentalize life"**: No, it eliminates the false separation between sacred and secular. All of life must come under the lordship of Jesus.

5. **"It's simple, so it's easy"**: No, simplicity is not the same as ease. Living under the lordship of Jesus is demanding and requires constant reorientation.

6. **"It's just about Sunday worship"**: No, it's about all of life. The lordship of Jesus extends to work, family, politics, economics, and every sphere.
