# Missional-Incarnational Impulse: Going Out and Going Deep

## The Essential Definition

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ. The missional impulse refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church, while the incarnational impulse refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts.

## The Full Explanation

When Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" (John 20:21), he was not only telling us where we are being sent, but also how we are to be sent. We are being sent here, but we are also being told how we are to be sent—incarnationally. Once again, as Christ-ian people, we are bound to follow in the way and pattern of Jesus.

The **missional impulse** refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people. This impulse is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

The missional impulse can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts. It is the sneeze that cannot be suppressed, the outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission. When this impulse is blocked—when churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches—they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact.

The **incarnational impulse** refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

Incarnational mission involves six key practices: **Presence** (full identification with culture), **Proximity** (geographic and relational closeness), **Powerlessness** (humility and vulnerability), **Prevenience** (recognizing God's work already present), **Passion** (embracing redemptive suffering), and **Proclamation** (sharing the good news). These practices enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

The missional-incarnational impulse is one of the most easily suppressed elements of mDNA, often replaced by what I call the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern. This pattern, while effective in certain contexts (m0-m1 on the missional scale), blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers. The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, and the church is intrinsically incarnational—it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

Both impulses are needed to form genuinely biblical mission. Following the missional impulse, the gospel is scattered like seeds into new contexts. Following the incarnational impulse, the seeds are embedded deep into the cultural soil. This combination is so vital to missional movements that I have come to believe it is intrinsic to the church in its apostolic form.

## Biblical Foundations

The missional-incarnational impulse finds its roots in two foundational doctrines: the missio Dei (mission of God) and the incarnation.

**Missional Foundation**: "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" (John 20:21). Mission is not primarily an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people.

**Incarnational Foundation**: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14). Just as God became fully human in Jesus, so the church must become native to its context. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously.

The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) calls the church to go into all the world, making disciples of all nations. This requires both going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational).

## Historical Development

The missional-incarnational impulse has been evident in every remarkable movement throughout history. The early church spread throughout the Roman Empire by going to people rather than expecting them to come. The Celtic missionary movement engaged culture deeply, becoming native to each context. The Chinese underground church embedded itself in communities, becoming part of the fabric of society.

The concept has been developed across multiple publications:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 6, "Missional-Incarnational Impulse"
- *Untamed* (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 9, "Going Out, Going Deep"
- *Right Here, Right Now* (2011, with Lance Ford): Throughout
- *Reframation* (2020, with Mark Nelson): Chapter 10, "Romancing the City"
- *Fast Forward to Mission* (2023): Both chapters, especially "Briefing Right Here"
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout

## Theological Significance

The missional-incarnational impulse matters because it reveals how God designed the church to engage the world. It shows us that mission is not about bringing people to our turf, in our cultural zone, but about going to them and becoming native to their context.

The impulse ensures that the church never becomes a fortress from the world but always remains a force for the world, engaging culture with both prophetic challenge and redemptive love. It's the practical outworking of the missionary God who sends the church outward into the world and deep into culture and context.

The combination of missional and incarnational is critical because each alone is insufficient. Missional without incarnational becomes impositional. Incarnational without missional becomes accommodation. Together, they create authentic engagement.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding the missional-incarnational impulse means:

1. **Going to Them**: Shifting from attractional (come to us) to missional (go to them) approaches.

2. **Becoming Native**: Engaging culture deeply, becoming part of the fabric of communities rather than remaining foreign.

3. **The Six P's**: Practicing Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, and Proclamation.

4. **Contextualization**: Learning to "enflesh" the gospel in ways that make sense to each context.

5. **Third Places**: Engaging in the spaces where people naturally gather—coffee shops, pubs, sports clubs, etc.

6. **Church Follows Mission**: Understanding that church forms emerge from mission engagement, not the other way around.

For individual believers, the missional-incarnational impulse means recognizing that mission happens in everyday life, in the places we already inhabit, with the people we already know. We don't need to go far to be missional; we need to go deep where we are.

## Interconnections

The missional-incarnational impulse connects to all other mDNA elements:

- It's grounded in **"Jesus is Lord"**—following Jesus' pattern of engagement
- It's the context for **disciple-making**—discipleship happens in mission
- It requires **APEST culture**—especially apostolic and evangelistic functions
- It's enabled by **organic systems**—flexible structures that can adapt
- It creates **communitas**—shared mission forms transformative community

The impulse also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's the foundation for **incarnational mission** practices
- It enables **contextualization** of the gospel
- It informs **third-place** communities
- It's activated through **Fast Forward to Mission** movements

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"Missional and incarnational are the same thing"**: No, they're twin movements that work together. Missional is going out; incarnational is going deep.

2. **"It's about being relevant"**: No, it's about being authentic. We don't change the gospel to fit culture; we embed it authentically in culture.

3. **"It means we can't have buildings"**: No, it means buildings serve mission, not the other way around. The question is: does this structure enable or block mission?

4. **"It's only for church planters"**: No, it's for every believer. Mission happens in everyday life.

5. **"It means compromising the gospel"**: No, authentic incarnation means the gospel is embedded authentically, not compromised. Syncretism is the danger, not incarnation.

6. **"Attractional is wrong"**: No, attractional can be effective in certain contexts (m0-m1). The problem is when it's the only approach, blocking engagement beyond cultural barriers.
