# Organic Systems: Movemental Structures That Enable Reproduction

## The Essential Definition

Organic systems are movemental structures designed to support mission and enable reproduction. Unlike institutional systems that rely on hierarchy, control, and centralized authority, organic systems function like living organisms—they are decentralized, distributed, self-organizing, and capable of reproduction from any part. Organic systems enable movements to scale while maintaining their core DNA, allowing exponential rather than linear growth through viral-like reproduction patterns.

## The Full Explanation

How do movements manage to get to scale while maintaining their core ideas and DNA? How do they maintain the core ideas and values while encouraging adaptation to new contexts? How do they pass ideas on? These questions get to the heart of what makes movements so powerful—and they all point to the importance of organic systems.

Structure and organization are extremely important, and they are necessary for any movement to function. But here's the crucial distinction: while structures are designed to support the mission, over time they often seem to take on a life of their own. Anyone who has tried to change an institution knows how resistant one can be to any change. The system itself becomes the problem.

In this chapter, we probe how the church in its most remarkable form organizes itself as a living organism that is entirely consistent with how God has designed and structured life itself. The problem is that mechanistic metaphors—that have become dominant and have damaged our capacity to think organically about the church.

The Bible uses organic images throughout: the church as a body (1 Corinthians 12), as a vine (John 15), as a building made of living stones (1 Peter 2:5), as a tree (Romans 11), as a temple (Ephesians 2:21). These organic images suggest that the church is designed to function like a living system, not a machine.

Organic systems function like living organisms. They are:
- **Decentralized**: Power and function are distributed, not centralized
- **Distributed**: The whole is present in every part
- **Self-organizing**: They organize themselves around purpose and principles
- **Reproducible**: Each part contains the potential of the whole
- **Adaptive**: They can adapt to new contexts while maintaining core DNA

Think of it this way: a spider has a head (central control) and legs (dependent parts)—cut off the head and the spider dies. A starfish has a distributed nervous system—cut it in half and you get two starfish. Movements operate like starfish: they are decentralized, distributed, and can reproduce from any part.

The early church organized itself organically. It was a network of communities, not a centralized institution. Each community contained the whole—it could reproduce itself. The Chinese underground church organized itself organically—decentralized networks that could reproduce rapidly.

Organic systems enable movements to scale through viral-like reproduction. Like biological reproduction, where each cell contains the whole DNA, each part of an organic movement contains the potential of the whole. This enables exponential growth—not just addition, but multiplication.

## Biblical Foundations

The Bible uses organic metaphors throughout to describe the church:
- **Body**: "Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it" (1 Corinthians 12:27)
- **Vine**: "I am the vine; you are the branches" (John 15:5)
- **Living Stones**: "You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house" (1 Peter 2:5)
- **Tree**: The olive tree imagery in Romans 11
- **Temple**: "In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple" (Ephesians 2:21)

These organic images suggest that the church is designed to function like a living system, not a machine. The church is an organism, not just an organization.

The book of Acts shows the early church organizing organically—as a network of communities that could reproduce. Each community contained the whole and could reproduce itself.

## Historical Development

The concept of organic systems has been evident in every remarkable movement throughout history. The early church organized itself as a network, not a hierarchy. The Chinese underground church organized itself organically—decentralized networks that could reproduce rapidly.

The concept has been developed across multiple publications:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 9, "Organic Systems"
- *The Starfish and the Spirit* (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Comprehensive exploration
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Application to large churches

## Theological Significance

Organic systems matter because they reveal how God designed the church to function. They show us that the church is meant to be a living organism, not a machine. This has profound implications for how we organize, structure, and reproduce.

Organic systems enable movements to scale while maintaining core DNA. They allow exponential growth through viral-like reproduction. They enable adaptation to new contexts while maintaining essential characteristics.

The distinction between organic and institutional is crucial. Institutions tend toward hierarchy, control, and centralized authority. Organic systems tend toward networks, distribution, and decentralized authority. Movements need organic systems.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding organic systems means:

1. **Network Thinking**: Moving from hierarchy to networks, from centralized to distributed.

2. **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that each part contains the potential of the whole, enabling reproduction from any part.

3. **Decentralization**: Distributing power and function to the lowest level possible.

4. **Self-Organization**: Creating systems that organize themselves around purpose and principles.

5. **Viral Reproduction**: Enabling exponential growth through viral-like reproduction patterns.

6. **Adaptive Structures**: Creating structures that can adapt to new contexts while maintaining core DNA.

For individual believers, organic systems mean recognizing that every part of the body has a role to play. We don't need to wait for permission from the center. The DNA is in us, and we can reproduce from where we are.

## Interconnections

Organic systems connect to all other mDNA elements:

- They're enabled by **"Jesus is Lord"**—providing the organizing principle
- They support **disciple-making**—enabling reproduction through disciples
- They're activated by the **missional-incarnational impulse**—mission requires flexible structures
- They're enabled by **APEST culture**—distributed leadership functions
- They create **communitas**—organic structures enable deeper community

Organic systems also connect to broader frameworks:
- They're the foundation for **Movement Dynamics**—how movements scale
- They enable **Network Structures**—decentralized organization
- They support **Viral Reproduction**—exponential growth

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"Organic means no structure"**: No, organic systems have structure, but it's living structure, not mechanical structure.

2. **"Organic means chaos"**: No, it's order at the edge of chaos. It's structured enough to hold together, fluid enough to adapt.

3. **"We need hierarchy"**: No, movements need networks. Hierarchy tends to block reproduction and adaptation.

4. **"Organic is inefficient"**: No, organic systems are highly efficient at reproduction and adaptation. They're just different from mechanical systems.

5. **"We can't have both"**: Yes, we can. We need structure, but it should be organic structure that enables movement, not blocks it.

6. **"Organic is just a metaphor"**: No, it's how God designed the church to function. The Bible uses organic images because that's what the church is.
