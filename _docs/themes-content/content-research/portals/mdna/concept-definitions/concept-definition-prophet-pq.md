# Prophet (PQ): Discerning Intelligence

## The Essential Definition

Prophet (Prophetic Intelligence or PQ) is the discerning form of organizational intelligence that challenges the status quo, calls people to covenant faithfulness, and exposes falsehood. Prophets see what others miss, discern what's really going on, and call people back to God's purposes. The prophetic function is essential for missional movements because it provides the critical voice that challenges drift and calls for faithfulness.

## The Full Explanation

Prophetic intelligence (PQ) is the discerning form of organizational intelligence. Prophets are:
- **Challengers**: They challenge the status quo, calling out drift and compromise
- **Discerners**: They see what others miss, discerning what's really going on
- **Covenant Keepers**: They call people back to covenant faithfulness
- **Truth Tellers**: They expose falsehood and speak truth to power
- **Future Seers**: They see where things are heading and call for course correction

The prophetic function is essential for missional movements because movements need someone to challenge drift, call for faithfulness, and expose falsehood. Without prophets, the church can drift from its calling without realizing it.

Prophets are often misunderstood because their message is challenging. They're not just predictors of the future; they're discerners of the present who call for faithfulness. They see what others miss and aren't afraid to speak truth.

## Biblical Foundations

The prophetic function is evident throughout Scripture, from the Old Testament prophets to John the Baptist to the New Testament emphasis on prophecy. Prophets challenge, discern, and call for faithfulness.

## Historical Development

The concept has been developed across multiple publications, emphasizing the importance of the prophetic function for movements.

## Theological Significance

Prophetic intelligence matters because movements need discernment. Without prophets, the church can drift from its calling. The prophetic function provides the critical voice that challenges and calls for faithfulness.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding prophetic intelligence means:
1. Creating space for prophetic voices
2. Listening to challenging messages
3. Discerning what's really going on
4. Calling for covenant faithfulness
5. Exposing falsehood
6. Course correcting when needed
