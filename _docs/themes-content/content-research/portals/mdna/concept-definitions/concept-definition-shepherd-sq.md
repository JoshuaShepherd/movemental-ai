# Shepherd (SQ): Nurturing Intelligence

## The Essential Definition

Shepherd (Shepherding Intelligence or SQ) is the nurturing form of organizational intelligence that cares for people, protects the community, and creates belonging. Shepherds are the caregivers, the protectors, the ones who ensure people are known, loved, and cared for. The shepherding function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can create safe spaces, build community, and ensure people are cared for.

## The Full Explanation

Shepherding intelligence (SQ) is the nurturing form of organizational intelligence. Shepherds are:
- **Caregivers**: They care for people, ensuring they are known and loved
- **Protectors**: They protect the community, creating safe spaces
- **Builders**: They build community, creating belonging
- **Nurturers**: They nurture growth and development
- **Pastors**: They pastor people, providing guidance and support

The shepherding function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can create safe spaces and build community. Without shepherds, the movement cannot sustain itself or care for its people.

Shepherds are often the most recognized function in the Western church, but they're often reduced to pastoral care or counseling. True shepherding intelligence is about creating environments where people can grow, be known, and find belonging.

## Biblical Foundations

The shepherding function is evident throughout Scripture, from the Old Testament image of God as shepherd to Jesus as the good shepherd to the New Testament emphasis on pastoral care. Shepherds care for, protect, and nurture the flock.

## Historical Development

The concept has been developed across multiple publications, emphasizing the importance of the shepherding function for movements.

## Theological Significance

Shepherding intelligence matters because movements need care. Without shepherds, the movement cannot sustain itself or care for its people. The shepherding function is essential for community and belonging.

## Practical Implications

1. Valuing the shepherding function
2. Creating space for pastoral care
3. Building community and belonging
4. Caring for people
5. Protecting the community
6. Nurturing growth and development
