# What is Movement DNA (mDNA)?

## Direct Answer

Movement DNA (mDNA) consists of six essential elements that must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to activate: Jesus is Lord (the central confession), Disciple-Making (multiplication through formation), Missional-Incarnational Impulse (going out and going deep), APEST Culture (the fivefold ministry environment), Organic Systems (movemental structures), and Communitas (liminal community). Like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every living cell of the church, contains all genetic information needed to reproduce the whole organism, is self-replicating, and can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated.

The DNA metaphor is intentionally chosen because mDNA functions like biological DNA: it's found in every genuine expression of church, contains all the information needed to reproduce the whole movement, is self-replicating (can be passed from one generation to the next), carries vital information for healthy reproduction, and can be suppressed or dormant but can be reactivated. The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic—each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. All six elements must be present and working together for the system to activate and create transformative movements.

## Expanded Explanation

The concept of movement DNA emerged from studying remarkable movements throughout history—the early church, the Chinese underground church, the Celtic missions, the Moravians, the Methodists. Despite vastly different contexts, times, and circumstances, these movements all demonstrated the same six elements working together. This consistency suggested a pattern—a genetic code that enables movement.

Each element of mDNA is an irreducible and essential component of the system. mDNA is a concentrated area of focus composed of a complex of theology, practice, and organization that, when working together, encodes movement into the very life and structures of the church. Think of each element as one of six originating instincts—built-in instincts that seem to guide the patterns of behavior of authentic Jesus movements.

The six elements work together as an integrated system:

1. **Jesus is Lord** - The central confession that gives meaning to everything else. This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession that provides the center from which all other elements radiate.

2. **Disciple-Making** - The irreplaceable task of becoming like Jesus and making others like him. This ensures multiplication through formation rather than just addition through attraction.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational), extending the gospel outward and embedding it deeply within culture.

4. **APEST Culture** - The fivefold ministry environment (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) that activates all functions and distributes ministry throughout the Body.

5. **Organic Systems** - Movemental structures that enable reproduction, operating like living organisms rather than machines.

6. **Communitas** - Liminal community formed in shared ordeal and purpose, creating deep togetherness through shared adventure.

When all six elements are present and functioning together, something remarkable happens: Apostolic Genius emerges. It's not just that you have six good things happening; it's that the system itself becomes something greater than the sum of its parts.

The systemic nature of mDNA means that partial solutions won't work. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate. This is why churches can be doing many good things—good discipleship, good mission, good community—and still not experience the transformative power of movement.

Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of mDNA is that it's latent in every expression of church. The future lies in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the very heart of every local church, waiting to be awakened. We don't need to create something new; we need to recover what's been forgotten.

## Key Points

- **Six essential elements**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas.

- **Systemic nature**: Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. All six must work together for the system to activate.

- **DNA metaphor**: Like biological DNA, mDNA is found in every cell, contains all information needed to reproduce, is self-replicating, and can be reactivated.

- **Latent potential**: mDNA is already present in every church, waiting to be recovered and activated.

- **Evidence from history**: Every remarkable movement demonstrates all six elements working together.

- **Emergent property**: When all elements work together, Apostolic Genius emerges as something greater than the sum of parts.

- **Not a program**: mDNA is not something you implement but something you recover and activate.

- **Universal pattern**: The consistency across different cultures, times, and circumstances suggests mDNA is inherent to the church's design.

## Practical Application

To activate mDNA in your church, begin by assessing which elements are present, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Use the mDNA framework as a diagnostic tool to understand your church's current state. Be honest about what's working and what's not.

Recognize that all six elements are necessary. You can't pick and choose which elements to focus on. If you're missing even one element, the system won't activate. This means you need to work on all six elements simultaneously, though you may need to prioritize based on your context.

Understand that mDNA is latent, not absent. The task is recovery and activation, not creation. You don't need to import an alien system; you need to recover what's been forgotten. This requires prayer, the work of the Holy Spirit, passionate love of God, and intentional embedding of mDNA elements.

Create conditions where mDNA can emerge. This involves:
- Centering everything on Jesus is Lord
- Prioritizing disciple-making as the core practice
- Developing missional-incarnational practices
- Activating APEST culture throughout the church
- Building organic systems that enable reproduction
- Creating liminal experiences that form communitas

Be patient. Activating mDNA takes time. It's not about quick fixes but systemic change. Like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation, movement builds through consistent effort over time.

Distill to essence. Movements thrive when the message and structure are simple enough to reproduce. Don't overcomplicate. Focus on the core elements and let them work together.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates mDNA in action. They had all six elements: Jesus is Lord at the center, disciple-making as the core practice, missional-incarnational impulse extending outward, APEST culture activating fivefold ministry, organic systems enabling reproduction, and communitas forming in liminal spaces. Despite having no buildings, no professional leadership, and no formal institutions, they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries.

The Chinese underground church shows mDNA working under severe persecution. With no buildings, no central organization, and no mass meetings, they demonstrated all six elements and grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years. The mDNA was present and active, enabling movement even in the most difficult circumstances.

The Methodist movement under John Wesley demonstrates mDNA. During Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women became Methodists. The movement had all six elements working together: Jesus is Lord, rigorous disciple-making, missional-incarnational engagement, APEST culture (Wesley himself was apostolic, and the movement activated all functions), organic systems (class meetings, societies, circuits), and communitas (formed through shared mission and discipline).

Contemporary churches that have activated mDNA show similar patterns. They center on Jesus is Lord, prioritize disciple-making, engage missionally and incarnationally, activate APEST culture throughout, build organic systems, and create communitas through shared adventure. These churches experience multiplication and movement rather than just addition and growth.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: No, all six are necessary. The system won't activate if any element is missing. You can't pick and choose.

**"mDNA is a program we can implement"**: No, it's a genetic code that's already present. The task is recovery and activation, not creation or implementation of a program.

**"Some elements are more important than others"**: While contexts may require different emphasis, all elements are necessary for the system to function. Jesus is Lord is foundational, but all six are essential.

**"mDNA only works in certain contexts"**: The evidence shows mDNA working across vastly different cultures, times, and circumstances. It's not culturally bound.

**"We need to create mDNA"**: No, mDNA is latent in every church. We need to recover what's been forgotten, not create something new.

**"mDNA is about church growth"**: While movements do grow, mDNA is about transformation and multiplication, not just numerical increase. It's about becoming a movement, not just growing an organization.

**"We can add mDNA to what we're already doing"**: mDNA requires systemic change, not just adding new activities. It's about recovering the church's movemental nature, not adding programs.

**"mDNA is too complex"**: Actually, mDNA is about simplicity—distilling to essence. Movements thrive when the message and structure are simple enough to reproduce.
