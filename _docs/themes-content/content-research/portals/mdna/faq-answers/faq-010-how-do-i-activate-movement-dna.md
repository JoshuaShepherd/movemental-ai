# How Do I Activate Movement DNA in My Church?

## Direct Answer

To activate movement DNA (mDNA) in your church, begin by recognizing that mDNA is already present—it's latent in every expression of church, waiting to be recovered and activated. The task is not to create something new but to recover what's been forgotten. Start by assessing which of the six elements are present, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Use the mDNA framework as a diagnostic tool to understand your church's current state, then work intentionally to embed all six elements: Jesus is Lord (the central confession), Disciple-Making (multiplication through formation), Missional-Incarnational Impulse (going out and going deep), APEST Culture (the fivefold ministry environment), Organic Systems (movemental structures), and Communitas (liminal community).

Activation requires creating conditions where all six elements can work together. This involves centering everything on Jesus is Lord, prioritizing disciple-making as the core practice, developing missional-incarnational practices, activating APEST culture throughout the church, building organic systems that enable reproduction, and creating liminal experiences that form communitas. Remember that mDNA is systemic—all six elements are necessary. You can't pick and choose. Be patient, as activation takes time and consistent effort. Like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation, movement builds through consistent application of the six elements over time.

## Expanded Explanation

The most encouraging aspect of mDNA is that it's latent in every expression of church. The future lies in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the very heart of every local church, waiting to be awakened. We don't need to create something new; we need to recover what's been forgotten.

Activating mDNA begins with assessment. Use the mDNA framework to diagnose which elements are present and functioning, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Be honest about your church's current state. This requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit. You can't activate mDNA through human effort alone, but you can create conditions where it can emerge.

The six elements work together as an integrated system:

1. **Jesus is Lord** - The central confession that gives meaning to everything else. This is not merely one element among six; it is the foundational confession. To activate this, center everything on Jesus. Make "Jesus is Lord" the organizing principle of your church's life and mission.

2. **Disciple-Making** - The irreplaceable task of becoming like Jesus and making others like him. To activate this, prioritize disciple-making as the core practice. Make it the non-negotiable center of everything you do. Develop processes and relationships that enable disciples to make disciples.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** - Going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). To activate this, develop practices that send people out and embed the gospel in culture. Practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

4. **APEST Culture** - The fivefold ministry environment that activates all functions. To activate this, recognize and release all five functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) throughout the Body. Don't limit ministry to paid staff or official positions.

5. **Organic Systems** - Movemental structures that enable reproduction. To activate this, build systems that operate like living organisms rather than machines. Use simple rules, common language, and distributed leadership.

6. **Communitas** - Liminal community formed in shared ordeal and purpose. To activate this, create liminal experiences—shared adventure, risk, and purpose that form deep togetherness.

The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate.

Activation requires patience. Like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation, movement builds through consistent effort over time. Don't expect immediate results. Focus on embedding the elements consistently, and trust that the Holy Spirit will do the work of activation.

Activation also requires simplicity. Movements thrive when the message and structure are simple enough to reproduce. Don't overcomplicate. Focus on the core elements and let them work together.

## Key Points

- **Already present**: mDNA is latent in every church, waiting to be recovered and activated.

- **Systemic nature**: All six elements are necessary. You can't pick and choose.

- **Assessment first**: Use the mDNA framework to diagnose which elements are present, missing, or suppressed.

- **Create conditions**: You can't engineer activation, but you can create conditions where it can emerge.

- **Patience required**: Activation takes time and consistent effort. Like a flywheel, momentum builds over time.

- **Simplicity**: Movements thrive when message and structure are simple enough to reproduce.

- **Holy Spirit**: Activation requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit.

- **All six elements**: Jesus is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas.

## Practical Application

Begin with assessment. Use the mDNA framework to evaluate your church:
- Which elements are present and functioning?
- Which elements are missing?
- Which elements are suppressed?

Be honest about your current state. This requires prayer, discernment, and input from others. Don't try to do this alone.

Create conditions for activation. This involves:
- **Centering on Jesus is Lord**: Make this the organizing principle of everything. Every decision, every practice, every structure should flow from this confession.

- **Prioritizing Disciple-Making**: Make it the non-negotiable core practice. Develop processes and relationships that enable disciples to make disciples. Everything else serves this purpose.

- **Developing Missional-Incarnational Practices**: Send people out. Embed the gospel in culture. Practice the six practices of incarnation: presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

- **Activating APEST Culture**: Recognize and release all five functions throughout the Body. Don't limit ministry to paid staff. Create space for apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers to function.

- **Building Organic Systems**: Create systems that operate like living organisms. Use simple rules, common language, and distributed leadership. Enable reproduction rather than just addition.

- **Creating Communitas**: Create liminal experiences—shared adventure, risk, and purpose. Don't just create comfortable community; create communitas through shared mission.

Work on all six elements simultaneously. Remember that mDNA is systemic. You can't focus on just one or two elements and expect movement. All six must be present and working together.

Be patient. Activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Don't expect immediate results. Focus on being faithful in embedding the elements, and trust that the Holy Spirit will do the work of activation.

Distill to essence. Movements thrive when the message and structure are simple enough to reproduce. Don't overcomplicate. Focus on the core elements and let them work together.

Pray and discern. Activation requires the work of the Holy Spirit. Pray for activation. Discern where God is already at work. Join what God is doing rather than trying to engineer something yourself.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates mDNA activation. They had all six elements working together: Jesus is Lord at the center, disciple-making as the core practice, missional-incarnational impulse extending outward, APEST culture activating fivefold ministry, organic systems enabling reproduction, and communitas forming in liminal spaces. Despite having no buildings, no professional leadership, and no formal institutions, they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries.

The Chinese underground church shows mDNA activation under severe persecution. With no buildings, no central organization, and no mass meetings, they demonstrated all six elements and grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years. The mDNA was present and active, enabling movement even in the most difficult circumstances.

Contemporary churches that have activated mDNA show similar patterns. They center on Jesus is Lord, prioritize disciple-making, engage missionally and incarnationally, activate APEST culture throughout, build organic systems, and create communitas through shared adventure. These churches experience multiplication and movement rather than just addition and growth.

The Methodist movement under Wesley demonstrates mDNA activation. During Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women became Methodists. The movement had all six elements: Jesus is Lord, rigorous disciple-making, missional-incarnational engagement, APEST culture (Wesley himself was apostolic, and the movement activated all functions), organic systems (class meetings, societies, circuits), and communitas (formed through shared mission and discipline).

## Common Misunderstandings

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: No, all six are necessary. The system won't activate if any element is missing.

**"mDNA is a program we can implement"**: No, it's a genetic code that's already present. The task is recovery and activation, not creation or implementation of a program.

**"Activation happens quickly"**: Activation takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Be patient.

**"We need to create mDNA"**: No, mDNA is latent in every church. We need to recover what's been forgotten, not create something new.

**"Activation is about adding programs"**: Activation is about embedding elements, not adding programs. Programs might help, but they're not the solution.

**"Some elements are more important than others"**: While contexts may require different emphasis, all elements are necessary for the system to function.

**"Activation is just about leadership"**: Activation requires the whole church, not just leadership. Everyone has a role to play.

**"We can activate mDNA through human effort alone"**: Activation requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit. You can create conditions, but the Holy Spirit does the activation.
