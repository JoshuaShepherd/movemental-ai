# How Do I Embed mDNA in My Church?

## Direct Answer

To embed movement DNA (mDNA) in your church, begin by recognizing that mDNA is already present—it's latent in every expression of church, waiting to be recovered and activated. The task is not to import something foreign but to recover what's been forgotten. Start with assessment: use the mDNA framework to diagnose which of the six elements are present and functioning, which are missing, and which are suppressed. Then work intentionally to embed all six elements throughout your church's life: Jesus is Lord (make this the organizing principle of everything), Disciple-Making (prioritize as the core practice), Missional-Incarnational Impulse (develop sending and embedding practices), APEST Culture (recognize and release all five functions), Organic Systems (build movemental structures), and Communitas (create liminal experiences).

Embedding mDNA requires systemic change, not just adding programs. It means shifting how you think (paradigm), how you feel and organize (platform), and how you act (practices). All three levels must be aligned. Work on all six elements simultaneously, as mDNA is systemic—each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. Be patient, as embedding takes time and consistent effort. Like a flywheel that gains momentum with each rotation, movement builds through consistent application of the six elements over time.

## Expanded Explanation

Embedding mDNA is fundamentally about recovery, not creation. The future lies in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the very heart of every local church, waiting to be awakened. We don't need to create something new; we need to recover what's been forgotten.

The process of embedding follows the Paradigm-Platform-Practices framework:

**Paradigm (Organizational Mind)**: Shift how you think about church and mission. Move from institution-centered to movement-centered thinking. Recognize that the church is designed to be a movement, not just an organization. Understand that mDNA is systemic—all six elements must work together.

**Platform (Organizational Soul)**: Change your culture and structures. Develop a culture that values all six elements. Create structures that support movement rather than just maintenance. Build systems that enable reproduction rather than just addition.

**Practices (Organizational Will)**: Develop observable, repeatable behaviors that embody mDNA. Create practices that center on Jesus is Lord, prioritize disciple-making, send people out, activate APEST, build organic systems, and form communitas.

Embedding requires working on all six elements simultaneously:

1. **Jesus is Lord**: Make this the organizing principle. Every decision, every practice, every structure should flow from this confession. Center worship, teaching, and mission on Jesus.

2. **Disciple-Making**: Prioritize as the core practice. Make it the non-negotiable center. Develop processes and relationships that enable disciples to make disciples. Everything else serves this purpose.

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Develop sending and embedding practices. Send people out. Embed the gospel in culture. Practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation.

4. **APEST Culture**: Recognize and release all five functions throughout the Body. Don't limit ministry to paid staff. Create space for apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers to function.

5. **Organic Systems**: Build systems that operate like living organisms. Use simple rules, common language, and distributed leadership. Enable reproduction rather than just addition.

6. **Communitas**: Create liminal experiences—shared adventure, risk, and purpose. Don't just create comfortable community; create communitas through shared mission.

The crucial insight is that mDNA is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate.

Embedding takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Don't expect immediate results. Focus on being faithful in embedding the elements, and trust that the Holy Spirit will do the work of activation.

## Key Points

- **Recovery, not creation**: mDNA is already present. The task is to recover what's been forgotten.

- **Systemic change**: Embedding requires shifting paradigm, platform, and practices—all three levels.

- **All six elements**: Work on all six simultaneously. You can't pick and choose.

- **Assessment first**: Use the mDNA framework to diagnose which elements are present, missing, or suppressed.

- **Patience required**: Embedding takes time and consistent effort. Like a flywheel, momentum builds over time.

- **Simple rules**: Movements thrive when message and structure are simple enough to reproduce.

- **Holy Spirit**: Embedding requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit.

- **Not just programs**: Embedding is about systemic change, not just adding programs.

## Practical Application

Begin with assessment. Use the mDNA framework to evaluate your church:
- Which elements are present and functioning?
- Which elements are missing?
- Which elements are suppressed?

Be honest about your current state. This requires prayer, discernment, and input from others.

Work on all six elements simultaneously. Remember that mDNA is systemic. You can't focus on just one or two elements and expect movement. All six must be present and working together.

Embed at three levels:
- **Paradigm**: Shift thinking about church and mission. Help people understand that the church is designed to be a movement.
- **Platform**: Change culture and structures. Develop culture that values all six elements. Create structures that support movement.
- **Practices**: Develop observable behaviors. Create practices that embody mDNA.

For each element, develop specific practices:
- **Jesus is Lord**: Center everything on Jesus. Make this the organizing principle.
- **Disciple-Making**: Prioritize as core practice. Develop disciple-making processes.
- **Missional-Incarnational**: Send people out. Embed gospel in culture.
- **APEST**: Recognize and release all five functions.
- **Organic Systems**: Build movemental structures.
- **Communitas**: Create liminal experiences.

Be patient. Embedding takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Don't expect immediate results.

Distill to essence. Movements thrive when message and structure are simple enough to reproduce. Don't overcomplicate. Focus on core elements.

Pray and discern. Embedding requires the work of the Holy Spirit. Pray for embedding. Discern where God is already at work.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates mDNA embedded. They had all six elements working together: Jesus is Lord at the center, disciple-making as the core practice, missional-incarnational impulse extending outward, APEST culture activating fivefold ministry, organic systems enabling reproduction, and communitas forming in liminal spaces.

Contemporary churches that have embedded mDNA show similar patterns. They center on Jesus is Lord, prioritize disciple-making, engage missionally and incarnationally, activate APEST culture throughout, build organic systems, and create communitas through shared adventure. These churches experience multiplication and movement.

The Methodist movement under Wesley shows mDNA embedded. During Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women became Methodists. The movement had all six elements: Jesus is Lord, rigorous disciple-making, missional-incarnational engagement, APEST culture, organic systems (class meetings, societies, circuits), and communitas.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Embedding means adding programs"**: No, embedding is about systemic change, not just adding programs. Programs might help, but they're not the solution.

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: No, all six are necessary. The system won't activate if any element is missing.

**"Embedding happens quickly"**: Embedding takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time.

**"We need to create mDNA"**: No, mDNA is latent in every church. We need to recover what's been forgotten.

**"Embedding is just about leadership"**: Embedding requires the whole church, not just leadership. Everyone has a role to play.

**"Embedding is about structure only"**: Embedding requires shifting paradigm, platform, and practices—all three levels.

**"We can embed through human effort alone"**: Embedding requires prayer, discernment, and the work of the Holy Spirit.
