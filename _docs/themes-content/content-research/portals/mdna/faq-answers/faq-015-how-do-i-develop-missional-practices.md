# How Do I Develop Missional Practices?

## Direct Answer

To develop missional practices, begin by shifting your understanding of mission from church-centered to God-centered. Recognize that God is already at work in your community, and your role is to join what God is doing. Start by identifying where God is already active—the "nooks and crannies" where people gather, relationships form, and life happens. Then develop practices that embody the missional-incarnational impulse: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). Practice the six practices of incarnation: **Presence** (being fully present in spaces where people live and work), **Proximity** (building geographic and relational closeness), **Powerlessness** (approaching with humility rather than trying to control), **Prevenience** (recognizing God's work already present and joining it), **Passion** (embracing redemptive suffering, being willing to enter into pain and brokenness), and **Proclamation** (sharing good news in ways that make sense to your context).

Develop practices that become part of everyday life, not just scheduled activities. Shift from programs to practices—from events people attend to habits people live. Create rhythms that include both gathering and scattering. Measure success by sending and multiplication rather than just attendance and addition. Be patient, as developing missional practices takes time and consistent effort. Focus on being faithful in the practices, and trust that God will work through them.

## Expanded Explanation

Missional practices are not about adding outreach activities to an otherwise attractional approach. They're about fundamentally shifting how you engage with the world. The missional church recognizes that it is intrinsically incarnational; it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

The six practices of incarnation provide a practical framework:

1. **Presence**: Full identification with culture, being fully present in the spaces where people live and work. This means being there, not just visiting. It's about full engagement, not extraction.

2. **Proximity**: Geographic and relational closeness. You can't be missional from a distance. You need to be close enough to understand and engage. This might mean relocating, changing how you spend your time, or intentionally entering spaces you've previously avoided.

3. **Powerlessness**: Approaching with humility rather than trying to control or fix. Be a learner, not an expert. Ask questions rather than giving answers. Come as a neighbor, not as a savior.

4. **Prevenience**: Recognizing God's work already present. You don't bring God to places; you join God where God already is. Look for where God is already active and join it rather than trying to start something new.

5. **Passion**: Embracing redemptive suffering, being willing to enter into the pain and brokenness of your context. Don't avoid difficult places. Be willing to suffer with people, not just for them.

6. **Proclamation**: Sharing the good news in ways that make sense to your context. Speak the language of the culture while maintaining the integrity of the gospel. Contextualize without compromising.

Developing missional practices means shifting from programs to practices—from events people attend to habits people live. Practices become part of everyday life, not just scheduled activities. They're integrated into how you live, work, and relate, not compartmentalized into church activities.

Missional practices also involve shifting metrics. Instead of measuring success by Sunday attendance, measure by:
- How many people are being sent out
- How many missional communities are forming
- How the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces
- How relationships are forming in the community

- **Integrated, not compartmentalized**: Practices are integrated into everyday life, not separate activities.

## Practical Application

Start by identifying where God is already at work in your community. Practice "soft eyes"—the ability to see where God is already active. Look for the "nooks and crannies" where people gather, relationships form, and life happens.

Develop the six practices of incarnation:
- **Presence**: Be fully present in spaces where people live and work. Don't be distracted or in a hurry.
- **Proximity**: Build geographic and relational closeness. Live in the community you're called to reach.
- **Powerlessness**: Approach with humility. Be a learner, not an expert. Ask questions rather than giving answers.
- **Prevenience**: Look for where God is already at work. Join it rather than trying to start something new.
- **Passion**: Be willing to enter into the pain and brokenness of your context. Don't avoid difficult places.
- **Proclamation**: Share good news in ways that make sense to your context. Speak the language of the culture.

Shift from programs to practices. Develop habits that become part of everyday life, not just scheduled activities. Create rhythms that include both gathering and scattering.

Shift your metrics. Measure success by sending and multiplication rather than just attendance and addition. Create structures that support sending rather than just gathering.

Be patient. Developing missional practices takes time. Focus on being faithful in the practices, and trust that God will work through them.
