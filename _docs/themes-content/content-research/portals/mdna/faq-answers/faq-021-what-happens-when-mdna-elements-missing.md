# What Happens When mDNA Elements Are Missing?

## Direct Answer

When movement DNA (mDNA) elements are missing, the system cannot activate. This is the crucial insight about mDNA: it is systemic. Each element is necessary but not sufficient on its own. You can enhance discipleship, but if you don't have APEST culture or organic systems, you won't get movement. You can have all five elements, but if you're missing even one, the system won't activate. This is why churches can be doing many good things—good discipleship, good mission, good community—and still not experience the transformative power of movement.

When elements are missing, you get partial solutions that don't create movement. For example, if you have good discipleship but lack APEST culture, you'll have well-formed individuals but no movemental multiplication. If you have missional passion but lack organic systems, you'll have activity but no reproduction. If you have community but lack communitas, you'll have comfort but no transformative edge. The specific symptoms depend on which elements are missing, but the common result is that the church functions as an organization rather than a movement. The good news is that mDNA is latent in every church—the elements can be recovered and activated. The task is to assess which elements are missing and work intentionally to embed them.

## Expanded Explanation

The systemic nature of mDNA means that all six elements must be present and working together for Apostolic Genius to emerge. When elements are missing, you get:

**Missing "Jesus is Lord"**: Without the central confession, everything else lacks meaning and coherence. The church becomes activity-focused rather than Christ-centered. There's no organizing principle, no foundation.

**Missing "Disciple-Making"**: Without disciple-making as the core practice, you get converts but not disciples. There's no multiplication, no formation, no transformation. The church grows but doesn't reproduce.

**Missing "Missional-Incarnational Impulse"**: Without going out and going deep, the church becomes attractional and extractional. It expects people to come to it rather than going to them. It remains foreign to culture rather than becoming native.

**Missing "APEST Culture"**: Without the fivefold ministry environment, the church operates with truncated functions (typically just Shepherd and Teacher). It lacks the change agents (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) needed for missional engagement and adaptive change.

**Missing "Organic Systems"**: Without movemental structures, the church operates like a machine rather than an organism. It can't reproduce, can't adapt, can't multiply. It maintains but doesn't move.

**Missing "Communitas"**: Without liminal community, the church has comfort but no transformative edge. It lacks the deep togetherness that forms through shared adventure and mission.

The specific symptoms depend on which elements are missing, but the common result is organizational stasis rather than movemental dynamism. The church functions as an institution rather than a movement.

The good news is that mDNA is latent in every church. The elements can be recovered and activated. The task is to assess which elements are missing and work intentionally to embed them.

## Key Points

- **Systemic nature**: All six elements are necessary. Missing even one prevents activation.

- **Partial solutions**: When elements are missing, you get partial solutions that don't create movement.

- **Specific symptoms**: The symptoms depend on which elements are missing.

- **Common result**: Organizational stasis rather than movemental dynamism.

- **Recovery possible**: mDNA is latent. Elements can be recovered and activated.

- **Assessment needed**: Identify which elements are missing and work to embed them.

## Practical Application

Assess which elements are missing. Use the mDNA framework to diagnose your church. Be honest about what's present and what's not.

Work on missing elements. Don't just focus on what's working. Intentionally develop the elements that are missing.

Remember that all six are necessary. You can't pick and choose. All must be present and working together.

Be patient. Recovering missing elements takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort.

## Examples

Churches that are missing APEST culture often have good discipleship and mission but lack the change agents needed for movement. They operate with just Shepherd and Teacher functions, creating stasis.

Churches that are missing organic systems often have passion and vision but can't reproduce. They operate like machines rather than organisms.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"We can focus on just a few elements"**: No, all six are necessary. The system won't activate if any element is missing.

**"Some elements are more important"**: While contexts may require different emphasis, all elements are necessary.

**"Missing elements can't be recovered"**: mDNA is latent. Elements can be recovered and activated.
