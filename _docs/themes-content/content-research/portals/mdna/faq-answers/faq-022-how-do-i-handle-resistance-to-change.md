# How Do I Handle Resistance to Change?

## Direct Answer

To handle resistance to change, recognize that resistance is normal and expected. Change is difficult, and people naturally resist it—especially when they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. The paradigm problem is exacerbated when people are so deeply invested in the current system—receiving salary, status, and kudos—that they cannot, or will not, call it into question. We know from history that resistance to change does not come from the ignorant masses but rather from the "professionals" who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

To handle resistance, engage in metanoia—help people see the need for change through the downcurve of the journey (Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand). Help them face the reality that current paradigms may be limiting capacity. Create liminal experiences that help people see the need for change. Build a coalition of the willing—focus on the 10-16% of innovators and early adopters who are ready for change. Tell alternate stories that help people imagine new possibilities. Let things die—recognize that some things need to end for new things to begin. Be patient and persistent. Recognize that this is not just a human battle but a spiritual one—there are powers and principalities that resist transformation. Pray, discern, and rely on the Holy Spirit.

## Expanded Explanation

Resistance to change is normal and expected. Change is difficult, and people naturally resist it. The paradigm problem is exacerbated when people are deeply invested in the current system. We know from history that resistance often comes from those with vested interests—the "professionals" who receive salary, status, and kudos from the current system.

To handle resistance, you must:

1. **Engage in metanoia**: Help people see the need for change. Take them through the downcurve: Unravel (face problems), Uncover (see system flaws), Unlock (explore possibilities), Understand (gain clarity).

2. **Create liminal experiences**: Put people in threshold situations where they can see the need for change. Liminality strips away false securities and forces reliance on God.

3. **Build a coalition of the willing**: Focus on the 10-16% of innovators and early adopters. According to Diffusion of Innovation theory, you only need 16% for change to be inevitable in a system.

4. **Tell alternate stories**: Help people imagine new possibilities. Stories are more powerful than arguments.

5. **Let things die**: Recognize that some things need to end for new things to begin. Don't try to preserve everything.

6. **Be patient and persistent**: Change takes time. Don't give up.

7. **Recognize spiritual battle**: This is not just a human battle but a spiritual one. Pray, discern, and rely on the Holy Spirit.
