# What Resources Do I Need?

## Direct Answer

The remarkable thing about movement DNA (mDNA) is that it doesn't require special resources. In fact, remarkable movements often had fewer resources, not more. The early church had no buildings, no professional leadership, no formal institutions, no mass meetings, yet they grew from 25,000 to 20 million. The Chinese underground church had no buildings, no central organization, and no mass meetings, yet they grew from 2 million to 120 million. This tells us something profound: the church has everything it needs to get the job done. God has designed his ecclesia to be inherently movemental.

What you need is not external resources but internal activation. You need: prayer and the work of the Holy Spirit, passionate love of God, intentional embedding of mDNA elements, patience and persistence, and a willingness to recover what's been forgotten. The resources are already present in your church—the people, the relationships, the DNA. The task is not to acquire new resources but to activate what's already there. You may find helpful tools like assessment frameworks, books, and training, but these are supplements, not requirements. The core resources—the six elements of mDNA—are already latent in every expression of church, waiting to be recovered and activated.

## Expanded Explanation

mDNA doesn't require special resources because:
- The elements are already present
- The DNA is latent in every church
- Movements often had fewer resources
- The power comes from the system, not external resources

What you need:
- Prayer and the Holy Spirit
- Passionate love of God
- Intentional embedding
- Patience and persistence
- Willingness to recover

Helpful supplements:
- Assessment frameworks
- Books and resources
- Training and coaching

But these are supplements, not requirements. The core resources are already present.

## Key Points

- **No special resources needed**: mDNA doesn't require external resources.

- **Already present**: The elements are latent in every church.

- **Fewer resources often better**: Movements often had fewer resources.

- **Internal activation**: What you need is activation, not acquisition.

- **Supplements helpful**: Tools can help but aren't required.

## Practical Application

Recognize that resources are already present. The task is activation, not acquisition.

Focus on prayer and the Holy Spirit. These are the essential resources.

Be intentional about embedding elements. This doesn't require special resources.

Use helpful supplements if available, but don't let lack of resources be an excuse.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"We need special resources"**: No, mDNA doesn't require special resources.

**"We can't start without resources"**: The resources are already present. The task is activation.
