# Disciplism Framework: Reframing Evangelism Through Discipleship

## Framework Overview

Disciplism is the framework that reframes evangelism within the context of discipleship. It recognizes that the Great Commission is explicitly about making disciples, not just evangelism, and that discipleship should begin before conversion and continue long after. The framework addresses the alarming loss of discipleship as a central practice in the contemporary church, despite it being at the heart of Jesus' Great Commission.

The core insight is that discipleship, worship, and mission are dimensionally different aspects of the same phenomenon. Discipleship is not an optional extra for those who want to go deeper—it is the essential task Jesus focused on, and the recovery of authentic discipleship is essential to addressing the church's current problems.

The framework challenges the prevailing approach that has substituted disciple-making with event-based proclamation and altar calls, fundamentally altering the unavoidable command of the resurrected Lord. It argues that one cannot consume one's way into the kingdom and that the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

Disciplism recognizes that a missional understanding of discipleship is necessary to transform admirers of Jesus into true followers who will go the distance and make a lasting impact. The key to church health and renewal is not more evangelism but more discipleship, and current evangelistic practices may actually block the capacity for disciple-making.

## Component Parts

### The End Game: What Discipleship Is Really About

**Current State**: The contemporary church has reduced discipleship to:
- Introduction to theology and culture of the local church (12-week membership classes)
- Optional spiritual disciplines for those wanting to go deeper
- Church attendance, quiet times, and random voluntarism

**The Problem**: These approaches are inadequate to form people who can impact the world. They lack a clear understanding of what authentic discipleship entails and what the end game of discipleship is truly about.

**The Solution**: Discipleship must be understood as a lifelong process of embodying Jesus' message and mission, beginning before conversion and continuing until the end. It is the process of assimilating the gospel over a whole lifetime, becoming more like Christ and allowing His life to infuse ours.

### A Church Equal to the Game

**Key Insight**: The key to church health and renewal is not more evangelism but more discipleship. Current evangelistic practices may actually block the capacity for disciple-making.

**Historical Evidence**: Drawing from the study of transformative movements throughout history, discipleship is an irreplaceable key to catalytic movements and must be factored in at every level of the organization.

**The Great Commission**: The text explicitly binds believers to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making, not evangelism. While evangelism is implied in the process of disciple-making, discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around.

### Hear O Israel: The Great Commission Revisited

**The Text**: Matthew 28:18-20 explicitly commands making disciples, not just evangelism. The church growth movement built much of its theology on a reductionist interpretation that substituted disciple-making with event-based proclamation and altar calls.

**The Command**: "Go and make disciples of all nations" is the unavoidable command of the resurrected Lord. It cannot be reduced to evangelism alone.

**The Process**: Discipleship should start even before people become regenerated converts and continue right till the end. Evangelism is "done" along the way.

### Make Consumers of All Nations?

**The Problem**: Contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism. Consumptive methods fail to challenge the primary religion of most seekers and actually exacerbate it.

**The Insight**: One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom. The way to salvation in the kingdom of God leads through the cross and through our ongoing willingness to surrender our own agendas.

**The Solution**: The only way to challenge the insidiously idolatrous nature of consumerism is through becoming more and more like Jesus—in other words through discipleship.

**Begin with the End in Mind**: If the Great Commission is about discipleship, then discipleship should always be a major aspect in our thinking and approach to church vitality and mission.

### Reimagining Evangelism Through Discipleship

**The Approach**: Simply follow the Great Commission literally. Go and make disciples of the nations. Just start discipling people everywhere, and the gospel of the kingdom will be shared along the way in a far more natural, personal, loving and life-oriented way.

**Pre-Conversion Discipleship**: Discipleship should start even before people become regenerated converts and continue right till the end. Evangelism is "done" along the way.

**The Engels Scale**: A continuum ranging from -6 to +6 that observes definite stages people undergo in coming to faith and growing in discipleship. This reframing makes space for long-term, authentic, loving relationships.

**Examples**: 
- Soma Communities: Integration of the gospel is a lifelong process. In the pre-conversion stage, emphasis falls on evangelism, but is still seen as part of discipleship. Once someone gives her life to Christ, the emphasis shifts from evangelism to discipleship, but in a real sense she is always being evangelized.
- New Thing Network: Built a movement on the idea that everyone is on a journey back to God, and that the movement's mission is to help make this happen through apprenticeship relationships.

### It's All About Jesus

**The Foundation**: Discipleship is fundamentally about adherence to Jesus as both Lord and Savior. Many of the church's problems stem from divorcing Jesus' work from His person.

**The Process**: Discipleship is the process of assimilating the gospel over a whole lifetime, becoming more like Christ and allowing His life to infuse ours.

**The Warning**: Western Christianity has emphasized salvation theology while diminishing Jesus' words, actions, and radical lifestyle. This is the dangerous heresy of separating Jesus' salvation from His lordship.

**The Conclusion**: A church that takes discipleship seriously is a church that takes Jesus seriously, and that disciple-making lies at the core of the church's mission.

## System Dynamics

Disciplism works as an integrated system:

1. **Discipleship precedes evangelism**: Evangelism happens naturally within the context of discipleship, not the other way around.

2. **Process over event**: Discipleship is a lifelong process, not a one-time event. It begins before conversion and continues until the end.

3. **Embodiment enables transmission**: The capacity to actually integrate and live out the teachings and message of Jesus (embodiment) is critical to the capacity to transfer the message through relationships (transmission).

4. **Cross defines relationship**: The cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning, not as an optional extra.

5. **Jesus is both Lord and Savior**: Discipleship cannot be separated from Jesus' lordship. Salvation and discipleship are integrated, not separate.

6. **Multiplication over addition**: When every follower of Jesus disciples just two or three people, we create exponential, transformative ministry as Jesus intended.

## Activation Principles

Disciplism activates when:

1. **Discipleship is prioritized**: Discipleship is seen as the core mission, not an optional extra.

2. **Process is embraced**: Discipleship is understood as a lifelong process, beginning before conversion and continuing until the end.

3. **Evangelism is reframed**: Evangelism is reframed within the context of discipleship, not the other way around.

4. **Cross is central**: The cross defines our relationship to God from the very beginning.

5. **Jesus is Lord and Savior**: Jesus' lordship and salvation are integrated, not separated.

6. **Multiplication is built in**: Every believer is activated to disciple others, creating exponential growth.

What blocks activation:
- **Event-based evangelism**: Relying on altar calls and one-time decisions rather than lifelong discipleship
- **Consumerism**: Using consumptive methods that fail to challenge the primary religion of most seekers
- **Separation of salvation and discipleship**: Treating discipleship as optional after salvation
- **Professional ministry only**: Limiting disciple-making to professionals rather than activating all believers
- **Lack of process**: Not having a clear pathway for discipleship from beginning to end
- **Ignoring the cross**: Not requiring the cross from the very beginning

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess if Disciplism is present and functioning:

1. **Evaluate discipleship priority**: Is discipleship seen as the core mission, or an optional extra?

2. **Assess process**: Is there a clear pathway for discipleship from beginning to end?

3. **Check evangelism context**: Is evangelism happening within the context of discipleship?

4. **Examine cross centrality**: Does the cross define our relationship to God from the very beginning?

5. **Look for multiplication**: Are all believers activated to disciple others?

6. **Assess Jesus integration**: Are Jesus' lordship and salvation integrated, not separated?

Key questions:
- Is discipleship the core mission, or an optional extra?
- Does discipleship begin before conversion and continue until the end?
- Is evangelism happening within the context of discipleship?
- Does the cross define our relationship to God from the very beginning?
- Are all believers activated to disciple others?
- Are Jesus' lordship and salvation integrated?

## Implementation Pathways

To implement Disciplism in your church or organization:

1. **Reframe evangelism**: Move evangelism from event-based proclamation to lifelong discipleship process.

2. **Begin with the end in mind**: If the Great Commission is about discipleship, make discipleship the core mission.

3. **Start before conversion**: Begin discipling people even before they become regenerated converts.

4. **Require the cross**: Make the cross central from the very beginning, not an optional extra.

5. **Activate all believers**: Enable every believer to disciple others, not just professionals.

6. **Create pathways**: Develop clear pathways for discipleship from beginning to end.

7. **Build multiplication**: Design for exponential growth through disciple-making disciples.

8. **Integrate Jesus**: Ensure Jesus' lordship and salvation are integrated, not separated.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Reframe evangelism within the context of discipleship
- Process: Develop clear pathways from beginning to end
- Activation: Enable all believers to disciple others
- Integration: Ensure Jesus' lordship and salvation are integrated
- Multiplication: Design for exponential growth

## Case Studies and Examples

**Jesus' Ministry**: Jesus had a whole lot of "pre-conversion disciples" tagging along with Him. All the while, He's just discipling them along the way until the gospel narrative finally weaves its way into their hearts and they come alive to God in new birth.

**The Early Church (100-300 A.D.)**: Seekers had to prove their adherence to Jesus and commitments to His Way before they were allowed to actually become part of the Church. Catechumens were thoroughly assessed and put through a rigorous discipleship process by a sponsor. These catechisms could go up to four years before the seeker was allowed to even hear and respond to the gospel, be baptized and join the community.

**Soma Communities (Tacoma, WA)**: Integration of the gospel is a lifelong process. In the pre-conversion stage, emphasis falls on evangelism, but is still seen as part of discipleship. Once someone gives her life to Christ, the emphasis shifts from evangelism to discipleship, but in a real sense she is always being evangelized.

**New Thing Network**: Built a movement on the idea that everyone is on a journey back to God, and that the movement's mission is to help make this happen. They take discipleship very seriously, calling it "apprenticeship" because it carries within it the idea of learning by doing.

**The Jack Example**: A neighbor named Jack is discipled through a process that begins with generic mentoring and moves toward more Christ-centered discipleship. The early stages emphasize evangelistic and invitational aspects, but always within the context of the discipleship journey.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Event-based evangelism**: Relying on altar calls and one-time decisions rather than lifelong discipleship.

2. **Consumerism**: Using consumptive methods that fail to challenge the primary religion of most seekers.

3. **Separation of salvation and discipleship**: Treating discipleship as optional after salvation.

4. **Professional ministry only**: Limiting disciple-making to professionals rather than activating all believers.

5. **Lack of process**: Not having a clear pathway for discipleship from beginning to end.

6. **Ignoring the cross**: Not requiring the cross from the very beginning.

7. **Formulaic approaches**: Using one-size-fits-all methods rather than contextual engagement.

8. **Rush to conversion**: Trying to get people to pray specific prayers rather than allowing the process to unfold naturally.

## Evolution and Development

The Disciplism Framework has evolved through:

**Early Development**: First introduced in *Disciplism* (2011) as a comprehensive framework for reframing evangelism within the context of discipleship.

**Integration**: The framework has been integrated with:
- mDNA System (discipleship as one of the six elements)
- The Great Commission (as the explicit command)
- Missional-Incarnational Impulse (as the way discipleship happens in context)

The understanding continues to develop as the framework is applied in diverse contexts and as connections to other frameworks are explored.
