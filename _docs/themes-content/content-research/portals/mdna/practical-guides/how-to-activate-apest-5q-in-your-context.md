# How to Activate APEST/5Q in Your Context

## Getting Started

### Where to Begin

APEST (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) represents the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11, where Christ gives gifts to his church. In 5Q, this framework is expanded and deepened, revealing APEST not merely as ministry functions but as five forms of intelligence (5Q) that are both the primordial template for church life and universal archetypes present throughout human culture.

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. The "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents, while "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. Both are needed in dynamic tension.

Activating APEST/5Q is about recovering the full intelligence of the Body of Christ—not just for leaders, but for every believer. Every member of the Body has a vital role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world.

### Prerequisites and Readiness Assessment

Before you begin activating APEST/5Q, assess your readiness:

**Key questions to ask:**

- Are you willing to move beyond the clergy-laity divide?
- Will you recognize that every believer carries elements of all five functions?
- Are you open to discovering that your current leadership structure might be incomplete?
- Do you have a core team willing to explore their own APEST profiles?
- Are you ready to restructure how you think about ministry and leadership?

**What you need before starting:**

1. **Understanding of the framework**—At least key leaders should understand what APEST/5Q is and why it matters
2. **Willingness to assess honestly**—Be ready to discover gaps in your current ministry mix
3. **Commitment to the process**—This isn't a quick fix but a fundamental reorientation
4. **Openness to change**—You may need to restructure leadership, ministry, and organizational culture

### Initial Preparation Steps

1. **Read foundational texts**—*The Permanent Revolution* and *5Q* provide comprehensive treatment of the framework
2. **Take APEST profiles**—Have key leaders take the online APEST test at www.apest.org or www.5qcentral.com
3. **Assess your current mix**—What APEST functions are present? Which are missing?
4. **Gather a core team**—Form a group committed to exploring and activating fivefold ministry
5. **Pray together**—Ask God to reveal the gifts he has given to your community

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Discover Your APEST Profile (Weeks 1-4)

The journey begins with self-discovery. Each person needs to understand their own APEST profile.

**What to do:**

- **Take the online APEST test**—The most statistically reliable method is at www.apest.org (also accessible via www.5qcentral.com)
- **Create a Personal APEST Portrait**—Rank your APEST functions in descending order, placing your primary gifting in the largest circle
- **Reflect on life events**—What experiences in your life connect to your profile?
- **Journal your insights**—Write down what you're discovering about yourself
- **Share with others**—In a group setting, share your portrait and receive feedback

**The Personal APEST Portrait process:**

1. Before gathering, each person should:
   - Reflect personally on their APEST giftings (Ephesians 4:7)
   - Identify their primary (dominant) and secondary calling
   - Fill out the diagram with primary in largest circle, secondary in next largest, etc.
   - Take the online test to confirm or refine impressions
   - Journal insights to share

2. When gathering as a group:
   - Allow 30 minutes for each person to share their portrait, feelings, and rationale
   - Leader should model this first
   - Group gives honest, loving feedback: Is the portrait accurate?
   - Adjust as appropriate
   - Pray for and affirm each person's calling

**How to know when to move forward:** When each person has a clear understanding of their APEST profile and the group has confirmed or refined these portraits together.

### Step 2: Assess Your Community's APEST Mix (Weeks 4-8)

Once individuals understand their profiles, assess what's present (and missing) in your community.

**What to do:**

- **Map the gifts**—Create a visual representation of all APEST profiles in your leadership team and community
   - Use Excel charts or similar tools to graph results
   - Identify strengths and gaps
   - Look for patterns and imbalances

- **Conduct an APEST Inventory**—Assess your church's activities and functions through the fivefold lens:
   - What activities reflect apostolic intelligence?
   - What reflects prophetic intelligence?
   - What reflects evangelistic intelligence?
   - What reflects shepherding intelligence?
   - What reflects teaching intelligence?

- **Identify gaps**—Which APEST functions are weak or missing?
  - Are you heavy on ST (Shepherd/Teacher) and light on APE (Apostle/Prophet/Evangelist)?
  - What impact does this imbalance have?
  - What would need to change for all five to function?

- **Reflect as a community**—Host a retreat or extended meeting to:
   - Review strengths and areas for growth
   - Confirm one another's giftings
   - Pray for one another's development
   - Brainstorm how to structure around APEST

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have a clear picture of your community's APEST mix, have identified gaps, and understand the implications of your current balance (or imbalance).

### Step 3: Create APEST Culture (Months 2-4)

APEST isn't just about identifying gifts—it's about creating a culture where all five functions can flourish.

**What to do:**

- **Organize community around APEST**—Structure your leadership and ministry to reflect fivefold intelligence:
  - Ensure all five functions are represented in leadership
  - Create space for each function to operate
  - Custom-build a system that suits your context

- **Develop APEST language**—Help your community understand and use fivefold language:
  - Teach what each function is and does
  - Use APEST language in conversations
  - Celebrate different giftings
  - Help people see how all five work together

- **Create environments for each function:**
  - **Apostolic:** Space for pioneering, multiplication, new initiatives
  - **Prophetic:** Space for truth-telling, challenging, calling to faithfulness
  - **Evangelistic:** Space for sharing faith, connecting with outsiders, recruiting
  - **Shepherding:** Space for caring, nurturing, building community
  - **Teaching:** Space for learning, understanding, grounding in truth

- **Use APEST Thinking Hats**—Teach teams to approach problems through each APEST lens:
  1. Define a team problem
  2. Work through five thinking hats (A, P, E, S, T)
  3. Each member thinks from each perspective
  4. Explore solutions from all five angles
  - This removes defensiveness and ensures all perspectives are heard

**How to know when to move forward:** When your community understands APEST, uses the language, and you're beginning to see all five functions operating.

### Step 4: Develop Ministry Capacity (Months 4-8)

Activating APEST means developing people's capacity to function in their giftings and grow in other areas.

**What to do:**

- **Train people in their giftings:**
  - Provide resources and training for each APEST function
  - Create learning communities around each function
  - Connect people with mentors who exemplify their gifting
  - Encourage people to develop their primary gifting

- **Encourage growth beyond base:**
  - Help people understand their "base" (primary gifting) and "phases" (other roles they've operated in)
  - Encourage everyone to grow beyond their base for well-rounded maturity
  - Create opportunities for people to function in different APEST roles
  - Recognize that circumstances often guide which phase we enter

- **Use action-reflection education:**
  - Engage in ministry activity
  - Provide process for reflection and goal setting
  - Establish theological and missiological frameworks
  - Create in-house internship processes

- **Provide resources:**
  - Books, DVDs, articles for each APEST function
  - Conferences and workshops
  - Connection to networks and learning communities
  - Formal training when appropriate

**How to know when to move forward:** When people are being trained in their giftings, growing beyond their base, and you're seeing increased ministry capacity across all five functions.

### Step 5: Structure Around APEST (Months 6-12)

For APEST to function well, your organizational structure needs to support it.

**What to do:**

- **Restructure leadership:**
  - Ensure all five functions are represented in leadership
  - Move from single-leader models to team-based leadership
  - Create roles and responsibilities that reflect APEST functions
  - Balance change agents (APE) with stability providers (ST)

- **Reorganize ministry:**
  - Structure ministry around APEST rather than programs
  - Create teams that reflect fivefold intelligence
  - Ensure all five functions have expression in your ministry
  - Balance missional (APE) and maintenance (ST) activities

- **Develop APEST pathways:**
  - Create discipleship pathways that develop all five intelligences
  - Design leadership development around APEST
  - Structure training to develop each function
  - Ensure people can grow in their gifting

- **Custom-build your system:**
  - There's no one-size-fits-all approach
  - Adapt APEST to your context
  - Learn from others but create what works for you
  - Be willing to experiment and adjust

**Example: South Melbourne Restoration Community** reconceived itself around APEST ministries, creating structures that allowed all five functions to flourish.

**How to know when to move forward:** When your structure supports APEST, all five functions have expression, and people can grow in their giftings.

### Step 6: Embed APEST in Everything (Ongoing)

APEST should become the lens through which you see everything—not just an add-on program.

**What to do:**

- **Use APEST as diagnostic tool:**
  - Assess organizational health through fivefold lens
  - Identify what's missing or weak
  - Understand why certain problems persist
  - Develop strategies based on APEST analysis

- **Apply APEST to all decisions:**
  - How would an apostle approach this?
  - What would a prophet say?
  - How would an evangelist engage?
  - What would a shepherd consider?
  - What would a teacher need to understand?

- **Develop APEST marks:**
  - Use fivefold functions as marks of a true church:
    - **Apostolic:** Missional impact
    - **Prophetic:** Covenant faithfulness
    - **Evangelistic:** Gospel proclamation
    - **Shepherding:** Reconciled community
    - **Teaching:** Deep wisdom
  - Assess your church against these marks
  - Develop strategies to strengthen each mark

- **Create ongoing development:**
  - Regular APEST assessments
  - Ongoing training and development
  - Continuous refinement of structure
  - Celebration of fivefold diversity

**How to know you're on track:** When APEST is integrated into how you think, structure, and operate, not just something you talk about.

## Common Scenarios

### Small Church Implementation

**Adaptations for small contexts:**
- You may not have all five functions strongly represented—that's okay
- Focus on developing what you have and identifying what's missing
- Partner with other churches or networks to access missing functions
- Use APEST as a lens for understanding your community, not a rigid structure

**Leveraging small size:**
- Small churches can move faster in restructuring
- Easier to ensure all five functions are represented in leadership
- Can create more flexible structures
- Relationships enable better discernment of giftings

### Large Church Implementation

**Adaptations for large contexts:**
- You likely have all five functions present—the challenge is activating them
- Create multiple leadership teams that reflect APEST
- Develop specialized ministries around each function
- Use your resources to provide comprehensive training

**Scaling principles:**
- Embed APEST at every level—not just top leadership
- Create APEST pathways for development
- Structure departments or ministries around fivefold intelligence
- Ensure all five functions have expression in your systems

### New Church Plant Implementation

**Advantages:**
- Can build APEST into your DNA from the start
- No need to restructure existing systems
- Can select initial team to reflect fivefold balance
- Can create structures that support APEST from day one

**What to do:**
- Ensure your core team reflects APEST diversity
- Build fivefold language and culture from the beginning
- Structure around APEST from the start
- Create multiplication ethos that includes all five functions

### Established Church Transformation

**Challenges:**
- Existing structures may resist fivefold framework
- Current leadership may not reflect APEST balance
- People may be comfortable with current models
- Institutional patterns may need to change

**Strategies:**
- Start with assessment—help people see what's missing
- Begin with a pilot group or ministry area
- Gradually restructure rather than forcing immediate change
- Provide education and support throughout transition
- Celebrate diversity and help people see value in all five functions

**Managing resistance:**
- Help people understand why APEST matters
- Show how it's biblical and beneficial
- Address fears about change
- Provide support and training
- Move at a pace people can handle

## Troubleshooting

### What to Do When Things Go Wrong

**Common obstacles and solutions:**

1. **"We don't have all five functions"**
   - **Solution:** That's normal, especially at first. Focus on developing what you have, identify what's missing, and consider how to access missing functions through partnerships or development.

2. **"People don't understand APEST"**
   - **Solution:** Go back to basics. Use stories and examples. Take time to educate. Use the Personal APEST Portrait process. Be patient—this is a paradigm shift.

3. **"Our structure doesn't support APEST"**
   - **Solution:** You may need to restructure. Start small—create APEST teams alongside existing structures. Gradually transition. Get help if needed.

4. **"We're too heavy on ST, light on APE"**
   - **Solution:** This is common. Intentionally develop APE functions. Create space for them. Value them. Train people in these areas. Consider bringing in people with these giftings.

5. **"People are resistant to change"**
   - **Solution:** Help them understand the "why." Show how APEST benefits everyone. Address fears. Move slowly. Provide support. Celebrate small wins.

### How to Address Resistance

**Types of resistance:**

- **Theological resistance**—"Apostles and prophets don't exist anymore"
  - Provide biblical teaching on Ephesians 4
  - Show how these functions are needed today
  - Address misconceptions

- **Practical resistance**—"This is too complicated"
  - Simplify. Start with basics.
  - Use tools like APEST Thinking Hats
  - Show practical benefits

- **Personal resistance**—"I don't want to change my role"
  - Help people see their gifting as valuable
  - Show how APEST honors all functions
  - Provide support for transition

- **Institutional resistance**—"Our structure doesn't allow this"
  - Create parallel structures
  - Gradually transition
  - Show how APEST improves effectiveness

### Course Correction Strategies

**When to pause and reassess:**

- If people are confused or frustrated
- If you're not seeing progress after 6+ months
- If there's significant conflict
- If key leaders are resistant

**How to course correct:**

1. **Stop and assess**—What's working? What's not?
2. **Get feedback**—Ask people what they're experiencing
3. **Simplify**—Maybe you're trying to do too much
4. **Adjust approach**—Try different tools or methods
5. **Get help**—Consult with others further along
6. **Renew commitment**—Remember why this matters
