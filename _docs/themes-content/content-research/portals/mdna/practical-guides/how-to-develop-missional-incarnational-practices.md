# How to Develop Missional-Incarnational Practices

## Getting Started

### Where to Begin

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ.

The missional impulse refers to the outward thrust—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us. The incarnational impulse refers to deep identification with culture—becoming native to our context rather than remaining foreign. Together, they enable the church to seed and embed the gospel in every context.

If you're reading this, you've likely recognized that your church needs to move beyond attractional approaches ("come to us") toward missional engagement ("go to them"). You've probably felt the frustration of programs that don't reach people or events that don't transform lives. Developing missional-incarnational practices is about moving from theory to practice, from programs to a way of life.

### Prerequisites and Readiness Assessment

Before you begin developing missional-incarnational practices, assess your readiness:

**Key questions to ask:**

- Are you willing to move beyond "come to us" approaches?
- Will you commit to going to people rather than expecting them to come to you?
- Are you ready to identify deeply with your context and culture?
- Do you have people willing to take risks and step out?
- Are you prepared for this to become a way of life, not just a program?

**What you need before starting:**

1. **Understanding of the framework**—Know what missional and incarnational mean
2. **Commitment to proximity**—Willingness to be physically and relationally close to those you're reaching
3. **Time and space**—You'll need to free up time for mission
4. **A core group**—People committed to developing these practices together
5. **Cultural awareness**—Understanding that all mission is now cross-cultural

### Initial Preparation Steps

1. **Read foundational texts**—*Fast Forward to Mission*, *Right Here, Right Now*, and *The Forgotten Ways* provide comprehensive frameworks
2. **Assess your current practices**—What are you doing that's attractional? What's missional?
3. **Identify your context**—Who are you called to reach? Where are they?
4. **Gather a core team**—Form a group committed to developing missional practices
5. **Pray together**—Ask God to show you where he's already at work

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Move Out—Into Missional Engagement (Months 1-3)

The first movement is simply the willingness to go—to move out into missional engagement.

**What to do:**

- **Understand the mission has a church**—It's not that the church has a mission, but that the mission has a church. We are the result of God's missionary activity. God sends, and we are sent.

- **Recognize every Christian is a missionary**—You are the church before you do church. Because the Holy Spirit lives in us, we are all agents of the King right here, right now, at any time and in any place.

- **Start with what's in your hand**—It's not about starting grand programs. It's doing what you do... for God. The basic elements of missionality are already present in your life.

- **Learn the art of the small**—Focus on smaller areas where your efforts will be felt more fully. Find the pressure point that will cause everything else to change.

- **Build a bridge and get over it**—As my wife Deb says, "After all is said and done, it's all about learning to love other people as Jesus did, isn't it?"

**Practical first steps:**

- **Identify where people are**—Where do the people you're called to reach gather? Where do they find community?
- **Go there**—Start spending time in those places. Become a regular.
- **Use what you love**—Make a list of things you love to do. Find people who do those things together.
- **Start small**—Don't try to do everything. Pick one place or one group of people.

**How to know when to move forward:** When you're regularly going to people rather than expecting them to come to you, and you're beginning to develop relationships in those contexts.

### Step 2: Move In—Burrowing into Culture (Months 3-6)

Moving out leads naturally to moving in—burrowing deep into culture through incarnation.

**What to do:**

- **Go tribal**—Choose to connect with, identify with, and belong to specific subcultural groups. Don't try to identify with everyone—focus on meaningful connections with certain people and people groups.

- **Take culture seriously**—In Western contexts, all communication of the gospel is now cross-cultural. You simply have to assume this. Don't presume you really know what's going on.

- **Develop cultural savvy**—Go to movies with them, read what they read, hang out where they hang out. Learn their language, understand their stories, engage their culture.

- **Practice the six P's of incarnation:**
  - **Presence**—Full identification with culture, being God in the flesh in that context
  - **Proximity**—Geographic and relational closeness
  - **Powerlessness**—Humility and vulnerability, servanthood
  - **Provenience**—Recognizing God's work already present
  - **Passion**—Embracing redemptive suffering
  - **Proclamation**—Sharing the good news

- **Redeem your hangout**—Make a list of things you love to do. Find vibrant social spaces in your area and adopt one, becoming a regular.

**Practical steps:**

- **Move into the neighborhood**—If possible, relocate to be in proximity with those you're reaching
- **Adopt a third place**—Identify a local watering hole (pub, café, park) and hang out there regularly
- **Join existing groups**—Rather than starting your own, join groups that already exist
- **Learn the lingo**—Understand and adopt the language forms of the people you love and serve
- **Follow the ant trails**—Where do they meet? Why do they meet? Follow the social patterns

**How to know when to move forward:** When you're developing deep relationships, understanding the culture, and beginning to see what "good news" means in that context.

### Step 3: Move Alongside—Engaging in Relationships (Months 6-9)

Moving alongside involves developing genuine friendships and relational networks.

**What to do:**

- **Develop proximity, frequency, and spontaneity:**
  - **Proximity:** Physical closeness with those you're reaching
  - **Frequency:** Regularity of connection that builds familiarity
  - **Spontaneity:** Flexible environment for unplanned connections

- **Go beyond functional friendships**—The Great Commission is a discipling text, not just an evangelistic one. Commit to long-term relationships that include meaningful friendships, genuine involvement, and compassionate concern.

- **Practice the art of conversation**—Be culturally interesting. Use conversation to invite friendship, provoke intrigue, promote mutual quest, weave story with opinion, extend a listening ear, and offer something of yourself.

- **Practice hospitality**—If every Christian family simply offered good conversational hospitality around a table once a week to neighbors, we would eat our way into the kingdom of God.

- **Sneeze the gospel**—Let the gospel travel along relational lines. The greater your social surface (rich relationships), the higher the likelihood of influence and missional impact.

**Practical steps:**

- **Shop at the same places**—Commit to supporting local shopkeepers. Develop familiarity with staff and other customers.
- **Spend time at the school fence**—When picking up children, spend extra time chatting with other parents.
- **Invite people into your life**—BBQs, parties, picnics, Sunday lunch at a café. Do this biweekly with a reasonably small group.
- **Go out for lunch or coffee**—With work colleagues once a week. Conversation becomes different outside the work context.
- **Find people of peace**—Look for influential members of the community who are spiritually open and can introduce you to others.

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have developed meaningful relationships, people are inviting you into their lives, and you're becoming part of their social networks.

### Step 4: Move From—Challenging Dehumanizing Aspects (Months 9-12)

Sometimes you need to issue direct challenges to aspects of culture that are ungodly and dehumanizing.

**What to do:**

- **Discern what to challenge**—The gospel doesn't challenge everything in culture. There are many good things consistent with biblical understanding (common grace). But there will be things that jar against what Jesus teaches.

- **Question and quest**—You don't always have to take issues head-on. Sometimes your role is to be undercover subversives. Use questions and parables to provoke a search.

- **Live counter-culturally**—The most consistent way to challenge destructive forces is to live contrary to them:
  - In a world obsessed with consumerism, choose simplicity
  - In a world obsessed with status, associate with poor and "invisible" people
  - In a world obsessed with money, choose generosity

- **Embody alternative in community**—The church doesn't have a social strategy; the church is the social strategy. Show the world a type of life it can never achieve through social coercion.

**Practical steps:**

- **Examine your lifestyle**—What aspects of your life challenge the culture? What needs to change?
- **Create counter-cultural community**—How does your community embody alternatives to destructive cultural patterns?
- **Address specific issues**—Money, power, sexuality—how do you model alternatives?
- **Use questions and stories**—Rather than direct confrontation, use questions and parables to provoke thinking

**How to know when to move forward:** When you're living counter-culturally, your community embodies alternatives, and you're engaging culture with both love and challenge.

### Step 5: Develop Proximity, Frequency, and Spontaneity (Ongoing)

These three practices are essential for sustaining missional engagement.

**Proximity practices:**

- **Move into the neighborhood**—Live in close proximity to those you wish to connect with
- **Discover where locals gather**—Locate your mission group within these social hubs
- **Hold planning meetings in third places**—Meet in local cafés or pubs rather than meeting rooms
- **Walk your dog regularly**—Develop relationships with other dog owners
- **Read or work in public spaces**—Do your work in cafés, libraries, or other third places
- **Join community groups**—Book clubs, sports groups, fitness classes, parents groups

**Frequency practices:**

- **Adopt a local watering hole**—Identify a place and hang out there regularly
- **Shop at the same places**—Commit to supporting local businesses, develop familiarity
- **Spend time at the school fence**—Regular connection with other parents
- **Invite people regularly**—Biweekly meals or social times with a small group
- **Go out with work colleagues**—Weekly lunch or coffee outside work context

**Spontaneity practices:**

- **Implant flexibility**—Create openness to spontaneity in your mission group
- **Make room for people**—Evaluate how you spend time, reorder life to include spontaneity
- **Free up weekends**—Keep spare time for socializing on Saturday and Sunday
- **Streamline organization**—Limit time and energy needed to keep the machine running
- **Simplify gatherings**—Minimize time and energy of church members
- **Limit in-house gatherings**—Some groups meet 3-4 times per month to release time for mission

**How to know you're on track:** When proximity, frequency, and spontaneity are integrated into the natural rhythms of everyday life, not compartmentalized as "mission time."

### Step 6: Develop Going Deep Practices (Ongoing)

Going deep involves meaningful engagement, proclamation, holy living, hospitality, contextualizing community, and sending.

**Meaningful engagement:**

- **Allow natural relationship development**—Genuine relationships require time and commitment
- **Engage in culture**—Read books not by Christian authors, go to movies, read newspapers, engage current affairs
- **Participate in rites of passage**—Weddings, funerals, birthdays provide profound contexts for connection
- **Recover the art of conversation**—Learn from Jesus' interactions, develop listening and interpersonal skills
- **Be intentional beyond social moments**—Follow up with people, make phone calls, send encouraging messages
- **Build relational networks**—Create a network of significant friendships throughout the host community
- **Spend majority of time with a few**—Most of us can build significant relationships with just a handful of people
- **Share projects**—Work on useful endeavors shoulder to shoulder with those in the host community

**Proclamation:**

- **Be prepared to share**—Always ready to share the gospel story
- **Use natural evangelism framework:**
  - Excite curiosity through storytelling
  - Provoke sense of wonder and awe
  - Be extraordinarily loving
  - Explore how God has touched their lives
  - Focus on Jesus
- **Begin with assumption God is at work**—Ask questions like "Have you had spiritual experiences?" or "When have you felt close to God?"
- **Build on what people know**—Explore gospel stories together, share your own story

**Holy living:**

- **Let your light shine**—Live such good lives that people see your good deeds and glorify God
- **Redeem everyday life**—Begin to redeem everyday life, its experiences and pleasures, as gifts from God
- **Embody Jesus' holiness**—Look to Jesus as the best reference point for holy living
- **Live life and socialize with people**—Regardless of race, lifestyle, gender, or religion

**Hospitality:**

- **Shared meals**—Eat regularly with those in your host community
- **Share your table with the poor**—If every Christian family had a poor person over once a week, we would transform the world
- **Recover the art of partying**—Host the best parties where people really celebrate and enjoy life
- **Create environments of belonging**—Where people experience the character of God, feel belonging before believing, and can explore spirituality with freedom

**Contextualizing community:**

- **Build church around people in their context**—Church flows out of mission and should be expressed within its cultural environment
- **Listen to the people**—Develop increased attentiveness to issues related to the given culture
- **Spend more time listening, eating, playing**—Work toward not merely identifying with locals but becoming one
- **Critically examine culture together**—What values promote the gospel? What obstructs it?
- **Experiment with new symbols and rituals**—Explore the host community's history and culture to find practices that enrich the collective experience

**Sending:**

- **Continue to send**—Send small groups from within your community to seed and embed the gospel in new contexts
- **Remember reproductive capacity**—Each unit of church can be understood as a pod filled with seeds, pregnant with other churches
- **Continue to move out and down**—The missional-incarnational impulse must be embedded deep within the missional community

**How to know you're on track:** When you're developing deep relationships, sharing faith naturally, living holy lives, practicing hospitality, contextualizing community, and continuing to send.

- Use your small size to be more flexible
- Don't feel you need all the resources

**Advantages:**
- Easier to develop communitas
- Can move faster
- More relational flexibility
- Less institutional inertia

**Examples:**
- Third Place Communities—Small group meeting in a pub
- The Joshua Tree—Small group gathering at the beach for breakfast
- Many small churches find their size helps them be more missional

### Large Church Implementation

**Adaptations:**
- Start with pilot groups or ministry areas
- Create missional communities within larger structure
- Use resources to provide training and support
- Be patient—change takes longer in large organizations

**Strategies:**

- Develop missional communities
- Provide training and resources
- Support multiple action groups

### Urban Context Implementation

**Specific considerations:**
- **Cultural diversity**—Multiple subcultures and tribes
- **Third places**—Pubs, cafés, parks, community centers
- **Proximity challenges**—May need to relocate or commit significant time
- **Cross-cultural complexity**—All mission is cross-cultural

**What to do:**
- Identify specific urban tribes
- Choose one or a few to focus on
- Develop deep cultural understanding
- Commit to proximity and frequency

### Suburban Context Implementation

**Specific considerations:**
- **Geographic spread**—People may be more dispersed
- **Third places**—May be different (schools, sports, community centers)
- **Family focus**—Many suburban contexts are family-oriented
- **Safety and comfort**—May need to challenge comfort zones

**What to do:**
- Focus on schools, sports, and family activities
- Develop relationships through children's activities
- Create third places if they don't exist
- Challenge suburban comfort and safety

### Rural Context Implementation

**Specific considerations:**
- **Smaller population**—Fewer people, closer relationships
- **Different third places**—May be community centers, local businesses
- **Slower pace**—Can develop deeper relationships
- **Tight-knit communities**—May be harder to break into

**What to do:**
- Leverage smaller size for deeper relationships
- Support local businesses and community
- Participate in community events
- Be patient—relationships take time in tight-knit communities

## Troubleshooting

### What to Do When Things Go Wrong

**Common obstacles:**

1. **"We're too busy"**
   - **Solution:** Simplify your church life. Limit in-house gatherings. Free up time. Nothing can be loved at speed.

2. **"People aren't interested"**
   - **Solution:** Are you asking "What is good news for this people?" Are you engaging their culture? Are you building relationships first?

3. **"We don't know where to start"**
   - **Solution:** Start with what's in your hand. What do you love? Where do you already spend time? Who are you already in relationship with?

4. **"We tried it and nothing happened"**
   - **Solution:** How long did you try? Relationships take time. Are you practicing proximity, frequency, and spontaneity? Are you being patient?

5. **"We're not seeing results"**
   - **Solution:** What are you measuring? Relationships? Cultural engagement? Or just conversions? Adjust your expectations. Celebrate small wins.

### How to Address Resistance

**Types of resistance:**

- **Fear of the unknown**—"We don't know these people"
  - Start with what you know
  - Go with others
  - Take small steps
  - Provide support

- **Comfort zone**—"This is uncomfortable"
  - Acknowledge discomfort
  - Move slowly
  - Celebrate courage
  - Provide encouragement

- **Time constraints**—"We don't have time"
  - Simplify church life
  - Integrate mission into life
  - Free up time
  - Make mission a priority

- **Lack of understanding**—"We don't get it"
  - Provide education
  - Use stories and examples
  - Be patient
  - Answer questions

### Course Correction Strategies

**When to pause and reassess:**

- If you've been trying for 6+ months with no relationships
- If people are burned out
- If you're not seeing any engagement
- If there's significant resistance

**How to course correct:**

1. **Stop and assess**—What's working? What's not?
2. **Get feedback**—Ask people what they're experiencing
3. **Simplify**—Maybe you're trying to do too much
4. **Adjust approach**—Try different practices or contexts
5. **Renew commitment**—Remember why this matters
