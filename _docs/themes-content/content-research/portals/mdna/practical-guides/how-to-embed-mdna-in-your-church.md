# How to Embed mDNA in Your Church

## Getting Started

### Where to Begin

Embedding movement DNA (mDNA) into your church is not about adding new programs or activities—it's about awakening something that already lies dormant within every authentic expression of the people of God. The good news? Apostolic Genius is not something new to be created but something latent to be recovered. It's encoded in the very being of the church, a gift from God that has been forgotten but not lost.

If you're reading this, you've likely already felt that "splinter in your mind"—that sense that something is wrong with the way we're doing church, even if you can't quite name it. That feeling is often the first sign that Apostolic Genius is stirring within you. You're not alone. Many who read *The Forgotten Ways* report feeling like they're "remembering" something they had somehow forgotten.

### Prerequisites and Readiness Assessment

Before you begin this journey, it's important to assess your readiness. This isn't a quick fix or a program you can implement in a few months. Embedding mDNA requires a paradigmatic shift—a fundamental change in how you think about church, mission, and the people of God.

**Key questions to ask yourself and your leadership team:**

- Are you willing to relinquish the security of old thinking and adopt "soft eyes" to see what God is already doing?
- Will you courageously change, not just personally but communally and organizationally?
- Are you willing to pay the price to "learn again" and unlearn patterns that have become comfortable but ineffective?
- Do you have a core group of leaders who are committed to this journey, not just interested in it?
- Is your church willing to face the reality that significant change will take time—often years, not months?

**What you need before starting:**

1. **At least one person (preferably more) who has thoroughly read *The Forgotten Ways***—perhaps even twice. This person should be able to act as an informed guide along the journey.
2. **A core team committed to the process**—people who are willing to explore, evaluate, and employ these concepts together.
3. **Realistic expectations**—understanding that this is a long-term journey, not a quick solution.
4. **A willingness to think systemically**—recognizing that mDNA is a system of six interconnected elements, not isolated practices.

### Initial Preparation Steps

1. **Gather your core team**—Start with a small group of committed leaders (5-10 people) who will journey together.
2. **Read *The Forgotten Ways* together**—If possible, have everyone read it. At minimum, ensure your key leaders have read and understood it.
3. **Take the missional fitness test**—Visit www.theforgottenways.org and take the online assessment to identify your current strengths and weaknesses in mDNA.
4. **Pray together**—This is fundamentally a spiritual process. Begin with prayer, asking God to awaken Apostolic Genius in your midst.
5. **Create space for exploration**—Set aside regular time (weekly or bi-weekly) for your team to process what you're learning.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Assess Your Current State (Months 1-2)

The first step is to honestly assess where you are. You can't get where you're going if you don't know where you are.

**What to do:**

- **Take the missional fitness test** as a leadership team and as a church. This will give you a baseline measurement of how present each mDNA element is in your context.
- **Conduct a force-field analysis**—Identify what's helping you move toward movement (boosters) and what's hindering you (blockers) for each mDNA element.
- **Name your wicked problem**—What is the specific challenge or crisis that's driving you to seek change? Be honest about the threats and opportunities you're facing.
- **Map your current practices**—What are you already doing that aligns with mDNA? What are you doing that works against it?

**How to know when to move to the next step:** When you have a clear picture of your current state, have identified your weakest mDNA element, and have named the specific challenges you're facing.

### Step 2: Choose Your Strategic Point of Departure (Month 2-3)

You cannot work on all six elements of mDNA simultaneously. The key is to identify your weakest element and make that your strategic focus.

**What to do:**

- **Review your assessment results**—Which mDNA element scored lowest? That becomes your starting point.
- **Understand why it's weak**—What in your current system is blocking this element? What would need to change for it to flourish?
- **Develop a strategic plan**—Create a focused plan for developing this weakest element over the next 6-12 months.
- **Communicate the vision**—Help your church understand why you're focusing on this particular element and how it connects to the bigger picture.

**The strategic approach:** Once you've developed the weakest element, you identify the next-weakest element and focus on that. This iterative process ensures steady progress while maintaining systemic awareness.

### Step 3: Embed mDNA at the Core (Months 3-6)

If you're a new church planter, you have the advantage of laying down the movemental approach from the start. If you're an established church, you'll need to work harder to disembed inherited patterns.

**What to do:**

- **Work with your core team**—Ensure each member of your core team grapples with the ideas of Apostolic Genius. Much depends on what you build into the "stem cells" of the church.
- **Develop common missional practices**—Create a set of agreed-upon practical commitments that guide your group in living out their identity and values. These practices move values from preferred to actual.
- **Think systems, not programs**—Remember that mDNA is a system. Keep your eye on the whole while focusing on specific elements. Never lose sight that all six elements are needed.
- **Create an action group**—Form a group committed to exploring, evaluating, and employing these concepts. This should be an "action group," not just a discussion group.

**How to know when to move forward:** When your core team understands mDNA, you've developed initial practices, and you're seeing some early signs of change in your weakest element.

### Step 4: Develop Habits and Practices (Months 6-12)

The key distinction here is between core values and core practices. Values on paper don't change behavior. Practices do.

**What to do:**

- **For each mDNA element, develop specific habits and practices:**
  - **Jesus is Lord:** Get over dualism, make the Gospels your primary text, shape everything on Jesus
  - **Disciple-Making:** Raise the bar on discipleship, develop disciple-making practices, activate the priesthood of all believers
  - **Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Develop proximity, frequency, and spontaneity; go out and go deep
  - **APEST Culture:** Discover and activate fivefold functions, create APEST culture
  - **Organic Systems:** Structure organically, network extensively, "sneeze the gospel"
  - **Communitas:** Develop transformative vision, engage in shared endeavors, put adventure back into the venture

- **Use the Explore-Evaluate-Employ process:**
  - **Session 1: Explore**—Talk about it, share initial responses and feelings
  - **Session 2: Evaluate**—Reflect deeper, identify blockages and resistance
  - **Session 3: Employ**—Move into action, brainstorm options and action steps
  - **Session 4: Personal Journal**—Pray, listen, respond to God

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have developed practices for each mDNA element and are beginning to see them integrated into your common life.

### Step 5: Create Real-Life Action Heroes (Months 12-18)

This is critical: you must ensure that people are actually attempting to do what is being discussed. The real heroes should not be those who can master the information intellectually, but those who are willing to give things a go and risk failure.

**What to do:**

- **Inspire a culture of experimentation**—Create permission to dream and try new things. Failure is only failure if you don't learn from it.
- **Celebrate risk-takers**—Honor those who are willing to step out, even if they don't succeed perfectly.
- **Share stories**—Regularly retell stories of missional engagement, both successes and learning experiences.
- **Provide coaching and support**—Don't leave people to figure it out alone. Create structures for encouragement and accountability.

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have a growing number of people actively engaging in missional practices and taking risks for the sake of mission.

### Step 6: Monitor, Adjust, and Deepen (Ongoing)

Embedding mDNA is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. You'll need to regularly assess, adjust, and deepen your engagement.

**What to do:**

- **Regularly reassess**—Take the missional fitness test every 6-12 months to track progress.
- **Identify the next-weakest element**—Once you've strengthened one element, move to the next.
- **Maintain systemic awareness**—Keep your eye on all six elements, even while focusing on one.
- **Continue theological reflection**—Regularly engage Scripture and mission-shaped theology together.
- **Preserve mission as the organizing principle**—Don't let mission become one activity among many. Keep it central.

**How to know you're on track:** When you see increasing missional engagement, growing multiplication capacity, and a culture that supports ongoing experimentation and learning.

## Common Scenarios

### Small Church Implementation

**Adaptations for small contexts:**
- Leverage your small size as an advantage—you can move faster and adapt more quickly
- Focus on developing a few key practices rather than trying to do everything
- Use your relational closeness to develop communitas more easily
- Don't feel you need all the resources—start with what you have

**Small church examples:**
- Third Place Communities—A small missional community that meets in a pub
- The Joshua Tree—A small group that gathers for breakfast at the beach
- Many small churches have found that their size actually helps them be more missional

### Large Church Implementation

**Adaptations for large contexts:**
- Start with a pilot group or ministry area rather than trying to change the whole church at once
- Use your resources to provide training and support for multiple action groups
- Create parallel structures that can model movemental approaches
- Be patient—change in large organizations takes longer

**Large church examples:**
- See *On the Verge* for examples of large churches transitioning toward missional movements
- Some megachurches have created missional communities within their larger structure

### New Church Plant Implementation

**Advantages:**
- You can lay down the movemental approach from the start
- You can build mDNA into the "stem cells" of the church
- You don't have to unlearn as much

**What to do:**
- Make sure your core team understands mDNA before you launch
- Build practices into your DNA from the beginning
- Create a multiplication ethos from day one
- Avoid common mistakes like over-programming or building attractional structures

### Established Church Transformation

**Challenges:**
- Working with existing structures and patterns
- Managing resistance from those comfortable with the status quo
- Unlearning deeply embedded institutional patterns

**Strategies:**
- Start with a committed core group
- Use the strategic approach—focus on the weakest element first
- Be realistic about timelines—this will take years, not months
- Create wins early to build momentum
- Don't try to change everything at once

**Managing resistance:**
- Help people understand the "why" before the "what"
- Acknowledge the difficulty and provide support
- Celebrate small wins
- Don't force change—invite people into the journey

## Troubleshooting

### What to Do When Things Go Wrong

**Common obstacles and solutions:**

1. **"We're too busy"**
   - **Solution:** Simplify your church life. Limit in-house gatherings. Free up time for mission. Remember: nothing can be loved at speed.

2. **"People aren't getting it"**
   - **Solution:** Go back to the basics. Make sure key leaders have read *The Forgotten Ways*. Use the handbook's group learning process. Be patient—paradigm shifts take time.

3. **"We tried it and it didn't work"**
   - **Solution:** Failure is only failure if you don't learn from it. What did you learn? What would you do differently? Experimentation is essential—just try again.

4. **"We're losing people"**
   - **Solution:** Some people will leave. That's okay. Focus on those who are committed to the journey. Better to have a smaller group that's missional than a larger group that's not.

5. **"We're stuck"**
   - **Solution:** Reassess. Take the missional fitness test again. Identify what's blocking you. Get outside help—a coach, consultant, or another church that's further along.

### How to Address Resistance

**Types of resistance and how to handle them:**

- **Intellectual resistance**—People who don't understand or disagree with the concepts
  - Provide education and resources
  - Use stories and examples
  - Be patient and answer questions

- **Emotional resistance**—People who are afraid of change
  - Acknowledge their fears
  - Provide support and encouragement
  - Move slowly and create safety

- **Institutional resistance**—Systems and structures that resist change
  - Identify what needs to change structurally
  - Create new structures alongside old ones
  - Gradually transition

- **Spiritual resistance**—Powers and principalities that resist transformation
  - Recognize this is spiritual warfare
  - Pray together regularly
  - Seek God's guidance and power

### Course Correction Strategies

**When to pause and reassess:**

- If you've been working on an element for 12+ months with no progress
- If you're experiencing significant conflict or division
- If key leaders are losing heart or leaving
- If you've lost sight of why you're doing this

**How to course correct:**

1. **Stop and pray**—Seek God's guidance
2. **Reassess honestly**—What's working? What's not?
3. **Get outside perspective**—Talk to a coach or another church
4. **Adjust your approach**—Maybe you need to focus on a different element or try a different strategy
5. **Renew your commitment**—Remember why you started this journey

## Measuring Progress

### How to Know If Implementation Is Working

**Key indicators to track:**

1. **Increased missional engagement**
   - Are more people engaging in mission outside the church?
   - Are relationships developing with those beyond the faith community?
   - Are people "going out" and "going deep"?

2. **Growing multiplication capacity**
   - Are new initiatives being started?
   - Are new communities being formed?
   - Is there a culture of sending and multiplication?

3. **Cultural shift**
   - Is mission becoming a way of life rather than a program?
   - Are people taking more risks?
   - Is there more experimentation and innovation?

4. **Systemic health**
   - Are all six mDNA elements present and functioning?
   - Is there alignment between values and practices?
   - Is the system becoming more movemental?

### Assessment Questions

**Regular questions to ask:**

- Are we moving away from or toward our primary calling as a missionary people?
- Which mDNA element is strongest? Which is weakest?
- What practices are we actually doing (not just saying we value)?
- Are we seeing multiplication? Where?
- What stories of missional engagement can we tell?
- Where is God at work? How can we join him?

### What Success Looks Like

Success doesn't mean you've "arrived"—it means you're on the journey and making progress. Look for:

- **Movemental energy**—There's a sense of momentum and possibility
- **Missional engagement**—People are actively engaging in mission
- **Multiplication**—New things are being birthed
- **Communitas**—Deep community is forming through shared mission
- **Systemic alignment**—All six mDNA elements are present and working together

### How to Measure Impact

- **Quantitative measures:**
  - Number of people engaged in missional practices
  - Number of new initiatives started
  - Number of relationships with those beyond the faith
  - Missional fitness test scores over time

- **Qualitative measures:**
  - Stories of transformation
  - Depth of relationships
  - Quality of missional engagement
  - Cultural shift toward mission

## Case Studies

### Third Place Communities (TPC)

**Context:** A missional community in Hobart, Tasmania, that meets weekly at a neighborhood pub.

**What they did:**
- Located themselves in a third place (the pub) rather than a church building
- Developed proximity, frequency, and spontaneity
- Created an environment of hospitality where people belong before they believe
- Focused on going out and going deep

**Lessons learned:**
- Mission happens in the natural rhythms of life
- Third places are powerful contexts for mission
- Hospitality creates belonging before belief
- Simplicity enables multiplication

**Transferable principles:**
- Find where people are already gathering
- Become a regular presence
- Create environments of belonging
- Keep it simple and reproducible

### InnerCHANGE

**Context:** A mission order committed to sharing good news among low socioeconomic communities.

**What they did:**
- Made a collective commitment to spend 80% of their time in the local neighborhood
- Moved into the neighborhoods they were serving (not just visiting)
- Developed deep relationships through proximity and frequency
- Created communities of faith within the host community

**Lessons learned:**
- Proximity is essential—you can't drive in and out of people's lives
- Commitment to place enables deep engagement
- Living among people creates authentic relationships
- Mission requires significant time investment

**Transferable principles:**
- Make proximity a priority
- Commit to place
- Spend significant time in the community
- Live where you serve

### Upstream Communities

**Context:** Five families in Western Australia who sold their homes and relocated to a new suburban development.

**What they did:**
- Made a radical commitment to proximity by relocating
- Started fresh in a new community
- Built relationships from the ground up
- Created a missional community in their new context

**Lessons learned:**
- Sometimes proximity requires significant sacrifice
- Starting fresh can be easier than transforming existing structures
- Relocation can be a powerful missional strategy
- Community support makes radical moves possible

**Transferable principles:**
- Consider relocation as a missional strategy
- Start with a committed core group
- Build relationships from the beginning
- Support one another in the journey

## Next Steps

### How to Build on Initial Implementation

Once you've begun to embed mDNA, the work continues. Here's how to deepen and expand:

1. **Strengthen each element systematically**—Continue the process of identifying and strengthening the weakest element
2. **Develop more practices**—As you grow, develop more sophisticated practices
3. **Multiply**—Start new initiatives and communities
4. **Train others**—Develop leaders who can guide others on this journey
5. **Network**—Connect with other churches and movements on similar journeys

### Deepening Engagement

- **Go deeper theologically**—Continue to reflect on mission-shaped theology
- **Develop more sophisticated practices**—As you learn, refine your practices
- **Expand your impact**—Look for ways to have greater influence in your community
- **Share your learning**—Help other churches on similar journeys

### Continuing Development

- **Regular assessment**—Continue to take the missional fitness test regularly
- **Ongoing learning**—Read, attend conferences, learn from others
- **Adaptation**—Be willing to adapt as you learn and as contexts change
- **Persistence**—Don't give up. This is a long-term journey.

### Advanced Applications

- **Movement multiplication**—Move from church planting to movement planting
- **Network development**—Create networks of missional churches
- **Systemic transformation**—Work for transformation at denominational or network levels
- **Cultural impact**—Seek to have transformative impact on your broader culture

## Encouragement and Realistic Expectations

### Acknowledging Difficulty

Let's be honest: this is hard work. Embedding mDNA requires:
- **Paradigmatic change**—Fundamental shifts in thinking
- **Long-term commitment**—This takes years, not months
- **Significant effort**—It requires work, not just interest
- **Risk-taking**—You'll need to try things that might not work
- **Perseverance**—You'll face obstacles and resistance

### Maintaining Hope

But here's the good news:
- **Apostolic Genius is already present**—You're not creating something new, just awakening what's already there
- **God is at work**—The Holy Spirit is eager to awaken God's people to their calling
- **It's possible**—Churches across the West are rediscovering movemental forms
- **You're not alone**—Many others are on this journey
- **Small steps matter**—Every step forward is progress

### Realistic Timelines

- **Initial assessment and planning:** 2-3 months
- **First element development:** 6-12 months
- **Systemic embedding:** 2-3 years minimum
- **Full transformation:** 5-10 years (or more for established churches)

**Remember:** The Chinese church proves that highly institutionalized forms can become powerful movements. You don't need persecution—less intense adaptive challenges can force the church to respond.

### Encouragement for the Journey

You're not trying to become exactly like the early church or the Chinese underground church. You're seeking to approximate movemental characteristics in your context. Most churches will always be hybrids—a mixture of organic and institutional elements. The challenge is to continually move toward being more movemental.

At a certain catalytic moment, when the six elements are present and interacting significantly, spontaneous expansion will begin to occur. You'll know it when you see it—there will be a sense of momentum, multiplication, and transformative impact.

### Celebrating Progress

Don't wait for perfection to celebrate. Celebrate:
- Small wins
- People taking risks
- New relationships formed
- Stories of missional engagement
- Any movement toward mission

Every step forward is worth celebrating. This is a journey, not a destination.
