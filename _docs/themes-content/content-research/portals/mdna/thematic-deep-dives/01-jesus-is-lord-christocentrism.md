# Jesus is Lord / Christocentrism: The Heart of It All

## Theme Overview

"Jesus is Lord" is not merely one element among six in movement DNA—it is the absolute center from which all other themes radiate. This foundational confession represents the core of biblical monotheism, rooted in the Shema Yisrael ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"). It touches on the nature of God, his relation to the world, and his covenantal relationship with his people. This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether Caesar, consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god. It is inherently political, inherently revolutionary, and inherently missional.

When persecution forces movements to distill their message to its essence, what remains is not complex theology or elaborate systems, but this simple yet profound confession: Jesus is Lord. The gospel must be simple enough to be transferred from person to person, easily grasped by illiterate peasants, yet profound enough to transform entire cultures. This simplicity is not reductionism but essence—the core truth that all else depends upon.

This theme runs throughout the corpus, finding particular expression in the call to "reJesus" the church—to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms. Christology determines missiology, which in turn determines ecclesiology. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right, and we cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

The lordship of Jesus is not just a theological proposition to be assented to; it is a reality to be lived. It demands total allegiance, reshaping every dimension of life. It challenges the powers, subverts the status quo, and calls forth a community that lives as if this confession is actually true. This is why movements that maintain this centrality of Christ find themselves both persecuted and powerful—persecuted because they challenge false authorities, powerful because they tap into the very source of life itself.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of "Jesus is Lord" appears consistently throughout all thirteen published works, though its expression deepens and expands over time. In **The Forgotten Ways** (2006), this theme is established as the foundational element of movement DNA, with Chapter 4 dedicated entirely to "The Heart of It All: Jesus Is Lord." Here, the connection to the Shema Yisrael is made explicit, showing how the confession represents the distillation of monotheism into its essence.

**ReJesus** (2009, with Michael Frost) represents a significant expansion of this theme, dedicating the entire book to the call to "reJesus" the church. The opening chapter, "How Jesus Changes Everything," establishes that most of the Church's ailments can be traced back to a deficiency in understanding and engaging with Jesus. The book argues that a correction at the point of Christology promises the best chance of renewal in any time and any place. Throughout, the authors show how seeing God, the church, and the world through Jesus' eyes fundamentally reshapes everything.

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch) takes this theme into the realm of discipleship, showing how "Jesus-shaped discipleship" must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Chapter 1, "Jeebus Made Me Do It," exposes the ways we have domesticated and sanitized Jesus, creating a "Jeebus" who looks more like us than the wild Messiah of the Gospels. The book argues that whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples—every aspect of life must be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship.

**Disciplism** (2014) brings this theme to bear specifically on the relationship between discipleship and evangelism. Chapter 6, "It's All About Jesus. No, Really, It Is.," argues that discipleship is basically our lifelong and heartfelt response to Jesus as Lord and Savior. The book critiques how Western Christians have tended to emphasize one aspect of Jesus' ministry (salvation through the cross) while diminishing others (his words, actions, and calling on our lives). This divorce between salvation theology and kingdom theology strikes a deadly blow at the theological epicenter of the believer's life.

**Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson) addresses this theme through the lens of cultural engagement, showing how the gospel has been reduced to narrow frames that fail to capture the full person of Jesus. The book calls for "remystifying," "repoeticizing," and "remythologizing" our understanding of God, people, and mission—all of which requires seeing through the lens of Jesus.

**Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly) develops this theme through the concept of "Christo-logic"—seeing the world from inside the mind that created it. Chapter 4, "Christo-Logic: Seeing the World from Inside the Mind That Created It," argues that metanoia calibrates the believer to Christ, who is also the Word of God. Christo-logic is the kind of logic derived from the pattern of Christ, enabling us to see everything from God's perspective, think holistically, and discern what God is doing to join with him.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: Jesus is Lord, and everything must be understood and lived in relation to this central confession. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different dimensions—theological, missional, discipleship, cultural engagement, and organizational transformation.

## Theological Foundations

The confession "Jesus is Lord" is rooted in the most fundamental theological claims of the Christian faith. It represents the fulfillment of the Shema Yisrael, the central confession of Israel: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength" (Deuteronomy 6:4-5). When Jesus affirms this as the greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-31), he places it at the epicenter of what it means to be a true disciple.

The New Testament reveals that this monotheism is now "christocentric monotheism"—monotheism realigned around the central character of the New Testament, Jesus Christ. As Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 8:6: "For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live."

This confession touches on several core Christian doctrines:

**The Doctrine of God**: The confession reveals God as the one true God who will not share his people with false gods. It eliminates polytheism and idolatry, calling for exclusive allegiance to the one God revealed in Jesus.

**The Doctrine of Christ**: Jesus is not merely a teacher or prophet, but the Lord—the one through whom all things came and through whom we live. His lordship is executive and comprehensive, touching every aspect of creation and redemption.

**The Doctrine of the Kingdom**: The confession "Jesus is Lord" is inherently about the kingdom of God—the rule of God in and through Jesus. When Jesus says "seek first his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33), he is entirely consistent with the basic dynamic of the Shema.

**The Doctrine of the Church**: The church exists as the people who confess "Jesus is Lord" and live under his rule. This confession defines the church's identity, mission, and way of being in the world.

**The Doctrine of Mission**: Mission flows from the lordship of Jesus. Because Jesus is Lord, the church is sent into the world to bear witness to this reality and invite others into allegiance to him.

The biblical narrative shows that this confession was inherently political and revolutionary. In the Roman Empire, the confession "Caesar is Lord" was required for political loyalty. The early church's refusal to make this confession, choosing instead "Jesus is Lord," led to persecution. Similarly, in contemporary contexts, the confession challenges all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether consumerism, nationalism, ideologies, or any other false god.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements that have maintained the centrality of "Jesus is Lord" have demonstrated remarkable vitality and transformative power. The early church, despite persecution, grew exponentially because it refused to compromise on this central confession. When everything else was stripped away—buildings, professional clergy, elaborate theologies—what remained was the simple confession: Jesus is Lord.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful contemporary example. When all church buildings were confiscated, all professional leaders killed or imprisoned, and all access to outside sources cut off, the church was forced to distill its message to its essence. The result was a recovery of the simple confession "Jesus is Lord" and exponential growth from around 2 million to 120 million in seventy years.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe maintained this simplicity, focusing on Jesus as the center of all things. The early Methodists, under John Wesley, recovered this centrality, leading to remarkable growth throughout Great Britain and America. The Moravians, early Pentecostals, and other movements that have changed the world have all maintained this foundational confession at their core.

Conversely, movements that have lost this centrality have declined. When Methodism in America required seminary training for circuit riders and moved away from the simple confession to more complex theological systems, growth stalled and never recovered. When churches have allowed other concerns—whether institutional maintenance, cultural accommodation, or theological sophistication—to displace the centrality of Jesus, they have lost their transformative power.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain "Jesus is Lord" at the center thrive, even under persecution. Movements that allow this confession to be marginalized or complicated decline, even with resources and favorable conditions.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the confession "Jesus is Lord" faces particular challenges. Consumerism functions as a competing religion, offering identity, purpose, and meaning through consumption rather than through allegiance to Jesus. Nationalism and political ideologies claim ultimate loyalty. Individualism elevates personal autonomy above the lordship of Christ. The church itself has often domesticated Jesus, making him manageable and safe rather than the revolutionary Lord who demands everything.

The call to "reJesus" the church is urgent. Churches must recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms. This means:

**In Theology**: All understanding of God must be filtered through Jesus. As Albert Nolan states, "We cannot deduce anything about Jesus from what we think we know about God; we must deduce everything about God from what we do know about Jesus." God is like Jesus, not the other way around.

**In Discipleship**: Following Jesus means becoming like him—little Jesuses infiltrating every nook and cranny of society. Discipleship is not about learning information but about embodying the message and mission of Jesus.

**In Mission**: Mission flows from the lordship of Jesus. Because Jesus is Lord, we are sent into the world to bear witness to this reality. The missional-incarnational impulse is rooted in the fact that Jesus came to us, and we are sent as he was sent.

**In Community**: The church exists as the people who confess "Jesus is Lord" together. This confession creates a community that lives under his rule and extends his mission.

**In Culture**: The lordship of Jesus challenges all competing claims to authority in culture. There is no "sacred" and "secular" divide—all of life belongs to God and must come under the claim of Jesus' lordship.

The contemporary application requires courage to live as if this confession is actually true, even when it challenges cultural norms, political powers, and religious institutions.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of "Jesus is Lord" connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Anthropology**: The study of how movements maintain core DNA while adapting to contexts illuminates how the simple confession "Jesus is Lord" can be both universal and contextual. Victor Turner's work on liminality and communitas shows how threshold experiences force movements to distill to essence.

**Organizational Theory**: The concept of "chaordic" organizations (combining chaos and order) developed by Dee Hock shows how movements can maintain core principles (like "Jesus is Lord") while allowing creative adaptation at the edges. This mirrors how the confession provides order at the center while allowing contextual expression.

**Sociology**: Research on social movements shows that successful movements maintain a clear, simple, transferable core message. The confession "Jesus is Lord" functions as this core message, easily transferable yet profoundly transformative.

**Psychology**: Studies on identity formation show that people need a clear center around which to organize their lives. The lordship of Jesus provides this center, giving identity, purpose, and meaning that transcends cultural and personal limitations.

**Political Science**: The inherently political nature of the confession "Jesus is Lord" challenges all competing claims to authority. This has been evident throughout history, from the Roman Empire to contemporary totalitarian states.

**Communication Theory**: The study of "ideaviruses" and "memes" shows how ideas spread. The confession "Jesus is Lord" functions as a powerful ideavirus when it is simple, transferable, and embodied in authentic lives.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how "Jesus is Lord" functions as both theological confession and practical organizing principle for transformative movements.

## Practical Implications

The confession "Jesus is Lord" has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must constantly recalibrate around Jesus. This means making the Gospels the primary text, shaping all practices around following Jesus, and ensuring that everything—worship, community, mission, leadership—flows from the lordship of Jesus. Churches must resist the temptation to make Jesus manageable or to allow other concerns to displace his centrality.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model what it means to live under the lordship of Jesus. This means personal discipleship that takes Jesus seriously, leadership that serves rather than dominates, and vision that flows from understanding who Jesus is and what he came to do. Leaders must constantly ask: "What would Jesus do?" not as a cliché but as a genuine question that shapes decisions and actions.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must make the confession "Jesus is Lord" the organizing center of their life. This means bringing every aspect of life—work, family, money, sexuality, politics, culture—under the claim of Jesus' lordship. There can be no "sacred" and "secular" divide. All of life belongs to God and must be lived in response to the lordship of Jesus.

**Specific Applications**:
- Make the Gospels the primary text for understanding God, mission, and church
- Practice "Shema spirituality"—loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength
- Eliminate dualistic thinking that separates "sacred" and "secular"
- Challenge all competing claims to ultimate authority
- Shape all practices around following Jesus
- Ensure that mission flows from understanding who Jesus is
- Create communities that live as if "Jesus is Lord" is actually true

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we maintain the simplicity of "Jesus is Lord" while engaging with complex theological questions?** The confession must remain simple and transferable, yet it must also be able to engage with the complexities of contemporary life and thought.

**How do we live under the lordship of Jesus in contexts where this confession is dangerous?** Many Christians around the world face persecution for this confession. How do we support them while also challenging the powers in our own contexts?

**How do we avoid domesticating Jesus while making him accessible?** There is a tension between maintaining the wild, untamed Jesus of the Gospels and making him relatable to contemporary people. How do we navigate this tension?

**How do we challenge competing claims to authority without becoming merely political?** The confession "Jesus is Lord" is inherently political, but how do we engage politically without reducing the gospel to a political agenda?

**How do we maintain this centrality in movements that grow and scale?** As movements grow, there is a tendency to add complexity and lose simplicity. How do we maintain the centrality of "Jesus is Lord" even as movements expand?

**How do we help people move from intellectual assent to lived reality?** Many people can say "Jesus is Lord" but don't live as if it's true. How do we facilitate the transformation from confession to embodiment?

These questions require ongoing conversation, prayer, and discernment as we seek to live faithfully under the lordship of Jesus.
