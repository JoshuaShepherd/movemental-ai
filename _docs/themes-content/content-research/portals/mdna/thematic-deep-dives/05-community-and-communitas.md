# Community and Communitas: The Edge of Adventure

## Theme Overview

There is a profound difference between community and communitas, and understanding this distinction is essential for grasping how movements form and thrive. Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?" Community is maintained through programs and activities. Communitas is maintained through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself.

Communitas is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences—those threshold moments when we find ourselves in transition, outside normal structures, facing risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough. It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

The term comes from the anthropological work of Victor Turner, who studied rites of passage among African people groups. He observed that when people are driven to find one another through a common experience of ordeal, humbling, transition, and marginalization, they develop intense feelings of social togetherness and belonging. This sense of comradeship forged in testing conditions is what Turner called communitas.

Liminality and communitas are inextricably linked. Liminality refers to threshold experiences—those times when people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society, a place that could involve significant danger and disorientation. Communitas is what emerges from these liminal experiences. You cannot have communitas without liminality, and liminality naturally creates the conditions for communitas to form.

This theme is one of the six essential elements of movement DNA (mDNA), and its loss leads to a diminution of Apostolic Genius. When churches prioritize safety, comfort, and stability over mission and adventure, they lose the liminal edge and replace communitas with consumeristic community. The result is a church that "huddles and cuddles" rather than one that forms itself around a common mission that calls it to a dangerous journey.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of communitas and liminality appears throughout the corpus, receiving its most comprehensive treatment in **The Forgotten Ways** (2006) and **The Faith of Leap** (2012, with Michael Frost), but it is also developed in other works.

**The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas," establishes this as one of the six essential elements of mDNA. The chapter draws on Victor Turner's anthropological work to explain how movements form through shared ordeal and adventure. It distinguishes between community (the settled experience of a group focused on insiders) and communitas (the journey of a group that finds each other around a mission that lies beyond itself). The chapter argues that liminality and communitas are normative for the pilgrim people of God, not temporary experiences but the ongoing condition of missional movements.

**The Forgotten Ways Handbook** (2012, with Darryn Altclass): Chapter 7, "Communitas, Not Community," provides practical guidance for developing communitas. It outlines four habits: developing a transformative vision, positioning the church within the hub of life, engaging in shared endeavors, and putting adventure back into the venture. The chapter includes specific practices for each habit, helping churches move from community to communitas.

**The Faith of Leap** (2012, with Michael Frost): This entire book is dedicated to exploring adventure, risk, and communitas in Christian discipleship. Chapter 1, "The Spirit's Edge," argues that adventure is intrinsic to authentic Christian discipleship. Chapter 2, "Jesus Is My Disequilibrium: Where Friends Become Comrades," develops the concept of communitas in depth, drawing on examples from skydiving, war, sports teams, and biblical narratives. The book argues that Christianity is an adventure of the spirit or it is not Christianity, and that removing adventure from the Christian life domesticates it, making it safe, predictable, and ultimately powerless.

**On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Chapter 3, "Verge-ination," references communitas as part of the mDNA framework, emphasizing its role in creating esprit de corps and overcoming the risk averseness of prevailing forms of church. The book integrates communitas into the broader framework of transitioning large churches toward missional movements.

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): While not explicitly using the term communitas, the book explores related themes of risk, adventure, and untamed discipleship that create the conditions for communitas to form. The emphasis on "going out and going deep" and engaging in missional adventure naturally leads to communitas.

**Metanoia** (2022, with Rob Kelly): Chapter 6, "The Metanoia Journey," touches on liminality as part of the transformation process. The U-shaped curve of the Metanoia Journey involves liminal experiences that create the conditions for deep community to form.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: communitas is not optional but essential for movements. It is the type of community that forms when people engage in shared mission and adventure, facing challenges together that require them to rely on one another. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different contexts—from small missional communities to large churches transitioning toward movements, from personal discipleship to organizational transformation.

## Theological Foundations

The claim that communitas and liminality are normative for God's people is thoroughly biblical. When we examine Scripture with the liminality-communitas framework in mind, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the most theologically fertile sections are formed in times of precisely such situations.

The biblical narrative is filled with liminal experiences that create communitas. Take Abram (later Abraham), who with his entire extended family is called by God to leave house and home to undertake a very risky journey to an unknown land. The experiences they have along the way—stories that have shaped all subsequent faith—are not safe little bedtime stories. Rather they call us to a dangerous form of faithfulness that echoes the faithfulness of Abraham (Galatians 3:15ff; Hebrews 11:8-13).

The exodus experience is profoundly liminal. This very tricky journey permanently shaped the people of God and continues to do so to this day. It was also the context of the substantial revelation of God in his covenant with his people. The same can be said of the exile into Babylon centuries later—this was an extreme situation that changed the whole way Israel related to its God.

The prophets spoke the Word of God into contexts of extremity. It was precisely when the people of God settled down and "forgot YHWH" (Deuteronomy 4:23-31) that they had to be spiritually disturbed once again by the prophets. To awaken the people to their lost calling, the prophets recalled the dangerous memories about fires on the mountain and pursuing armies and a God who lovingly redeems a people and enters into a sacred and eternal covenant with them.

When we consider the lives and ministries of Samuel, Elijah, Samson, and David and his band, we come up with the consistent themes of liminality and communitas. And when we come to the New Testament, we need only to look to the life of Jesus. He had nowhere to lay his head, and he discipled his followers on the road in the dangerous conditions of an occupied land, against a hostile religious elite.

The book of Acts is so filled with communitas and liminality that it reads like a rollicking adventure story. Paul describes his experience vividly in 2 Corinthians: whippings, beatings, imprisonment, and shipwrecks can hardly be called safe, secure, comfortable, and convenient. Yet through these experiences, he and his apostolic band totally realign the course of history around the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The book of Hebrews is particularly significant for understanding communitas. It calls us to be God's pilgrim people who will faithfully testify, by their continuing status as exiles and strangers, to their desire for a better country, a heavenly city, a homeland (Hebrews 11). By their very pilgrimage, they give witness that they are in fact already citizens of that community. Hebrews pictures the Christian community on earth as living like Abraham in tents "in the land of promise, as in a foreign land" (Hebrews 11:9).

The theological foundation shows that communitas is not a human invention but a divine design. God's people are meant to be a pilgrim people, a communitas of exiles and strangers, living in liminal spaces that create the conditions for deep community to form. This is not a temporary state but the normative condition of the people of God.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements of renewal and transformation have been characterized by communitas. The early church experienced communitas through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. Stripped of buildings, resources, and external support, they were forced to rediscover the "uncluttered simplicity" of the gospel, centering entirely on the lordship of Jesus and forming deep bonds through shared ordeal.

The Chinese underground church, which grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under intense persecution, is a powerful example of communitas. Forced into liminal spaces by persecution, they developed a deep sense of comradeship forged in testing conditions. This communitas enabled them to thrive and multiply even in the most hostile environments.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe maintained a commitment to liminality and communitas. The Celtic monks were known for their peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They left their homeland, their security, and their comfort to engage in dangerous mission, and in doing so they formed deep communitas that enabled them to transform entire cultures.

The Moravians, who sent out more missionaries in the first twenty years of their movement than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years, were characterized by communitas. Their commitment to dangerous mission created liminal experiences that forged deep bonds of comradeship.

Contemporary movements that are experiencing transformation—whether various missional movements, renewal movements within denominations, or underground churches in hostile contexts—all demonstrate the capacity for communitas. They are willing to engage in liminal experiences, to take risks, to face challenges together, and in doing so they form the deep community that enables movements to thrive.

Conversely, movements that have lost the capacity for communitas have declined. When churches prioritize safety and comfort, when they avoid risk and adventure, when they "huddle and cuddle" rather than engage in shared mission, they lose the liminal edge and replace communitas with consumeristic community. The result is a church that may be comfortable but lacks the transformative power of movements.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain communitas thrive, movements that lose it decline. Communitas is not optional but essential for movements to form and multiply.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the church faces significant challenges in maintaining communitas. Middle-class culture, with its focus on security, consumption, and risk-aversion, functions as an "anti-missional virus" that gradually erodes the liminal edge and replaces communitas with consumeristic community.

The contemporary application requires:

**Recognizing the Loss of Communitas**: Most Western churches have lost communitas, replacing it with community focused on comfort, safety, and serving insiders. This loss is not intentional but happens gradually as churches prioritize stability over mission, comfort over challenge, safety over adventure.

**Creating Liminal Experiences**: Churches must intentionally create liminal experiences that call people out of their comfort zones. This might involve engaging at the edges of society, taking risks for the sake of mission, embracing uncertainty rather than trying to control everything, prioritizing purpose over comfort, and creating environments where people can experience shared challenge and adventure.

**Organizing Around Mission**: Gordon Cosby observed that in over sixty years of ministry, he had never seen a group that came together around a nonmissional purpose ever end up becoming missional. It was only those groups that set out to be missional that actually got around to doing it. This means organizing the church's life around mission (our role outside of the church), not ministry (our relationships with one another).

**Developing Transformative Vision**: Cultivating a vigorous transformative vision can create liminality and communitas. Holding a definite sense of vision and mission informs and alters how people think and behave in the present. When we are caught up in a vision and pursue it, we are changed, and we go on to enact history. This is "managing from the future"—establishing a compelling goal that draws the organization out of its comfort zone.

**Engaging in Shared Endeavors**: Communitas forms when people engage in shared endeavors—working shoulder-to-shoulder on meaningful projects that require cooperation and mutual reliance. This might involve joint community projects, engaging in mission together, or participating in adventure activities that create liminal experiences.

**Putting Adventure Back into the Venture**: Communitas involves adventure, risk, and experimentation. Churches must overcome their desire to "huddle and cuddle" and instead form around a common mission that calls them out of their burrow and into a risky adventure. This requires courage, commitment, integrity, and hard work.

The contemporary application requires churches to resist the pull of middle-class culture toward safety and comfort, and instead embrace the liminal edge that creates communitas. This is not about creating unsustainable adrenaline-junkie culture but about embedding adventure and risk into the very DNA of the church.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of communitas and liminality connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Anthropology**: Victor Turner's work on liminality and communitas provides the foundational framework. His study of rites of passage among African people groups shows how liminal experiences create communitas, and how this dynamic is essential for cultural regeneration. His later work on artists and subcultures shows how liminal people are often the catalysts for social change.

**Sociology**: The study of how communities form and function shows the difference between communities of interest (regular community) and communities of purpose (communitas). The work on "tribes" and subcultures illuminates how communitas forms around shared mission and adventure.

**Psychology**: The study of how people learn and grow shows that liminal experiences are essential for development. The work on "flow" states and peak experiences shows how total absorption in challenging activities creates deep connection and meaning.

**Organizational Theory**: The study of how organizations adapt and change shows that liminal experiences are essential for transformation. The work on "edge of chaos" and "requisite variety" shows how systems need liminal experiences to remain adaptive and responsive.

**Theology**: The study of pilgrimage, exile, and mission shows how these liminal experiences are central to the biblical narrative. The work on missional theology shows how the church is called to be a pilgrim people, living in liminal spaces.

**Leadership Studies**: The study of how leaders facilitate change shows how liminal experiences create the conditions for transformation. The work on "adaptive leadership" and "transformational leadership" shows how leaders must create liminal experiences that enable communitas to form.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how communitas functions as both spiritual reality and practical process for forming deep community.

## Practical Implications

The theme of communitas and liminality has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must become places where communitas can form. This means creating environments that value adventure and risk, organizing around mission rather than ministry, engaging at the edges of society, and developing transformative vision that calls people out of their comfort zones. Churches must resist the pull toward safety and comfort and instead embrace the liminal edge.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model communitas, demonstrating willingness to engage in liminal experiences, to take risks, and to face challenges together. Leaders must create environments where communitas can flourish, providing frameworks and practices that enable liminal experiences. Leaders must recognize that you cannot lead where you will not go; you cannot teach what you do not know.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to engaging in liminal experiences that create communitas. This means being willing to leave comfort zones, to take risks for the sake of mission, to engage in shared adventure, and to form deep bonds through shared challenge. Disciples must resist the pull toward safety and instead embrace the adventure of following Jesus.

**Specific Applications**:
- Develop transformative vision that calls people out of comfort zones
- Organize church life around mission, not ministry
- Create regular opportunities for shared adventure and risk
- Engage in joint community projects that require cooperation
- Position the church within the hub of life, not separate from it
- Develop a hero system that values adventure and mission
- Ritualize liminality-communitas experiences into church culture
- Create mentor systems that transfer communitas from generation to generation
- Measure success by mission and adventure, not just attendance and programs
- Resist the pull of middle-class culture toward safety and comfort

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we create communitas without creating unsustainable adrenaline-junkie culture?** Adventure and risk are essential, but how do we embed them into sustainable rhythms rather than creating unsustainable peaks and valleys?

**How do we maintain communitas as movements grow and become more established?** There is a natural tendency for movements to lose their liminal edge as they grow. How do we maintain communitas even as we create necessary structures?

**How do we create liminal experiences in safe, comfortable, middle-class contexts?** Most Western churches exist in contexts that prioritize safety and comfort. How do we create liminal experiences that call people out of these comfort zones?

**How do we organize around mission without neglecting the need for community and care?** Mission is the organizing principle, but people also need community and care. How do we balance these needs?

**How do we develop transformative vision that actually transforms?** Many churches have vision statements, but few have vision that actually creates liminality and communitas. How do we develop vision that draws people out of comfort zones?

**How do we measure communitas?** Traditional metrics don't capture communitas. How do we know when communitas is present and when it is absent?

**How do we create communitas in diverse contexts?** Different contexts require different approaches. How do we create communitas in urban, suburban, rural, and cross-cultural contexts?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to recover communitas in contemporary contexts.

This theme represents the essential dynamic that enables movements to form deep community through shared mission and adventure. Without communitas, community becomes consumeristic and movements lose their transformative power. With communitas, movements form the deep bonds that enable them to thrive and multiply even in the most challenging contexts.
