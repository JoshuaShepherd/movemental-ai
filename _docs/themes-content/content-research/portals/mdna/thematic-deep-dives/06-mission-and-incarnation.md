# Mission and Incarnation: Going Out and Going Deep

## Theme Overview

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). These are not separate activities but two dimensions of the same reality, rooted in the missio Dei (the sending of God) and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ. Like scissor blades that work together, these two impulses combine to extend the gospel into every culture and context.

The **missional impulse** refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God is a missionary God, and the church exists as a missionary people. This impulse is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

The missional impulse can be visualized as seeds being scattered by the wind, spreading the DNA of the gospel into new contexts. It is the sneeze that cannot be suppressed, the outward movement that characterizes all authentic mission. When this impulse is blocked—when churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches—they cut themselves off from the very dynamic that enables cultural impact.

The **incarnational impulse** refers to the deep identification with culture, the "enfleshing" of the gospel in specific contexts. Just as God became fully human in Jesus, taking on flesh and dwelling among us, so too must the church become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. The incarnation demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

Incarnational mission involves six key practices: **Presence** (full identification with culture), **Proximity** (geographic and relational closeness), **Powerlessness** (humility and vulnerability), **Prevenience** (recognizing God's work already present), **Passion** (embracing redemptive suffering), and **Proclamation** (sharing the good news). These practices enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society, becoming good news in flesh and blood as well as word.

The missional-incarnational impulse is one of the six essential elements of movement DNA (mDNA), and it is one of the most easily suppressed. When replaced by the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern, the church loses its capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers. The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, and the church is intrinsically incarnational—it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of missional-incarnational impulse appears throughout the corpus, receiving comprehensive treatment in multiple works.

**The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 6, "Missional-Incarnational Impulse," establishes this as one of the six essential elements of mDNA. The chapter develops the theological foundations (missio Dei and incarnation), distinguishes between missional and incarnational impulses, and shows how they work together. It critiques the "evangelistic-attractional" pattern that blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers. The chapter emphasizes that Christology determines missiology, which in turn determines ecclesiology.

**The Forgotten Ways Handbook** (2012, with Darryn Altclass): Chapter 4, "Missional-Incarnational Impulse," provides practical guidance for developing this impulse. It outlines two basic habits (going out and going deep) with specific practices for each. The "going out" habit includes proximity, frequency, and spontaneity. The "going deep" habit includes the six P's of incarnational practice (presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, proclamation).

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 9, "Going Out, Going Deep," explores the missional implications of the incarnation. It develops the six P's of incarnational practice in depth, showing how each practice enables authentic engagement with culture. The chapter emphasizes that if incarnation is the most profound way that God engaged the world, then we must follow in his footsteps and become incarnational.

**Right Here, Right Now** (2011, with Lance Ford): Throughout, this book explores how to engage missionally in everyday contexts. It emphasizes that mission happens "right here, right now" in the ordinary places of life, not just in special programs or events.

**Reframation** (2020, with Mark Nelson): Chapter 10, "Romancing the City," explores the practice of developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This involves the art of paying attention (like Moses at the burning bush), the art of listening (learning what "good news" means to each context), and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy.

**Fast Forward to Mission** (2023): Both chapters develop this into four movements: **Move Out** (into missional engagement), **Move In** (burrowing into culture through incarnation), **Move Alongside** (engaging in relationships and community), and **Move From** (challenging dehumanizing aspects of culture). These movements provide a practical framework for everyday mission in everyday contexts.

**On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout as part of the mDNA framework, showing how large churches can transition toward missional movements by activating the missional-incarnational impulse.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: the missional-incarnational impulse is essential for movements. It is the practical outworking of the missionary God who sends the church outward into the world and deep into culture and context. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different contexts—from small missional communities to large churches, from urban to suburban settings, from Western to cross-cultural contexts.

## Theological Foundations

The missional-incarnational impulse is deeply rooted in biblical theology, drawing from two foundational doctrines: the missio Dei (mission of God) and the incarnation.

**Missio Dei (Mission of God)**: Over the past fifty years, there has been a massive shift in missiology from a church-centered understanding to a God-centered one. Mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes to restore and heal creation. God's mission began with the call of Abraham, unfolded in the history of God's people, reached its climax in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and continues today in the church's participation in God's ongoing work.

As Darrell Guder notes, "We have learned to speak of God as a 'missionary God.'" Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" (John 20:21). The church exists as a missionary people, sent by God into the world. This "sending" is embodied and lived out in the missional impulse—the outward thrust rooted in God's mission that compels the church to reach a lost world.

**The Incarnation**: John 1:1-18 forms the central defining scriptural text narrating the incarnation. When we talk of the Incarnation with a capital "I," we refer to that act of sublime love and humility whereby God takes it upon himself to enter into the depths of human experience so that reconciliation between God and humanity may be brought about. This "enfleshing" of God in Jesus demonstrates that God takes culture seriously, and so must we.

When God came into our world in and through Jesus, the Eternal moved into the neighborhood and took up residence among us (John 1:14). The central thrust of the incarnation is that by becoming one of us, God was able to achieve redemption for the human race and radical identification with all that it means to be human. Jesus is for us, quite literally, the human face of God.

The incarnation not only qualifies God's acts in the world but must also qualify ours. If God's central way of reaching his world was to incarnate himself in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be incarnational. As David Bosch writes, "The Word has to become flesh in every new context." To act incarnationally, we will need to exercise a genuine identification and affinity with those we are trying to reach.

**Theological Flow**: The missional-incarnational impulse follows a specific theological flow: Christology determines missiology, which in turn determines ecclesiology. The person and work of Jesus must directly inform our purpose and function—our mission in the world. And it is our mission that in turn must inform the structure and cultural forms of the church. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right, and we cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

This theological foundation underscores that the missional-incarnational impulse is not a human invention but a divine design, rooted in the very nature of God and the pattern of God's engagement with the world.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements that have had transformative impact have been characterized by the missional-incarnational impulse. The early church experienced this through persecution and mission, being scattered like seeds into new contexts where they became native to those cultures while maintaining their core identity.

The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe maintained a commitment to incarnational mission. The Celtic monks were known for their peregrinatio—voluntary exile for the sake of mission. They left their homeland to engage in dangerous mission, becoming native to new cultures while maintaining their core identity. They took culture seriously, adapting their methods to each context while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

The Moravians, who sent out more missionaries in the first twenty years of their movement than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years, were characterized by incarnational mission. Their commitment to deep identification with the cultures they served enabled them to have transformative impact.

Contemporary movements that are experiencing transformation—whether various missional movements, renewal movements within denominations, or underground churches in hostile contexts—all demonstrate the missional-incarnational impulse. They are willing to go out into new contexts and go deep into culture, becoming native to those contexts while maintaining their core identity.

Conversely, movements that have lost the missional-incarnational impulse have declined. When churches rely exclusively on attractional approaches, when they expect people to come to them rather than going to people, when they remain foreign to their contexts rather than becoming native, they lose their transformative power.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain the missional-incarnational impulse thrive, movements that lose it decline. This impulse is not optional but essential for movements to form and multiply.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the church faces significant challenges in maintaining the missional-incarnational impulse. The "evangelistic-attractional" pattern, while effective in certain contexts (m0-m1 on the missional scale), blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers.

The contemporary application requires:

**Moving from Attractional to Missional**: Churches must shift from expecting people to come to them (attractional) to going to people (missional). This requires a fundamental reorientation of how we understand mission and church. Instead of building better programs to attract people, we must go out into the world where people already are.

**Going Out: Proximity, Frequency, Spontaneity**: To sustain the outward impulse, missionary groups must incorporate proximity (physical closeness), frequency (regularity of connection), and spontaneity (flexibility for unplanned connections) into their collective life. This means moving into neighborhoods, frequenting third places (cafés, pubs, parks), and creating space for spontaneous relationships.

**Going Deep: The Six P's**: Incarnational mission involves six key practices: **Presence** (full identification with culture), **Proximity** (geographic and relational closeness), **Powerlessness** (humility and vulnerability), **Prevenience** (recognizing God's work already present), **Passion** (embracing redemptive suffering), and **Proclamation** (sharing the good news). These practices enable the church to engage authentically in the "nooks and crannies" of society.

**Contextualizing the Gospel**: The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, since every generation has its own unique questions. The church must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign. This requires understanding the culture, learning its language, appreciating its rhythms, and adapting methods while maintaining fidelity to the gospel.

**Church Follows Mission**: The church is a dynamic expression of the people of God in any given place. Worship style, social dynamics, and liturgical expressions must result from the process of contextualizing the gospel in any given context. When we begin with incarnational mission, the church will explore its way of life and corporate expression within each cultural context. Thus, the church will be formed out of mission and missional action specific to its context.

**Romancing the City**: Developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach involves the art of paying attention, the art of listening, and the practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy. This is courtship rather than speed dating—patient, attentive, empathetic engagement that recognizes God's prevenient grace already at work.

The contemporary application requires churches to resist the pull of attractional approaches and instead embrace the missional-incarnational impulse that enables authentic engagement with culture.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of missional-incarnational impulse connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Anthropology**: The study of culture and cross-cultural engagement illuminates how the church must become native to its context. The work on contextualization shows how the gospel must be adapted to each culture while maintaining core identity. The work on cultural anthropology helps us understand how to read culture and engage authentically.

**Sociology**: The study of how communities form and function shows the importance of proximity, frequency, and spontaneity in building relationships. The work on "third places" (Ray Oldenburg) shows how social spaces enable community to form. The work on social networks shows how relationships are critical for the exponential growth of movements.

**Organizational Theory**: The study of how organizations adapt and change shows how the missional-incarnational impulse enables innovation. The work on "edge of chaos" shows how engaging at the margins enables creativity and adaptation. The work on innovation shows how the cycle of incarnation-innovation enables new forms to emerge.

**Theology**: The study of missio Dei and incarnation provides the theological foundation. The work on contextual theology shows how theology must be developed in each context. The work on missional theology shows how mission is central to the church's identity.

**Communication Theory**: The study of how messages are communicated shows the importance of embodiment. The work on cross-cultural communication shows how messages must be adapted to each context. The work on narrative shows how stories are more powerful than propositions.

**Leadership Studies**: The study of how leaders facilitate change shows how leaders must model the missional-incarnational impulse. The work on "servant leadership" shows how powerlessness is essential. The work on "adaptive leadership" shows how leaders must engage with culture.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how the missional-incarnational impulse functions as both spiritual reality and practical process for engaging culture.

## Practical Implications

The theme of missional-incarnational impulse has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must become missional-incarnational communities, organizing their life around mission rather than ministry. This means going out into the world where people already are, becoming native to their contexts, and engaging authentically with culture. Churches must resist the pull of attractional approaches and instead embrace the missional-incarnational impulse.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model the missional-incarnational impulse, demonstrating willingness to go out and go deep. Leaders must create environments where this impulse can flourish, providing frameworks and practices that enable missional-incarnational engagement. Leaders must recognize that you cannot lead where you will not go; you cannot teach what you do not know.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to missional-incarnational engagement, going out into the world and going deep into culture. This means practicing the six P's of incarnational mission, engaging in proximity, frequency, and spontaneity, and becoming native to their contexts while maintaining core identity.

**Specific Applications**:
- Practice proximity: Move into neighborhoods, frequent third places, be where people are
- Practice frequency: Develop regular rhythms of engagement with people beyond the church
- Practice spontaneity: Create space for unplanned connections and relationships
- Practice presence: Fully identify with the culture you're called to reach
- Practice powerlessness: Approach with humility and vulnerability, not power and control
- Practice prevenience: Recognize God's work already present and join with him
- Practice passion: Embrace redemptive suffering and feel the pain of the people
- Practice proclamation: Share the good news in ways that make sense to each context
- Organize around mission, not ministry
- Let church follow mission, not the other way around
- Contextualize the gospel for each generation and culture
- Romance the city: develop deep, loving relationships with culture

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we balance going out and going deep?** Both impulses are essential, but how do we maintain both without losing one or the other? How do we go out without losing depth, and go deep without losing the outward thrust?

**How far do we go in contextualization?** There are limits to how far we can go in identifying with culture. How do we discern when contextualization becomes syncretism? How do we maintain fidelity to the gospel while becoming native to culture?

**How do we create missional-incarnational communities in attractional contexts?** Most Western churches exist in contexts that expect attractional approaches. How do we transition from attractional to missional-incarnational without losing people or creating chaos?

**How do we measure missional-incarnational engagement?** Traditional metrics don't capture missional-incarnational engagement. How do we know when this impulse is present and when it is absent?

**How do we develop the six P's in practice?** Each of the six P's requires specific skills and practices. How do we develop these in individuals and communities?

**How do we create space for proximity, frequency, and spontaneity?** These require intentional choices and often conflict with busy schedules and programmatic thinking. How do we create space for them?

**How do we let church follow mission?** This requires a fundamental reorientation of how we understand church. How do we facilitate this transition?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to recover the missional-incarnational impulse in contemporary contexts.

This theme represents the essential dynamic that enables movements to engage authentically with culture. Without the missional-incarnational impulse, the church remains foreign to its context and loses its transformative power. With it, the church becomes native to its context and enables the gospel to take root and flourish in every culture.
