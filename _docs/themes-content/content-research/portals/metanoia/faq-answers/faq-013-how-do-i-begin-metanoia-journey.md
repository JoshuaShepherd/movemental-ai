# How Do I Begin the Metanoia Journey?

## Direct Answer

To begin the metanoia journey, start by recognizing that you need to unlearn as much as you need to learn. Face the reality that your current paradigms may be limiting your capacity for transformation. Be willing to have your mind blown by the ever-greater God. Engage the downcurve of the journey: **Unravel** by facing the wicked problems and adaptive challenges you're encountering, **Uncover** by sensing system flaws with "soft eyes"—perceiving what's really there rather than what you expect to see, **Unlock** by exploring new frontiers and possibilities, and **Understand** by gaining clarity on alternatives.

Then engage the upcurve: **Paradigm** by articulating a new organizational mind—new identity, story, and defining ideas, **Platform** by building culture and structures that support the new paradigm, and **Practices** by developing observable, repeatable behaviors that embody the transformation. Recognize that metanoia requires engaging mind, soul, and will—not just changing your thinking but also changing what you love and celebrate (culture), and changing what you actually do (practices). All three must be aligned for lasting transformation. Approach metanoia as a spiritual process, not just pragmatic change management. Pray, discern, and rely on the Holy Spirit.

## Expanded Explanation

The Metanoia Journey follows a U-shaped curve, involving both unlearning (the downcurve) and relearning (the upcurve). This journey follows the pattern of the hero's journey identified by Joseph Campbell—the quest, ordeal, and return that characterizes transformative experiences. Jesus' own life followed this pattern: incarnation (descent), ministry and passion (ordeal), resurrection and ascension (ascent). Metanoia enables us to participate in this pattern, bringing us in sync with the mind of Christ.

The downcurve consists of four stages:

1. **Unravel**: Face the wicked problems and adaptive challenges you're encountering. These are problems that can't be solved by applying existing expertise but require new learning, experimentation, and paradigm shifts.

2. **Uncover**: Sense system flaws with "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns and archetypal forms rather than just focusing on analytical details. See what's really there, not what you expect to see.

3. **Unlock**: Explore new frontiers and possibilities. Don't limit yourself to what you already know. Be open to new ways of thinking and operating.

4. **Understand**: Gain clarity on alternatives. See the options before you. Understand what's possible when you shift your paradigm.

The upcurve involves three stages:

1. **Paradigm**: Articulate a new organizational mind—new identity, story, and defining ideas. This is the organizational mind that shapes how you understand yourself and your purpose.

2. **Platform**: Build culture and structures that support the new paradigm. This is the organizational soul—culture and structures that shape collective behavior.

3. **Practices**: Develop observable, repeatable behaviors that embody the transformation. This is the organizational will—what you actually do, not just what you think or feel.

Wholehearted metanoia requires the integration of mind, soul, and will. The biblical understanding of "heart" encompasses all three dimensions: **mind-power** (paradigm shift, new ways of thinking), **soul-power** (culture and values, what we love and celebrate), and **will-power** (strategic action, what we actually do). Lasting transformation requires engaging the whole person, both individually and collectively.

Metanoia is not merely pragmatic change management but a deeply spiritual process that requires prayer, discernment, and reliance on the Holy Spirit. There are powers and principalities—spiritual forces—that resist transformation and seek to maintain the status quo. Leaders engaging in metanoia must recognize this is not just a human battle but a spiritual one.

## Key Points

- **U-shaped journey**: Metanoia involves both unlearning (downcurve) and relearning (upcurve).

- **Four downcurve stages**: Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand.

- **Three upcurve stages**: Paradigm, Platform, Practices.

- **Wholehearted transformation**: Requires engaging mind, soul, and will—not just thinking but also feeling and acting.

- **Spiritual process**: Not just pragmatic change management but deeply spiritual, requiring prayer and discernment.

- **Hero's journey pattern**: Follows the quest, ordeal, and return pattern of transformative experiences.

- **Patience required**: Metanoia takes time. The journey involves going through the valley, not around it.

- **Christo-logic**: Thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ, seeing from God's perspective.

## Practical Application

Start by recognizing that you need to unlearn as much as you need to learn. Face the reality that your current paradigms may be limiting your capacity for transformation. Be willing to have your mind blown by the ever-greater God.

Engage the downcurve:
- **Unravel**: Face the wicked problems and adaptive challenges. Don't avoid them. Name them clearly.
- **Uncover**: Sense system flaws with "soft eyes." See what's really there, not what you expect to see.
- **Unlock**: Explore new frontiers and possibilities. Be open to new ways of thinking.
- **Understand**: Gain clarity on alternatives. See what's possible.

Then engage the upcurve:
- **Paradigm**: Articulate a new organizational mind. Define new identity, story, and defining ideas.
- **Platform**: Build culture and structures that support the new paradigm.
- **Practices**: Develop observable behaviors that embody the transformation.

Recognize that metanoia requires engaging mind, soul, and will. Don't just change your thinking; also change what you love and celebrate (culture), and change what you actually do (practices). All three must be aligned.

Practice Christo-logic—thinking formatted according to the pattern of Christ. See everything from God's perspective. Think holistically. Develop spiritual instinct. Discern what God is doing and join with him.

Approach metanoia as a spiritual process. Pray. Discern. Rely on the Holy Spirit. Recognize that there are spiritual forces that resist transformation.

Be patient. Metanoia takes time. The journey involves going through the valley, not around it. There's no shortcut to maturity.

## Examples

The discovery of germ theory required metanoia. Scientists had to unlearn the old paradigm (diseases caused by miasma) and learn a new one (diseases caused by germs). This paradigm shift led to more effective treatments and a dramatic drop in mortality.

Jesus' own life demonstrates metanoia. His incarnation represents the descent (downcurve), his ministry and passion represent the ordeal, and his resurrection and ascension represent the return with new power (upcurve).

Churches that have undergone metanoia show transformation at multiple levels. They've shifted their paradigm (how they think), changed their platform (culture and structures), and developed new practices (observable behaviors). The transformation is wholehearted—engaging mind, soul, and will.
