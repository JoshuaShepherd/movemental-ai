# How to Begin the Metanoia Journey

## Getting Started

### Where to Begin

Metanoia is the Greek word usually translated as "repentance" in English, but it carries far richer meaning than our reduced understanding of that term. Metanoia means a radical change of mind, an expanded reframing of reality, a paradigm shift that transforms how we see and understand everything. It involves breakthrough moments that transform perception, enabling us to see the world through fresh eyes and experience ongoing conversion.

The Metanoia Journey is not a quick fix or a program you can implement in a few months. It's a U-shaped transformation process that requires both unlearning (the downcurve) and relearning (the upcurve). This journey follows the pattern of the hero's journey—the quest, ordeal, and return that characterizes transformative experiences. Just as Jesus' own life followed this pattern (incarnation, ministry and passion, resurrection and ascension), so too must we descend into the valley before we can ascend to new peaks.

If you're reading this, you've likely recognized that your organization needs fundamental change, not just surface-level adjustments. You've probably tried technical solutions and found they don't address the deeper issues. The Metanoia Journey is designed for exactly this situation—when adaptive challenges require new learning, experimentation, and paradigm shifts.

### Prerequisites and Readiness Assessment

Before beginning the Metanoia Journey, honestly assess your readiness:

**Key questions to ask:**

- Are you facing a "wicked problem" that technical solutions can't solve?
- Are you willing to go through the difficult unlearning process (the downcurve)?
- Do you have leadership committed to this journey, not just interested in it?
- Are you ready to face the reality that this will take significant time?
- Will you resist the temptation to "jump the chasm" and avoid the hard work?

**What you need before starting:**

1. **A clear understanding of your wicked problem**—What specific challenge is driving you to seek transformation?
2. **Leadership commitment**—Key leaders must be committed to the full journey, not just parts of it
3. **Willingness to unlearn**—You must be ready to let go of old ways of thinking and operating
4. **Realistic expectations**—This is a long-term process, often taking 2-3 years minimum
5. **Spiritual readiness**—Recognize this is not just organizational change but spiritual transformation

### Initial Preparation Steps

1. **Name your wicked problem**—Clearly articulate the adaptive challenge you're facing
2. **Assess your current state**—Use tools like pre-mortem exercises to understand where you are
3. **Gather your core team**—Form a committed group of leaders who will journey together
4. **Pray together**—This is fundamentally a spiritual process requiring God's guidance
5. **Commit to the journey**—Understand this is a quest where everything important is at stake

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Unravel—Facing the Wicked Problem (Months 1-3)

The journey begins with honestly facing your adaptive challenge. This is not about identifying symptoms but about naming the systemic problem.

**What to do:**

- **Name your wicked problem**—What is the specific organizational dilemma that's extremely difficult to solve because of its complex and interconnected nature?
  - Is it an adapt-or-die scenario?
  - Or an opportunity to thrive in new ways?
  - What makes it "wicked" (complex, interconnected, no simple solution)?

- **Conduct a pre-mortem**—Imagine the future failure of your organization. Visualize the death and anticipate the failure, then figure out why and how it failed. What are you not doing that you should be doing? What are the warning signs?

- **Become aware of anomalies**—What "splinter in your mind" tells you something is missing or wrong? What doesn't fit with your current paradigm?

- **Take personal responsibility**—As leaders, are you willing to take personal responsibility for the current state and the journey out of it? If unable, are you willing to step aside and let others lead?

- **Resolve to unlearn**—Are you resolved to embark on the difficult journey of unlearning? This requires courage and self-insight.

**Key questions at the Unravel stage:**

- What does this crisis (or future crisis) reveal about the fragilities in our system?
- As leaders, are we willing to take personal responsibility for our leadership of it?
- Are we resolved to embark on the difficult journey of un/learning to get out of it?
- What is the wicked problem we are now facing?

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have clearly named your wicked problem, understand its threat and promise, and are committed to the unlearning journey ahead.

### Step 2: Uncover—Sensing System Flaws (Months 3-6)

Having faced the wicked problem, you now need to see your system with "soft eyes"—the ability to perceive deeper patterns rather than just analytical details.

**What to do:**

- **Develop soft eyes**—Learn to see the whole picture, not just details. Soft eyes enable you to:
  - See what is really there
  - Recognize underlying structures and connections
  - Perceive patterns that hard, analytical eyes miss
  - Look again and see as if for the first time

- **Sense anomalies**—What observations differ significantly from standard behaviors or expectations? What are these telling you about problems inherent in the system?

- **Feel the pain**—Experience lament—what mystics call "the gift of tears." When we cry, we engage both sides of the brain, and the mind opens to new possibilities. Corporate lament can be powerful for a community.

- **Identify meta-ideas**—What are the foundational concepts on which other principles are based? What cornerstone concepts can you name for your organization? These are the ideas that, if changed, would change everything.

- **Conduct force-field analysis**—For each mDNA element (if using Apostolic Genius framework), identify:
  - Driving forces (boosters) that enhance movement
  - Restraining forces (blockers) that inhibit movement
  - What would need to change for movement to happen?

- **Engage upstream processing**—If the river runs dry or is polluted, look upstream for the source. Untangle the knots in the system itself. Where have you drifted from God's original intent?

**Key questions at the Uncover stage:**

- Having gone through recent cultural upheaval, what anomalies have we uncovered?
- Where have we become aware of our unfaithfulness to God's design? How can we lament these?
- What are the meta-ideas (foundational concepts) on which other principles are based?
- What practices, habits, or aspects of organizational culture are blocking change? How can we change them?

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have identified system flaws, uncovered meta-ideas, and understand what's blocking transformation.

### Step 3: Unlock—Exploring New Frontiers (Months 6-9)

This stage involves becoming intrepid trailblazers in search of new frontiers, charting the way forward.

**What to do:**

- **Think like a beginner**—Deliberately put yourself out of your comfort zone. Think like a hacker—try to figure out the frailties in the system and crack the code.

- **Learn from opposites**—Engage with people who have different outlooks and cultures. Look at how other disciplines have resolved wicked problems.

- **Explore alternative ways**—Use childlike imagination to explore alternative ways of doing things. Sometimes answers come from entirely out of left field.

- **Cultivate a culture of learning**—Create openness to learning new ways. This involves prayer-filled exploration and spiritual receptivity.

- **Break bad habits**—What behavioral ruts do you always fall into? How do these bind you to outdated thinking and practices?

- **Study other organizations**—What organizations are facing similar challenges? How can you learn from them? Engage with them.

- **Question assumptions**—What core functions do you assume must be done a certain way? For instance, must worship always be communal singing? What would you change?

**Key questions at the Unlock stage:**

- What are some bad habits or behavioral ruts we always fall into?
- What other organizations are facing similar challenges? How can we learn from them?
- What core functions do we assume must be done a certain way? What would we change?
- How can we deliberately step out of our comfort zones?

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have explored alternatives, learned from others, and begun to see new possibilities.

### Step 4: Understand—Gaining Clarity (Months 9-12)

Toward the bottom of the downcurve, you should have gained sufficient self-awareness to name viable alternatives to your inherited ways.

**What to do:**

- **Gain comprehension of alternatives**—After extensive research, which organizations have resolved their wicked problems? How can you engage with them?

- **Articulate what movement is**—Can you articulate what a movement is, and how it might compare to your current organization? How does your organization compare?

- **Identify meta-ideas**—What possible meta-ideas are latent in your system, waiting to be activated? The elements of mDNA (if using that framework) are understood as primary meta-ideas, but there are others.

- **Compare paradigms**—What are specific thoughts and actions in your current organizational paradigm that either aid or hinder your organizational vision?

- **Sense the promise**—You should begin to sense the promise of movement and see some pointers to viable ways forward.

**Key questions at the Understand stage:**

- After extensive research, which organizations have resolved their wicked problems?
- Can we articulate what a movement is, and how it might compare to our organization?
- What are specific thoughts and actions in our current paradigm that aid or hinder our vision?
- What meta-ideas are latent in our system, waiting to be activated?

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have clarity on alternatives, understand what movement looks like, and can identify meta-ideas for your organization.

### Step 5: The Turning Point—The Moment of Insight (Month 12+)

Here you arrive at the bottom of the U-shaped curve. This is the point of nakedness and openness to God—precisely where God can impact you in a new way.

**What to do:**

- **Attune to the moment**—This is where insight into how to resolve the wicked problem is finally given. Make every effort to attune yourselves to this moment.

- **Recognize the elegant solution**—This is what we call "rectitude" or "fittingness"—the intuition that "this just feels so right" that you know it is from God. It's the moment of revelation, the breakthrough that cannot be unseen.

- **Experience wholehearted metanoia**—This metanoic moment should involve the whole heart (mind, soul, will), not just one dimension. It's a conversion experience.

- **Receive the organizational DNA**—You should recognize the ancient archetypal template of the church that is latent in the core of the faith, and it begins to express itself through you.

**What this looks like:**

For many organizations, the elegant solution presents itself in the form of church-as-movement—in terms of its identity, nature, purpose, and practices. This understanding is based on movemental expressions of church in the New Testament and throughout history.

Depending on your organization's nature and purpose, the elegant solution might be different. But if you see yourselves as a functioning expression of the kingdom of God, movemental characteristics will be present because it's the paradigm most consistent with Jesus' vision.

**How to know you've reached the turning point:** When you have that "aha!" moment—the elegant solution that makes complete sense and feels right. This is the metanoic moment that cannot be unseen.

### Step 6: Paradigm—Articulating the New Mind (Months 12-18)

The upcurve begins with articulating a new organizational paradigm—the organizational mind (identity, story, defining ideas).

**What to do:**

- **Formulate the paradigm**—Articulate your new organizational mind:
  - **Identity:** Who are we? What is our core identity?
  - **Story:** What is our story? How do we understand our purpose?
  - **Defining ideas:** What are the meta-ideas that will guide us?

- **Identify meta-ideas with high leverage**—These are foundational concepts that, if changed, would change everything. Examples from mDNA:
  - Jesus is Lord
  - Disciple-Making
  - Missional-Incarnational Impulse
  - APEST Culture
  - Organic Systems
  - Communitas

- **Name organizational DNA**—What is the DNA that will define every aspect of your organization going forward? This DNA will be fractalized throughout the system.

- **Create mental maps**—Develop new mental maps (meta-ideas, beliefs, competencies) that guide thinking and action.

- **Fractalize the DNA**—Ensure the paradigm is replicated throughout the organization, from center to edge.

**Key requirements for paradigm shift:**

- Leadership unity
- Apostolic imagination
- Perseverance
- Telling alternate stories
- Letting things die
- Seeing reality clearly

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have a clearly articulated paradigm, identified meta-ideas, and begun to fractalize the DNA throughout your organization.

### Step 7: Platform—Building Culture and Structures (Months 18-24)

Platform is the organizational soul—the culture and structures that shape collective behavior.

**What to do:**

- **Build culture components:**
  - **Theological distinctives:** What are your core theological commitments?
  - **Core values:** What do you value? (But remember: values must become practices)
  - **Shared vocabulary:** What language will you use?
  - **Heroes:** Who do you celebrate? What behaviors do you honor?
  - **Celebration of behavior:** How do you recognize and reward the right behaviors?
  - **Branding:** How do you communicate your identity?

- **Create movemental structures:**
  - **Relational structures:** How do people connect?
  - **Resource structures:** How do resources flow?
  - **Measurement structures:** What gets measured and rewarded?

- **Align culture and structures**—Culture and structures must be aligned for effective mission. Platforms architect organizational behavior through the path of least resistance.

- **Engage the soul**—This is about experiential spirituality, engaging the soul of the organization.

**Key principle:** Culture and structures must be aligned. If you want your church to be missional ("go to them"), but most of your "mission" is centered on an attractional mindset ("come to us"), the attractional forms will always undermine your capacity to "go."

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have built culture components, created movemental structures, and aligned them for mission.

### Step 8: Practices—Engaging the Will (Months 24-30)

Practices are the organizational will—the observable, repeatable behaviors that embody values and create culture.

**What to do:**

- **Move from values to practices**—Identify core values, then ask: "What action, if applied, will most consistently embody this core value?" Link actions closely to ordinary rhythms in life.

- **Develop movemental rhythms**—Create rhythms and algorithms that fractalize DNA throughout the organization.

- **Create tools:**
  - **Physical tools:** What tangible resources support your practices?
  - **Training tools:** How do you train people in practices?
  - **Communication tools:** How do you communicate and reinforce practices?

- **Develop habits and muscle memory**—Practices make transformation tangible and embodied. Habits and muscle memory enable ongoing learning and refinement.

- **Create algorithms**—Develop clear processes that determine how actions are performed throughout the organization.

**Key principle:** Tools shape people. You must carefully design tools to support your mission. Practices make metanoia tangible and embodied.

**How to know when to move forward:** When you have developed practices, created tools, and are seeing them embodied throughout your organization.

### Step 9: Ongoing Refinement and Multiplication (Ongoing)

The Metanoia Journey doesn't end—it becomes part of your organizational DNA, enabling ongoing adaptation and growth.

**What to do:**

- **Bake metanoia into DNA**—Ensure the process becomes part of how you operate, not a one-time event.

- **Continue the cycle**—As new challenges arise, repeat the process. Metanoia is ongoing conversion.

- **Measure and refine**—Regularly assess what's working and what needs adjustment.

- **Multiply the process**—Help other organizations or parts of your organization go through metanoia.

- **Maintain childlikeness**—Approach with wonder and curiosity rather than cynicism and certainty.

## Tools and Resources

- Be patient with process

## Troubleshooting

### What to Do When Things Go Wrong

**Common obstacles:**

1. **"We're stuck in the downcurve"**
   - **Solution:** This is normal. The downcurve is difficult. Don't rush it. Provide support. Remember: you must go down before you can go up.

2. **"We can't identify our wicked problem"**
   - **Solution:** Use pre-mortem exercise. Get outside perspective. Look for anomalies. What doesn't fit? What's causing pain?

3. **"We're trying to jump the chasm"**
   - **Solution:** You can't skip the downcurve. The unlearning is essential. Help people understand why the journey is necessary.

4. **"We reached the turning point but nothing changed"**
   - **Solution:** The turning point is just the beginning of the upcurve. You still need to build paradigm, platform, and practices. Don't stop at insight—implement.

5. **"Our paradigm isn't taking hold"**
   - **Solution:** Are you fractalizing it? Is leadership unified? Are you telling alternate stories? Are you letting old things die?

### How to Address Resistance

**Types of resistance:**

- **Intellectual resistance**—"This doesn't make sense"
  - Provide education
  - Use stories and examples
  - Be patient
  - Answer questions

- **Emotional resistance**—"This is too hard/scary"
  - Acknowledge feelings
  - Provide support
  - Move slowly
  - Create safety

- **Institutional resistance**—"Our systems won't allow this"
  - Identify what needs to change
  - Create new structures
  - Gradually transition
  - Get help if needed

- **Spiritual resistance**—Powers and principalities
  - Recognize spiritual warfare
  - Pray together
  - Seek God's power
  - Rely on the Spirit

### Course Correction Strategies

**When to pause and reassess:**

- If you've been stuck for 6+ months
- If there's significant conflict
- If key leaders are losing heart
- If you've lost sight of why you're doing this

**How to course correct:**

1. **Stop and pray**—Seek God's guidance
2. **Reassess honestly**—What's working? What's not?
3. **Get outside perspective**—Consultant, coach, or other organization
4. **Adjust approach**—Maybe focus on different stage or element
5. **Renew commitment**—Remember why you started
