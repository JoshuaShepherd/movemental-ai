# How Do I Transition From Institution to Movement?

## Direct Answer

To transition from institution to movement, begin by recognizing that the church is designed to be a movement, not just an organization. The challenge is to maintain movemental energy even as you create necessary structures—to be organized but not institutionalized. Start by shifting your paradigm from institution-centered to movement-centered thinking. Understand that movements operate through networks rather than hierarchies, through multiplication rather than addition, through release rather than control. Then shift your platform: change your culture and structures to support movement rather than just maintenance. Develop a culture that values sending, multiplication, and reproduction. Create structures that enable reproduction rather than just addition. Finally, develop practices that embody movement: focus on making disciples who make disciples, send people out, activate APEST throughout the Body, build organic systems, and create communitas through shared mission.

The transition requires embedding all six elements of movement DNA (mDNA): Jesus is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas. Work on all six simultaneously, as mDNA is systemic. Be patient, as transition takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Trust the Holy Spirit to do the work of transformation. Your job is to create conditions where movement can emerge.

## Expanded Explanation

The church's historical pattern has been movement → institution → movement. Movements begin with energy and purpose, but over time they institutionalize to sustain themselves. Institutions provide stability but often lose the dynamism that created them. The challenge is to maintain movemental energy even as we create necessary structures—to be organized but not institutionalized.

The starfish and spider metaphor illustrates the difference. A spider has a head (central control) and legs (dependent parts)—cut off the head and the spider dies. A starfish has a distributed nervous system—cut it in half and you get two starfish. Movements operate like starfish: they are decentralized, distributed, and can reproduce from any part.

Transition requires shifting at three levels:

**Paradigm (Organizational Mind)**: Shift from institution-centered to movement-centered thinking. Understand that:
- Movements operate through networks, not hierarchies
- Movements multiply, not just add
- Movements release, not control
- Movements reproduce, not just grow

**Platform (Organizational Soul)**: Change culture and structures. Develop:
- Culture that values sending, multiplication, and reproduction
- Structures that enable reproduction rather than just addition
- Systems that operate like living organisms rather than machines

**Practices (Organizational Will)**: Develop observable behaviors:
- Focus on making disciples who make disciples
- Send people out
- Activate APEST throughout the Body
- Build organic systems
- Create communitas through shared mission

The transition requires embedding all six elements of mDNA. All six must be present and working together for the system to activate. You can't pick and choose.

Transition takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time. Don't expect immediate results. Focus on being faithful in the practices, and trust that the Holy Spirit will do the work of transformation.

## Key Points

- **Organized but not institutionalized**: Maintain movemental energy even as you create necessary structures.

- **Starfish vs. spider**: Movements are decentralized and distributed, not hierarchical and centralized.

- **Three-level shift**: Paradigm, Platform, Practices—all three must be aligned.

- **All six mDNA elements**: Work on all six simultaneously. You can't pick and choose.

- **Patience required**: Transition takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds over time.

- **Network structures**: Movements operate through networks, not hierarchies.

- **Multiplication over addition**: Focus on multiplication rather than just addition.

- **Release over control**: Movements release rather than control.

## Practical Application

Begin by shifting your paradigm. Help people understand that the church is designed to be a movement, not just an organization. Teach about movements vs. institutions. Help people see the difference.

Shift your platform. Change culture and structures:
- Develop culture that values sending, multiplication, and reproduction
- Create structures that enable reproduction rather than just addition
- Build systems that operate like living organisms

Develop practices that embody movement:
- Focus on making disciples who make disciples
- Send people out
- Activate APEST throughout the Body
- Build organic systems
- Create communitas through shared mission

Embed all six mDNA elements. Work on all six simultaneously. Remember that mDNA is systemic—all six must be present and working together.

Build network structures. Create distributed leadership. Enable reproduction from any part. Don't centralize control.

Focus on multiplication. Shift from addition to multiplication thinking. Measure multiplication, not just addition.

Release rather than control. Trust the Holy Spirit. Release people to function in their gifting. Don't try to control everything.

Be patient. Transition takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates movement. They operated through networks, multiplied through relationships, and reproduced from any part. Despite having no buildings, no professional leadership, and no formal institutions, they grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries.

Contemporary churches that have transitioned to movements show similar patterns. They operate through networks, focus on multiplication, release rather than control, and maintain movemental energy even as they create necessary structures.

The Methodist movement under Wesley shows transition to movement. Wesley created structures (class meetings, societies, circuits) but maintained movemental energy. The movement multiplied through relationships and reproduced from any part.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Movements mean no structure"**: Movements need structure, but it's organic rather than institutional. The challenge is to be organized but not institutionalized.

**"Transition happens quickly"**: Transition takes time. Like a flywheel, momentum builds through consistent effort over time.

**"We can transition by adding programs"**: Transition requires systemic change, not just adding programs.

**"Movements are chaotic"**: Movements have structure, but it's organic rather than institutional.

**"We have to choose between movement and institution"**: The challenge is to maintain movemental energy even as you create necessary structures.
