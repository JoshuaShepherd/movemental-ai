# Multiplication and Reproduction: The Exponential Nature of Movements

## Theme Overview

Multiplication and reproduction represent the exponential nature of movements—their capacity to grow not through addition but through multiplication, creating exponential rather than linear expansion. This is not about cloning (duplicating the original) but about reproduction (passing on DNA while allowing for adaptation). Movements multiply when they have simple, reproducible DNA that can be easily transferred from person to person, from community to community, from generation to generation.

The distinction between reproduction and cloning is crucial. Reproduction passes on DNA while allowing for adaptation to local contexts. Cloning duplicates the original model, importing problems and limitations. Movements that reproduce thrive; movements that clone decline. Reproduction enables exponential growth; cloning enables only linear growth.

The gospel spreads like a virus—it captures us, and when we are infected, we in turn go on to "infect" others in our relational networks. This is what Roland Allen called "the spontaneous expansion of the church." The gospel, like all great ideas, is "sneezable"—it can be easily transferred from person to person, creating viral growth.

Simplicity is essential for multiplication. As the Forgotten Ways Handbook notes, "Reproducibility relates to the capacity of living systems to multiply through simple, reproducible mechanisms." If we are to recover latent Apostolic Genius, we must ask ourselves, "What is the irreducible minimum of the faith? What is too complex to reproduce?" We must eliminate the things that don't matter. Simplicity is a vital key to multiplication and to spontaneous expansion.

The Chinese underground church provides a powerful example. They grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years through multiplication. Their motto was "Every person a church planter, every church a church-planting church." This multiplication ethos, combined with simple, reproducible DNA, enabled exponential growth.

Multiplication requires a multiplication ethos—a sustained commitment to multiplication that is integrated into the very fabric of the community. This means thinking about "movement planting" rather than "church planting," creating a culture where multiplication is expected and celebrated, and ensuring that every unit is designed to reproduce.

Organic systems have an innate capacity to reproduce spontaneously and exponentially. When organic systems meet a genuine movement ethos that expresses itself in networked structures, if given the right conditions for reproducibility, then history is in the making. Multiplication is not something we add to movements; it's something that happens when movements have the right DNA and the right conditions.

The challenge is maintaining multiplication while avoiding institutionalization. As movements grow, there is a natural pull toward institutionalization, which kills multiplication. Movements must find ways to maintain their reproductive capacity even as they grow and create necessary structures.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of multiplication and reproduction appears throughout the corpus, receiving particular emphasis in works that explore how movements form and multiply.

**The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Throughout, the book shows how movements multiply through simple, reproducible DNA. It emphasizes that the gospel must be simple enough to be transferred from person to person, easily grasped by illiterate peasants, yet profound enough to transform entire cultures. The book shows how the Chinese underground church multiplied through simple, reproducible mechanisms.

**The Forgotten Ways Handbook** (2012, with Darryn Altclass): Chapter 6, "Organic Systems," develops multiplication and reproduction in depth. It emphasizes that "reproducibility relates to the capacity of living systems to multiply through simple, reproducible mechanisms." It shows how simplicity is essential for multiplication and how organic systems have an innate capacity to reproduce spontaneously and exponentially.

**The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim): Throughout, the book shows how apostolic ministry enables multiplication. It emphasizes that "without apostolic multiplication, growth remains additive and individualistic." It shows how the apostolic function maintains and develops scalable organization and multiplication.

**On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Throughout, the book shows how large churches can transition toward missional movements by adopting multiplication principles. It emphasizes that movements multiply through simple, reproducible DNA and that multiplication is essential for movements to form and multiply.

**The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Throughout, the book shows how distributed leadership enables multiplication. It emphasizes that starfish (movements) can reproduce from any part, while spiders (institutions) cannot. It shows how multiplication requires distributed intelligence and simple, reproducible structures.

**5Q** (2017): Throughout, the book shows how the fivefold framework enables multiplication. It emphasizes that scalable organization is a key function of the apostolic and that multiplication requires all five functions operating together.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: multiplication and reproduction are essential for movements. Movements must have simple, reproducible DNA that can be easily transferred, and they must create a multiplication ethos that enables exponential growth. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different contexts—from small missional communities to large churches, from local to translocal networks.

## Theological Foundations

The theme of multiplication and reproduction is deeply rooted in biblical theology, drawing from the creation mandate, the Great Commission, and the way God designed life to reproduce.

**The Creation Mandate**: God's first command to humanity was "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). This mandate applies not just to biological reproduction but to all of life—we are called to multiply God's image, God's kingdom, God's mission. Multiplication is not optional but essential to God's design.

**The Great Commission**: Jesus' final command was "Go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). This is a multiplication command—not just to add but to multiply, not just to reach but to reproduce. The commission calls for exponential growth, not linear growth.

**The Parable of the Sower**: Jesus' parable of the sower (Matthew 13) shows how the kingdom multiplies. The seed that falls on good soil produces a crop—"some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty" (Matthew 13:8). This is multiplication, not addition. The kingdom is designed to multiply exponentially.

**The Parable of the Mustard Seed**: Jesus' parable of the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32) shows how the kingdom starts small but multiplies exponentially. The smallest seed becomes the largest tree. This is the nature of multiplication—small beginnings, exponential results.

**The Parable of the Yeast**: Jesus' parable of the yeast (Matthew 13:33) shows how the kingdom multiplies through influence. A small amount of yeast leavens the whole batch. This is multiplication through reproduction, not addition through attraction.

**The Early Church**: The early church multiplied exponentially. Acts shows how the church grew from 120 to thousands in a matter of days, then spread throughout the Roman Empire. This multiplication happened through simple, reproducible DNA—the gospel message, shared practices, relational networks.

**The Body of Christ**: The metaphor of the body (1 Corinthians 12) shows how the church is designed to multiply. Each part has a function, and the whole body grows and multiplies. The body is designed for reproduction, not just maintenance.

This theological foundation underscores that multiplication and reproduction are not human inventions but divine design, rooted in the very nature of God's work in the world.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements that have had transformative impact have multiplied exponentially through simple, reproducible DNA.

**The Early Church**: The early church multiplied exponentially, growing from 120 to thousands in days, then spreading throughout the Roman Empire. This multiplication happened through simple, reproducible DNA—the gospel message, shared practices, relational networks. The simplicity of the message enabled its multiplication.

**The Chinese Underground Church**: The Chinese underground church grew from 2 million to 120 million in seventy years through multiplication. Their motto was "Every person a church planter, every church a church-planting church." This multiplication ethos, combined with simple, reproducible DNA, enabled exponential growth even under intense persecution.

**The Celtic Movement**: The Celtic movement that evangelized Western Europe multiplied through simple, reproducible practices. It used monastic communities as nodes in a network, enabling multiplication through reproduction rather than cloning. The simplicity of its approach enabled it to adapt to different contexts while maintaining core identity.

**The Moravians**: The Moravian movement multiplied exponentially, sending out more missionaries in the first twenty years than the rest of Protestantism had in two hundred years. The multiplication happened through simple, reproducible structures and a multiplication ethos that was integrated into the very fabric of the community.

**Contemporary Movements**: Contemporary movements that are experiencing transformation have discovered the power of multiplication. They have created simple, reproducible DNA, developed a multiplication ethos, and enabled exponential growth through reproduction rather than cloning.

Conversely, movements that have lost their reproductive capacity have declined. When movements become complex, when they require elaborate organization or extensive resources, when they focus on addition rather than multiplication, they lose their capacity for exponential growth.

The pattern is clear: movements that multiply thrive, movements that don't decline. Multiplication and reproduction are not optional but essential for movements to form and multiply.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the church faces significant challenges in maintaining multiplication. The pull toward addition (attractional growth) is strong, driven by the desire for control, the need for resources, and the pressure to maintain the status quo.

The contemporary application requires:

**Creating Multiplication Ethos**: Churches must create a multiplication ethos—a sustained commitment to multiplication that is integrated into the very fabric of the community. This means thinking about "movement planting" rather than "church planting," creating a culture where multiplication is expected and celebrated, and ensuring that every unit is designed to reproduce.

**Distilling to Reproducible DNA**: Churches must distill their message and practices to simple, reproducible DNA. This means asking, "What is the irreducible minimum? What is too complex to reproduce?" It means eliminating unnecessary complexity and focusing on what is essential for multiplication.

**Designing for Reproduction**: Churches must design for reproduction from the beginning. This means creating simple, reproducible structures, practices, and systems that can be easily transferred. It means thinking about multiplication in the stem cell of the church, not as an afterthought.

**Creating Simple Structures**: Organizations must create simple, reproducible structures that enable multiplication. Structures must be simple enough to be easily understood and replicated, yet robust enough to maintain coherence. They must support life and multiplication rather than obstruct it.

**Developing Reproducible Practices**: Churches must develop simple, reproducible practices that can be easily transferred. Practices must be simple enough for anyone to do, yet meaningful enough to transform. They must be memorable and conversational.

**Enabling Viral Growth**: Churches must enable viral growth—the "sneeze" of the gospel. This means creating environments where the gospel can be easily transferred from person to person, where people are "infected" and go on to "infect" others. It means trusting the relational networks rather than trying to control them.

**Maintaining Multiplication While Growing**: As movements grow, there is a natural pull toward institutionalization, which kills multiplication. Movements must find ways to maintain their reproductive capacity even as they grow and create necessary structures.

The contemporary application requires churches to resist the pull toward addition and instead embrace multiplication that enables exponential growth.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of multiplication and reproduction connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Biology**: The study of reproduction shows how DNA is passed on while allowing for adaptation. The work on genetics shows how simple DNA creates complex organisms. The work on evolution shows how reproduction enables adaptation and multiplication.

**Complexity Science**: The study of complex systems shows how simple rules can create exponential growth. The work on networks shows how distributed systems can multiply. The work on emergence shows how simple components can create complex wholes.

**Organizational Theory**: The study of organizations shows how multiplication enables exponential growth. The work on scalability shows how simple systems scale better than complex ones. The work on network organizations shows how distributed systems can multiply.

**Marketing/Memetics**: The study of how ideas spread shows how "sneezable" ideas spread like viruses. The work on "ideaviruses" (Seth Godin) shows how simple ideas can become epidemics. The work on memetics shows how ideas replicate and spread.

**Mathematics**: The study of exponential growth shows how multiplication creates exponential curves. The work on networks shows how exponential growth happens through connections. The work on fractals shows how patterns repeat at every scale.

**Theology**: The study of the kingdom shows how it multiplies exponentially. The work on the Great Commission shows how multiplication is essential. The work on the early church shows how simple, reproducible DNA enabled multiplication.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how multiplication and reproduction function as both spiritual reality and practical principle for exponential growth.

## Practical Implications

The theme of multiplication and reproduction has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must create a multiplication ethos, designing for reproduction from the beginning. This means creating simple, reproducible DNA, developing simple structures and practices, and enabling viral growth. Churches must resist the pull toward addition and instead embrace multiplication.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model multiplication, demonstrating how to create simple, reproducible systems that enable exponential growth. Leaders must create environments where multiplication can flourish, providing frameworks and practices that enable reproduction. Leaders must recognize that multiplication is not optional but essential.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to multiplication, learning to pass on DNA through relationships, stories, and practices. This means being a "church planter" in one's context, creating simple, reproducible practices, and enabling viral growth through relational networks.

**Specific Applications**:
- Create multiplication ethos ("Every person a church planter, every church a church-planting church")
- Distill to reproducible DNA
- Design for reproduction from the beginning
- Create simple, reproducible structures
- Develop simple, memorable practices
- Enable viral growth ("sneeze the gospel")
- Think "movement planting" rather than "church planting"
- Make multiplication a covenantal requirement
- Create culture of permission to multiply

- Focus on what is essential for multiplication
- Trust relational networks rather than trying to control them

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we create multiplication ethos?** Multiplication requires a sustained commitment, but how do we create it? How do we integrate multiplication into the very fabric of the community?

**How do we distill to reproducible DNA?** Reproduction requires simple DNA, but how do we know what is essential? How do we eliminate unnecessary complexity while maintaining depth?

**How do we design for reproduction?** Reproduction must be designed from the beginning, but how do we do this? How do we think about multiplication in the stem cell of the church?

**How do we maintain multiplication while growing?** As movements grow, there is a natural pull toward institutionalization. How do we maintain reproductive capacity even as we grow?

**How do we enable viral growth?** Viral growth requires "sneezable" DNA, but how do we create it? How do we trust relational networks rather than trying to control them?

**How do we avoid cloning?** Reproduction is different from cloning, but how do we ensure we're reproducing rather than cloning? How do we pass on DNA while allowing for adaptation?

**How do we measure multiplication?** Multiplication creates exponential growth, but how do we measure it? How do we know when we're multiplying rather than just adding?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to enable multiplication and reproduction in contemporary contexts.
