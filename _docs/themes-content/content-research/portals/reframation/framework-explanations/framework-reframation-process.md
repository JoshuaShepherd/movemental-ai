# The Reframation Process: Learning to See God, Gospel, and Culture Anew

## Framework Overview

Reframation is the process of putting new frames around our pictures of God, people, and mission. It represents a continual reframing of theology and gospel to resonate with contemporary culture while maintaining fidelity to the truth. The term plays on the Reformation motto "semper reformanda" (always reforming), reframing it as "semper reframanda" (always reframing).

The Reframation Process addresses what the authors call a "crisis of interpretation"—the profound disconnect between the spiritual longings of contemporary culture and the church's ability to communicate the gospel meaningfully. It recognizes that we have reduced God, story, and life to manageable, controllable dimensions, and that we need to recover the full, unreduced, unleashed story of God.

The process involves three key movements: recognizing reductions (how we've reduced God, story, and life), exploring human longings (understanding the universal search for God, meaning, and transcendence), and learning to see anew (developing the art of seeing God, gospel, and culture with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary).

Reframation is not about changing the gospel but about changing how we see and communicate it. It's about recovering wonder, mystery, and poetic language that can "steal past the watchful dragons" that guard human hearts. It recognizes that people are "looking for the right things in the wrong places" and that understanding their longings is essential for missional engagement.

## Component Parts

### Part 1: Recognizing Reductions

**The Eclipse of God**: How various cultural forces have obscured our perception of the divine without God actually moving away. Using Martin Buber's metaphor of a solar eclipse, the authors demonstrate how ideologies, materialism, and reductionist thinking have blocked our view of God's fullness.

**The Reduction of Story**: How the story of God has been reduced to something bland and lifeless—like "tofu" rather than the jarring, transformative "Warhead" experience it should be. The church has demythologized, demystified, and depoeticized the biblical narrative, removing mythic elements, eliminating mystery and wonder, and reducing poetic language to rational code.

**The Reduction of Life**: How reduced understandings of God and story result in a severely cramped, adventure-less existence. The church has become "civilized" and domesticated, settling for "second things" rather than the abundant life Jesus promised. This is "Grey Town"—a moralistic, therapeutic deism that lacks wonder, mystery, and authentic engagement with God.

**The Dungeoning of Perception**: How human perception has been "dungeoned" and darkened. We have closed ourselves up in cave-like hideouts, seeing only filtered glimpses of reality through narrow openings. This "darkening of the nous" (mind/perception) makes us unable to see what is right in front of us.

### Part 2: Exploring Human Longings

**Missional Anthropology**: Understanding the universal human experience of desire, longing, and restlessness. Even those who claim not to believe in God are searching for transcendence. Augustine's insight that humans are fundamentally lovers, defined by what we desire.

**Sehnsucht**: The German concept of an insatiable longing that points beyond itself to God. This is the "humming of unseen harps"—the universal experience of being "haunted by God" and unable to escape the fact that life is lived under the auspices of eternity.

**The Four Echoes of a Voice** (N.T. Wright): The universal longings that point to God:
- Longing for justice
- Thirst for spirituality
- Hunger for relationship
- Delight in beauty
- Plus the need for significance and meaning

**Keys to the Soul**: Every person offers "keys to their soul" through their beliefs, idols, and longings. Understanding these longings is essential for missional engagement, as people are "looking for the right things in the wrong places."

### Part 3: Learning to See Anew

**The Art of Seeing**: Developing the capacity to see God, gospel, and culture with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary. This involves adopting childlike eyes of wonder and humility, recognizing that "all I know is NOT all there is."

**The Genius of the AND**: An alternative to reductionist "either/or" thinking, emphasizing that truth is always mysterious and paradoxical. The foundational truths of Christianity (Trinity, Incarnation, predestination/free will) are inherently paradoxical and can only be known by holding contradictory aspects in tension.

**Three-Dimensional Gospel**: Recognizing that the gospel addresses different existential needs through different cultural frames:
- Western (guilt/innocence): Addresses guilt and need for forgiveness
- Eastern (honor/shame): Addresses shame and need for honor
- Southern (power/fear): Addresses fear and need for power

A "glocal" three-dimensional gospel addresses all three dimensions, recognizing that all three are now present in every Western context.

**The Great Reframation**: Through remystifying, repoeticizing, and remythologizing our faith:
- **Remystifying**: Recovering wonder and radical amazement, recognizing the mystery of God
- **Repoeticizing**: Using poetic and imaginative language that can "steal past the watchful dragons"
- **Remythologizing**: Recovering the unifying vision of reality that integrates reason and imagination

**Romancing the City**: The practice of developing deep, loving relationships with the culture we're called to reach. This involves:
- The art of paying attention (like Moses at the burning bush)
- The art of listening (learning what "good news" means to each context)
- The practice of "interpathy"—deep cross-cultural empathy

## System Dynamics

The Reframation Process works as an integrated system:

1. **Recognition precedes reframing**: We must first recognize how we've reduced God, story, and life before we can reframe them.

2. **Longings reveal truth**: Understanding human longings helps us see what people are really searching for and how the gospel addresses those longings.

3. **Seeing enables engagement**: Learning to see God, gospel, and culture anew enables authentic missional engagement.

4. **Paradox holds truth**: The "Genius of the AND" recognizes that truth is paradoxical and must be held in tension.

5. **Story precedes argument**: Stories allow truth to penetrate defenses that rational arguments cannot breach.

6. **Relationship precedes proclamation**: "Romancing the city" means developing deep relationships before proclaiming the gospel.

7. **Prevenience guides mission**: Recognizing that God is already at work long before we arrive enables us to join him there.

## Activation Principles

The Reframation Process activates when:

1. **Reductions are recognized**: We acknowledge how we've reduced God, story, and life.

2. **Longings are understood**: We explore the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence.

3. **Perception is cleansed**: We develop the art of seeing with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary.

4. **Paradox is embraced**: We hold contradictory aspects of truth in tension rather than reducing to either/or.

5. **Story is recovered**: We remystify, repoeticize, and remythologize our faith.

6. **Relationship is prioritized**: We "romance the city" through deep, loving relationships.

7. **Prevenience is recognized**: We look for what God is already doing and join him there.

What blocks activation:
- **Reductionist thinking**: Insisting on either/or rather than both/and
- **Rationalism**: Eliminating mystery, wonder, and poetic language
- **Cultural isolation**: Remaining foreign to culture rather than becoming native
- **Formulaic approaches**: Using one-size-fits-all methods rather than contextual engagement
- **Lack of wonder**: Losing the capacity for radical amazement
- **Fear of paradox**: Inability to hold contradictory aspects of truth in tension

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess if the Reframation Process is present and functioning:

1. **Evaluate reductions**: Have we recognized how we've reduced God, story, and life?

2. **Assess longings**: Do we understand the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence?

3. **Check perception**: Are we seeing with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary?

4. **Examine paradox**: Are we holding contradictory aspects of truth in tension?

5. **Look for story**: Are we using stories, poetry, and imagination to communicate truth?

6. **Assess relationships**: Are we "romancing the city" through deep, loving relationships?

Key questions:
- Have we recognized our reductions of God, story, and life?
- Do we understand what people are really searching for?
- Are we seeing with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred?
- Are we holding paradox in tension?
- Are we using stories and poetry to communicate truth?
- Are we developing deep relationships before proclaiming?

## Implementation Pathways

To implement the Reframation Process in your church or organization:

1. **Recognize reductions**: Acknowledge how you've reduced God, story, and life. Explore the eclipse of God, the reduction of story, and the reduction of life.

2. **Explore longings**: Study the universal human search for God, meaning, and transcendence. Understand the four echoes of a voice and how people are "looking for the right things in the wrong places."

3. **Develop the art of seeing**: Practice seeing with "soft eyes" that recognize the sacred in the ordinary. Adopt childlike eyes of wonder and humility.

4. **Embrace paradox**: Learn to hold contradictory aspects of truth in tension. Practice the "Genius of the AND" rather than either/or thinking.

5. **Recover story**: Remystify, repoeticize, and remythologize your faith. Use stories, poetry, and imagination to communicate truth.

6. **Romance the city**: Develop deep, loving relationships with the culture you're called to reach. Practice the art of paying attention, listening, and interpathy.

7. **Recognize prevenience**: Look for what God is already doing and join him there.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Recognize reductions and explore longings
- Perception: Develop the art of seeing with soft eyes
- Communication: Recover story, poetry, and imagination
- Engagement: Romance the city through deep relationships
- Integration: Hold paradox in tension and recognize prevenience

## Case Studies and Examples

**The Camino Pilgrims**: Mark's journey on the Camino de Santiago revealed a profound disconnect between the spiritual longings of contemporary culture and the church's ability to communicate the gospel meaningfully.

**Burning Man**: Alan's experiences at Burning Man revealed how people are searching for transcendence, meaning, and community, yet the church struggles to recognize and respond to these longings.

**John Smith and Linda**: The story of John meeting Linda in a strip club demonstrates finding what God is already doing and joining him there, recognizing prevenient grace.

**Paul in Athens**: Acts 17 provides a model for cultural exegesis, showing how Paul engaged with the city's idols, philosophy, and poetry to unlock their ultimate desires.

**Jesus and the Samaritan Woman**: John 4 demonstrates uncovering the sacred artifacts in each person's soul, understanding their longings and connecting them to the gospel.

**C.S. Lewis and Chronicles of Narnia**: An example of "stealing past the watchful dragons" through stories that allow truth to penetrate defenses that rational arguments cannot breach.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Reductionist thinking**: Insisting on either/or rather than both/and, reducing truth to manageable dimensions.

2. **Rationalism**: Eliminating mystery, wonder, and poetic language in favor of rational code.

3. **Cultural isolation**: Remaining foreign to culture rather than becoming native, maintaining distance rather than proximity.

4. **Formulaic approaches**: Using one-size-fits-all methods rather than contextual engagement.

5. **Lack of wonder**: Losing the capacity for radical amazement and childlike eyes.

6. **Fear of paradox**: Inability to hold contradictory aspects of truth in tension.

7. **Ignoring prevenience**: Not recognizing what God is already doing in culture.

8. **Surface-level engagement**: Engaging culture superficially rather than going deep.

## Evolution and Development

The Reframation Process has evolved through:

**Early Development**: First introduced in *Reframation* (2020, with Mark Nelson) as a comprehensive framework for learning to see God, gospel, and culture anew.

**Integration**: The process has been integrated with:
- Missional-Incarnational Impulse (as the way we engage culture)
- The Art of Seeing (as the capacity to recognize the sacred)
- Romancing the City (as the practice of deep cultural engagement)

The understanding continues to develop as the framework is applied in diverse contexts and as connections to other frameworks are explored.
