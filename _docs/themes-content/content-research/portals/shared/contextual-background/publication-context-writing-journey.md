# Publication Context: The Writing Journey and Publication Timeline

## Context Overview

The body of work spans more than two decades (2003-2024) and represents a journey of discovery, development, and deepening understanding. Understanding the publication context—when works were written, what challenges they addressed, and how they relate to each other—helps us see how concepts developed over time and how different works serve different purposes in the overall corpus.

This context matters because it reveals that the work represents an ongoing conversation, not a static set of ideas. Concepts develop, deepen, and integrate across publications. Understanding the publication timeline helps us see how early works established foundations, middle works expanded and refined concepts, and later works integrated and applied frameworks. It also helps us understand the cultural moment each work addressed and how the work evolved in response to changing contexts and deepening understanding.

### The Relationship Between Works

**Foundation Works**: *The Shaping of Things to Come* and *The Forgotten Ways* establish the foundational frameworks and questions.

**Development Works**: *ReJesus*, *Untamed*, *The Permanent Revolution*, and *5Q* develop and expand core concepts.

**Application Works**: *Right Here, Right Now*, *On the Verge*, *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*, and *Fast Forward to Mission* focus on practical application.

**Integration Works**: *Reframation* and *Metanoia* integrate concepts and provide frameworks for transformation.

**Specialized Works**: *Disciplism* and *The Faith of Leap* address specific gaps or themes.

### The Co-Authoring Pattern

The work includes both solo-authored and co-authored works:

**Solo-Authored**: *The Forgotten Ways*, *Disciplism*, *5Q*, *Fast Forward to Mission*

**Co-Authored**: Most works are co-authored, bringing different perspectives and expertise:
- Michael Frost: *The Shaping of Things to Come*, *ReJesus*, *The Faith of Leap*
- Debra Hirsch: *Untamed*
- Lance Ford: *Right Here, Right Now*, *The Starfish and the Spirit*
- Dave Ferguson: *On the Verge*
