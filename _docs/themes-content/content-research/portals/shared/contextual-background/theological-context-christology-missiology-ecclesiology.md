# Theological Context: Christology, Missiology, and Ecclesiology

## Context Overview

A foundational theological principle that runs throughout the work is the relationship between Christology (our understanding of Christ), missiology (our understanding of mission), and ecclesiology (our understanding of the church). The principle is clear: **Christology determines missiology, which determines ecclesiology**. We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right, and we cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

This context matters because it reveals why so many attempts at church renewal fail—they try to fix the church (ecclesiology) without first recalibrating around Jesus (Christology) and mission (missiology). Understanding this theological relationship helps us see that authentic church reform must begin with rediscovering the person of Jesus, which then shapes our understanding of mission, which in turn determines how we structure and live as church.

## Detailed Contextual Information

### The Theological Sequence

**Christology → Missiology → Ecclesiology**

This sequence is not arbitrary but reflects the logical and theological order of how these dimensions relate:

1. **Christology (Who is Jesus?)**: Our understanding of Jesus—his person, nature, mission, and message—forms the foundation for everything else. If we get Jesus wrong, everything that follows will be wrong.

2. **Missiology (What is mission?)**: Our understanding of mission flows from our understanding of Jesus. If Jesus is the sent one (the missionary), then the church exists as a sent people (missionary). Mission is not an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative, rooted in God's purposes.

3. **Ecclesiology (What is the church?)**: Our understanding of the church is determined by our understanding of mission. If mission is about being sent into the world, then the church must be structured and organized for that sending, not for maintenance or attraction.

### The Problem: Reversed Sequence

Much of contemporary Christianity has reversed this sequence, starting with ecclesiology (what the church should be) and working backward. This creates several problems:

**Institutional Focus**: When we start with ecclesiology, we tend to focus on institutional forms—buildings, programs, structures—rather than on the person of Jesus and his mission.

**Maintenance Mindset**: Starting with ecclesiology often leads to a maintenance mindset—how do we keep the church going?—rather than a missional mindset—how do we join God's mission in the world?

**Programmatic Solutions**: Reversed sequence leads to programmatic thinking—what programs will fix the church?—rather than asking what Jesus is doing and how we join him.

**Attractional Approach**: When ecclesiology comes first, the church becomes attractional—how do we get people to come to us?—rather than missional—how do we go to them?

### The Solution: Recalibrating Around Jesus

*ReJesus* (2009) develops the call to "reJesus" the church—to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Jesus Reveals God**: We cannot deduce anything about Jesus from what we think we know about God; we must deduce everything about God from what we do know about Jesus. Jesus changes our understanding of divinity, not the reverse.

2. **Jesus Shapes Mission**: Understanding who Jesus is and what he came to do shapes our understanding of mission. Jesus was sent by the Father, and the church exists as a sent people, continuing Jesus' mission in the world.

3. **Jesus Determines Church**: The church exists to extend Jesus' ministry to the world. How we understand Jesus determines how we structure and live as church.

### The Shema Schema

*ReJesus* develops the "Shema Schema"—a framework for understanding how the Great Commandment (the Shema) shapes discipleship and mission:

**Love God** (Deuteronomy 6:5): "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might."

**Love Neighbor** (Leviticus 19:18): "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."

This schema reveals that:
- Discipleship is about wholehearted love for God (heart, soul, mind, strength)
- Mission flows from this love—we love our neighbors because we love God
- The church exists to form people in this love and send them in mission

### The Missio Dei Foundation

The theological foundation for mission is the *missio Dei*—the sending of God. Mission is not primarily something the church does but something God does, and the church participates in God's mission.

**Key Theological Points**:

1. **God is a Missionary God**: The Father sends the Son, the Father and Son send the Spirit, and the Triune God sends the church. Mission is rooted in the very nature of God.

2. **Mission Precedes the Church**: Mission is not an activity of the church but the reason for the church's existence. The church exists because of mission, not the reverse.

3. **The Church is Sent**: The church is inherently missional—it exists as a sent people, continuing the mission of Jesus in the world.

4. **Incarnation as Model**: The incarnation demonstrates how mission is done—God becomes one of us, taking on flesh and dwelling among us. The church must do the same—become native to contexts rather than remaining foreign.

### The Ecclesiological Implications

When we get Christology and missiology right, ecclesiology follows:

**The Church is Missional**: If mission flows from understanding Jesus, then the church must be structured for mission, not for maintenance. The church exists to be sent, not to attract.

**The Church is Incarnational**: If Jesus became one of us, then the church must become native to its contexts, engaging culture deeply rather than remaining separate.

**The Church is Apostolic**: If Jesus was sent by the Father, then the church exists as a sent people, with apostolic (sent) DNA encoded in its very being.

**The Church is a Movement**: If mission is about going into the world, then the church must be organized as a movement—mobile, adaptable, reproducible—rather than as an institution.

**The Church is a Disciple-Making Community**: If Jesus made disciples, then the church's primary task is making disciples who can make disciples, not running programs or maintaining structures.

## Connection to Core Content

This theological context directly informs core concepts:

**Jesus is Lord**: The centrality of Christology establishes "Jesus is Lord" as the foundational confession. Everything flows from understanding who Jesus is.

**Apostolic Genius**: The relationship between Christology, missiology, and ecclesiology is encoded in Apostolic Genius. Getting Jesus right enables getting mission right, which enables getting church right.

**Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: The missio Dei foundation and incarnation model directly inform the missional-incarnational impulse. Mission flows from God's nature, and incarnation shows how it's done.

**Discipleship**: The Shema Schema reveals that discipleship is about wholehearted love for God, which then flows into love for neighbor. This shapes understanding of authentic discipleship.

**Movement Dynamics**: When ecclesiology flows from missiology, which flows from Christology, the church naturally organizes as a movement rather than an institution.

**APEST Culture**: The fivefold functions exist to extend Jesus' ministry to the world. Understanding Jesus (Christology) reveals what ministry looks like, which shapes how the church functions (ecclesiology).

**ReJesus**: The call to recalibrate around Jesus is the solution to the problem of reversed sequence. We must start with Jesus, not with church structures or programs.

## Relevance for Today

This theological context matters now because:

**It Reveals the Root Problem**: Many churches are trying to fix symptoms (decline, lack of engagement) without addressing the root cause—getting Jesus wrong, which leads to getting mission wrong, which leads to getting church wrong.

**It Provides the Solution**: The solution is not better programs or strategies but recalibrating around Jesus. When we get Jesus right, mission and church follow.

**It Challenges Assumptions**: This theological sequence challenges our assumptions about what the church is and what it's for. The church exists for mission, not for itself.

**It Offers Clarity**: Understanding this sequence provides clarity about priorities. We must start with Jesus, not with church structures or programs.

**It Connects to Movement**: When we get the sequence right, the church naturally organizes as a movement rather than an institution, because movement is what mission requires.

**It Shapes Discipleship**: Understanding the Shema Schema shapes how we understand discipleship—it's about wholehearted love for God that flows into love for neighbor and mission.
