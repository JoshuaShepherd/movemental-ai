## 1. Early Church Stories

### Story: The Early Church Growth (25,000 to 20 Million)

**Type:** Historical Movement  
**Category:** Movement Expansion

**Summary:**
The early Christian movement grew from as few as 25,000 Christians in AD 100 to up to 20,000,000 by AD 310—a growth rate of approximately 40% per decade. This remarkable expansion occurred despite persecution, lack of buildings, incomplete Scriptures, no formal institution, and no professional leadership.

**Full Narrative:**
"How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?" This question launched Alan's quest to discover Apostolic Genius. The early church had none of the things we would ordinarily employ to solve the problems of the church: no church buildings (only converted houses), no complete Scriptures (they were putting the canon together), no formal institution or professional leadership, no seeker-sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands, seminaries, or commentaries. They actually made it hard to join the church—by the late second century, aspiring converts had to undergo a significant initiation period. Yet they grew exponentially.

**Key Details:**
- AD 100: as few as 25,000 Christians
- AD 310: up to 20,000,000 Christians
- Growth rate: approximately 40% per decade
- Illegal religion throughout this period
- No church buildings (only converted houses)
- Scriptures not yet complete
- No formal institution or professional leadership
- Rigorous initiation process for converts

**Context:**
This story illustrates the power of Apostolic Genius and mDNA. It demonstrates that movements can thrive without the resources we typically consider essential. The persecution actually purified the movement, forcing it to distill to essentials.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Introduction
- **Section:** Opening question and historical context
- **First Appearance:** Introduction, page 5-6
- **Subsequent Appearances:** Referenced throughout as primary example of Apostolic Genius

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Apostolic Genius, mDNA, movement dynamics, organic systems
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** The six elements of mDNA working together
- **Themes Addressed:** Persecution as catalyst, simplicity, multiplication
- **Key Principles:** Movements don't require institutional resources; persecution can activate latent potential

**Usage Notes:**
This story is used as the foundational example throughout The Forgotten Ways. It's the primary historical mirror against which contemporary church is compared. The story demonstrates that what we consider essential may actually be non-essential, and that persecution can be a gift that activates Apostolic Genius.

- Methodist Movement Story (similar growth patterns)
- Pentecostal Movement Story (contemporary parallel)

### Story: The Underground Church Catechumen Process

**Type:** Historical Movement  
**Category:** Discipleship Practice

**Summary:**
The early church developed rigorous catechumen processes requiring significant initiation periods. Proposed converts could lose their lives, and the community had to be certain they were worthy before allowing them to join the baptized community.

**Full Narrative:**
The underground Christian movement had developed what it called the catechumen process. These involved rigorous personal examinations that required the catechumen to prove they were worthy of joining the confessing community. Not only could proposed converts lose their life, because of the persecution they faced, but the community had to be certain they should be allowed to become part of the Christian community in the first place. This was contrary to the "seeker-sensitive" practice so prevalent in our day.

**Key Details:**
- Rigorous personal examinations
- Significant initiation period required
- Life-threatening commitment
- Community discernment process
- Contrast to seeker-sensitive approaches

**Context:**
This story illustrates the early church's commitment to rigorous discipleship and the high cost of following Jesus. It contrasts with contemporary approaches that lower barriers to entry.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Chapter 5, "Disciple Making"
- **Section:** Discussion of early church discipleship practices

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Disciple-making, cost of discipleship, community discernment
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** mDNA element of disciple-making
- **Themes Addressed:** Rigorous discipleship, persecution, community formation
- **Key Principles:** Discipleship requires commitment; lowering the bar weakens the movement

**Usage Notes:**
Used to critique contemporary seeker-sensitive approaches and to demonstrate that movements require high commitment, not low barriers.

**Cross-References:**
- Chinese Underground Church (similar rigorous processes)
- Contemporary discipleship practices (contrast)

## 2. Chinese Underground Church Stories

### Story: Chinese Church Growth Under Persecution (2 Million to 120 Million)

**Type:** Historical Movement  
**Category:** Movement Expansion Under Persecution

**Summary:**
When Mao Tse-tung took power and initiated the systemic purge of religion from China, the church, which had been dependent on Western forms due to colonization, was estimated to number about two million. Foreign missionaries and ministers were expelled, church property was nationalized, most senior church leaders were killed or imprisoned, and Christianity was explicitly targeted for obliteration. When the Bamboo Curtain lifted in the early 1980s, Christianity had flourished beyond all imagination, growing to an estimated 80-120 million.

**Full Narrative:**
Mao Tse-tung took power and initiated the systemic purge of religion from China. The church, which had been dependent on Western forms due to colonization, was estimated to number about two million. The Communists expelled all foreign missionaries and ministers, nationalized all church property, killed most of the senior church leaders, either killed or imprisoned second and third tier leaders, and then proceeded to perpetrate one of the cruelest persecutions in history. The explicit aim of the Cultural Revolution was to obliterate Christianity from China.

When Western observers were allowed back into China in the early 1980s, after the death of Mao and the subsequent lifting of the so-called Bamboo Curtain, they expected to find the church decimated. Instead, they discovered that Christianity had flourished beyond all imagination. The estimates then were that the church had grown to around 30-50 million. The latest research estimates the number to be around 80-120 million, and it has grown significantly since then.

**Key Details:**
- Starting point: ~2 million Christians (1949)
- Ending point: 80-120 million (estimates vary, latest research)
- Time period: ~65-70 years
- Context: Severe persecution, Cultural Revolution
- No buildings, no central organization, no mass meetings
- Growth occurred underground, in house churches

**Context:**
This story serves as the primary contemporary example of Apostolic Genius, parallel to the early church. It demonstrates that movements can thrive under the most severe persecution and that removing institutional supports can actually activate latent movement DNA.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Introduction
- **Section:** Primary contemporary example
- **First Appearance:** Introduction, pages 6-7
- **Subsequent Appearances:** Referenced throughout as parallel to early church

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Apostolic Genius, mDNA, persecution as catalyst, organic systems
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** All six mDNA elements working together
- **Themes Addressed:** Persecution, simplicity, multiplication, indigenous leadership
- **Key Principles:** Persecution can activate latent potential; movements don't need institutions

**Usage Notes:**
Used as the primary contemporary proof that Apostolic Genius is not just historical but can be activated today. Often paired with the early church story to show the pattern across radically different contexts.

**Cross-References:**

## 3. Celtic Missionary Stories

### Story: The Cell and the Coracle

**Type:** Historical Movement  
**Category:** Movement Rhythms

**Summary:**
The Celtic movement had a slogan: "the cell and the coracle." The "cell" refers to the place of contemplative prayer where monks spent time alone before God and in community worship. The "coracle" describes a round, keelless boat used for missionary journeys. About four Celts would get into these little boats, pray "Lord of the wind and the waves, take us your servants to where you will," then push out into the ocean, allowing the tides to sweep them to unknown shores where they would preach the gospel.

**Full Narrative:**
The conversion and subsequent mission of Patrick to the Irish peoples started one of the most remarkable movements in the history of the church, a movement destined to "save civilization" and embed the gospel in the West. One of the slogans of this remarkable movement was "the cell and the coracle." This strange phrase actually refers to the two central aspects/rhythms of the Celtic movement.

The "cell" refers to the place of contemplative prayer—where the monks and nuns spent time alone before God as well as in community worship. The notion of the cell as central to the life of the Irish monastics captures well the profound commitment to intimacy with God that was reflected in their leaders of the movement (Patrick, Aidan, Brendan, etc.).

The "coracle," on the other hand, describes a round, keelless, flatbottomed boat made from woven wood covered in skins or canvas and waterproofed with tar. While it was expected that all members of the movement have a rich life of worship and prayer—as would be presumed with monastics—it was also expected that all would be involved in the mission to evangelize Ireland, Britain, and Europe.

One of the bravest things the Celts did was something we, in our culture of fear, would probably call plain foolhardy. About four of them would get into these little boats where they would pray something like this: "Lord of the wind and the waves, take us your servants to where you will." Then, trusting themselves to the sovereign God and his desire to redeem all peoples, they would push out into the ocean, allowing the tides to sweep them up and, hopefully, to land them on some shore where they would then proceed to preach the gospel to the people there! Talk about the faith of leap! With such zealous devotion and commitment to God and his mission, no wonder the Celtic Movement is credited with evangelizing Western Europe during the Dark Ages.

**Key Details:**
- Slogan: "the cell and the coracle"
- Cell: contemplative prayer, intimacy with God
- Coracle: round, keelless boat for missionary journeys
- Practice: Four people in a boat, prayer for guidance, trust in God's sovereignty
- Leaders: Patrick, Aidan, Brendan
- Impact: Evangelized Western Europe during Dark Ages
- Movement: Credited with "saving civilization"

**Context:**
This story illustrates the rhythm of contemplation and mission, the balance between being and doing, between intimacy with God and engagement with the world. It demonstrates radical trust in God's sovereignty and willingness to take risks for the gospel.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Faith of Leap
- **Chapter:** Chapter 4, "The Hero's Journey"
- **Section:** Opening story about Celtic movement

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Liminality, communitas, missional-incarnational impulse, risk and adventure
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** Balance of contemplation and mission
- **Themes Addressed:** Adventure, trust, sovereignty of God, radical mission
- **Key Principles:** Mission requires risk; contemplation fuels mission; trust God's guidance

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate the hero's journey pattern and to demonstrate that mission requires both deep intimacy with God (cell) and radical engagement with the world (coracle). Shows the balance needed in missional movements.

The Methodist movement, founded by John Wesley in eighteenth-century England, grew so rapidly that by Wesley's lifetime, one in thirty English men and women had become Methodists. In America, the movement claimed the allegiance of 34 percent of the population.

**Full Narrative:**
Take, for instance, the Methodist movement, which was founded in eighteenth-century England by John Wesley. After his own conversion experience and his subsequent "heart strangely warmed" encounter with God, Wesley began to travel throughout Great Britain with a vision for the renewal of the church. He "sought no less than the recovery of the truth, life and power of earliest Christianity." By the time of his death, one in thirty people in Britain had become Methodist, and the movement had spread to America, where it claimed the allegiance of 34 percent of the population.

**Key Details:**
- Founder: John Wesley
- Time: 18th century
- Location: Great Britain, then America
- Growth: One in thirty English by Wesley's death
- America: 34% of population
- Vision: Recovery of earliest Christianity

### Story: Methodist Decline - The Loss of Movement DNA

**Type:** Historical Movement  
**Category:** Movement Decline

**Summary:**
Methodism declined when it lost its movemental DNA. Tired of being derided as "uncouth" by Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Methodist leadership required ministers to complete four years of ordination studies. Discipleship (classes and bands) became an optional extra, and the movement lost its dynamism.

**Full Narrative:**
This cause declined when the movement lost its ethos of evangelism and disciple making and degenerated into mere religious maintenance. In fact, although Methodism in America had experienced massive expansion, sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke discovered that critical "movement killers" were introduced into Methodism in America that led to its decline. Tired of the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians deriding them as "uncouth" and not knowing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, the Methodist leadership decided that the circuit riders should do rigorous seminary training at least equal to that of their antagonists. Under this barrage of insults, the Methodist leadership decided that the circuit riders should do rigorous seminary training. Ministers had to complete fours years of ordination studies in order to qualify. Classes and bands—discipleship had become an optional extra. Methodism lost its movemental energy.

**Key Details:**
- Cause of decline: Loss of movemental DNA
- Specific change: Required seminary training for ministers
- Result: Discipleship became optional
- Impact: Movement lost dynamism
- Research: Rodney Stark and Roger Finke study

**Context:**
This story illustrates how movements decline when they lose their essential DNA. It demonstrates that institutionalization (seminary training, professionalization) can kill movemental energy.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways, The Permanent Revolution
- **Chapter:** The Forgotten Ways, Chapter 5; The Permanent Revolution, Chapter 4
- **Section:** Discussion of movement decline

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Movement decline, institutionalization, loss of mDNA
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** What happens when mDNA elements are lost
