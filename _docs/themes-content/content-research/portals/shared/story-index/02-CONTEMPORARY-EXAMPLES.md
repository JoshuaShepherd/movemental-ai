## 1. Contemporary Church Examples

### Story: Church Multiplication Associates (CMA)

**Type:** Contemporary Movement  
**Category:** Movement Example

**Summary:**
Church Multiplication Associates (CMA) is a movement that started in the United States and now has churches in sixteen countries around the world. In a decade, it grew to more than ten thousand churches. The movement demonstrates all six elements of mDNA working together.

**Full Narrative:**
To ground this irritatingly intangible idea in a contemporary Western example, let me point to Church Multiplication Associates (CMA). CMA is a movement that started in the United States but now has churches in sixteen countries around the world. Don't let this rather unassuming name fool you—this movement, which in a decade grew to more than ten thousand churches, is a living example of Apostolic Genius in action. Neil Cole, the founder of this movement, says that the story of CMA begins with his story of being a pastor in Southern California. This soft-spoken man has a real heart for the unevangelized, which led him deeper and deeper into thinking about more genuinely missional ways of being church. With a real gift for organic thinking and an uncanny ability to see things organically, he set about planting a missional movement.

Starting a single church was not an option for us; we would settle for nothing less than a movement. We were willing to abandon anything, even successful ones that would hold us back from that goal. I have found that multiplication is always preceded by simplification. We were willing to abandon anything that would not multiply indigenous churches.

With these fighting words, Church Multiplication Associates was born in 1999, and it has been growing ever since, driven by a recovery of ancient impulses inherent in the gospel of Jesus Christ itself.

Throughout the movement, one can find a simple yet profound affirmation and experience of the lordship of Jesus. In response to the claims of Jesus as Lord and Savior, the movement emphasizes discipleship and disciple making as foundational to everything. They developed Life Transformation Groups (LTGs), which form the basic structure for the entire movement. As already mentioned, they are masterful at designing the entire movement around the various organic metaphors found in Scripture itself. In CMA there is a definite missional-incarnational impulse—they are "doing church" in just about every conceivable social context—from parking lots to cafés, pubs to houses. And they do not control through hierarchy but network each group through empowering coaching relationships. They have an explicit commitment to an APEST approach to ministry and leadership. You will find mission-oriented communities that are fluid, adaptive, adventure based, and formed in the context of a common purpose that lies outside itself—what will be described as liminality and communitas.

## 3. Contemporary Context Examples

### Story: Forge Internship Program

**Type:** Contemporary Practice  
**Category:** Leadership Development

**Summary:**
Forge hosts an internship that places interns in an environment requiring missional engagement. The intern meets at least weekly with a coach who debriefs them, identifies problems, suggests actions, and refers them to resources. The training is done by missional practitioners, not just academics.

**Full Narrative:**
At Forge Mission Training Network, we have tried to develop a form of action-learning discipleship. Our twin aims are to develop missionaries to the West and to form missional leaders. To do this we host an internship that places the intern in an environment requiring missional engagement. We do this because when people are placed in a situation requiring something beyond their current capacity, they are forced to learn. It's called jumping in at the deep end. Most of the interns' learning happens in the context of real missional engagement. The intern meets at least weekly with the coach, who debriefs them, identifies problems, suggests actions, and refers them to resources, including books and conferences. We do use information, but this information is communicated only by those who have demonstrated missional competency. We use missional practitioners to teach. Engaging in training in this way, the intern learns in the context of real engagement, and the learning sticks because it is immediately applicable to them. Mission is, and always was, the mother of good theology.

**Key Details:**
- Organization: Forge Mission Training Network
- Program: Internship
- Approach: Action-learning discipleship
- Method: Place in missional environment, weekly coaching
- Teachers: Missional practitioners, not just academics
- Principle: Mission is the mother of good theology
