## 1. Alan's Personal Stories

### Story: The Question That Launched the Quest

**Type:** Personal Journey  
**Category:** Origin Story

**Summary:**
About four years prior to releasing the first edition of The Forgotten Ways, Alan attended a seminar on missional church where the speaker asked: "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?" and "And how many do you think there were when Constantine came on the scene, say, AD 310?" The answers (25,000 and 20,000,000) and the follow-up question—"How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?"—haunted Alan and launched his quest to discover Apostolic Genius.

**Full Narrative:**
About four years prior to releasing the first edition I attended a seminar on missional church where in making a point the speaker asked a question: "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?" He then asked: "And how many do you think there were when Constantine came on the scene, say, AD 310?" Here are the somewhat surprising answers:

- AD 100: as few as 25,000 Christians
- AD 310: up to 20,000,000 Christians

He then asked the question that has haunted me to this day: "How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?"

It was as if God was calling me to dedicate myself to finding the answer. It was a quest to understanding what it is that could produce such amazing growth and impact. I wanted to apply my findings for the church in any other time and place, including of course the twenty-first century. I totally dedicated myself to the task. This quest led me to discover a generative system that undergirds all genuine, highly transformative expressions of church, which I call movement DNA, or mDNA for short.

**Key Details:**
- Time: About four years before first edition of The Forgotten Ways
- Context: Seminar on missional church
- Question: How did early church grow from 25,000 to 20 million?
- Impact: Launched Alan's quest
- Result: Discovery of mDNA and Apostolic Genius

**Context:**
This is the origin story of The Forgotten Ways and Alan's discovery of Apostolic Genius. It demonstrates how a single question can launch a life-changing quest.

### Story: South Melbourne Restoration Community - The Shift from Communitas to Community

**Type:** Personal Experience  
**Category:** Church Leadership Experience

**Summary:**
Alan's experience leading South Melbourne Restoration Community taught him about the difference between communitas and community. Initially, the community was focused, sharp, and missional, experiencing communitas. But as they became more stable and comfortable, something shifted. They gained stability but lost the missional edge, shifting from "the community for the world" to "the community for me."

**Full Narrative:**
The explorations of these questions took on a very personal form in my own experience as leader of South Melbourne Restoration Community, the story of which I have told in section 1 of this book. In the early dynamics of that vibrant community, especially as it was still forming, we experienced communitas in a very natural, instinctive way. All we did was set out to build a community that was radically committed to Jesus and to his mission in our world. And communitas happened. It was exciting—the community was focused and sharpened by a common purpose that lay beyond itself. We experienced a wonderful kind of way. We were missional, even though at the time this was as yet an undefined term for us. We experienced a form of community.

But something shifted as we became more stable. While we gained a lot from becoming a more established ecclesia, something significant was inadvertently lost as the church culture changed and became more comfortable. I came to the conclusion that there must be something about middle-class culture that eventually erodes the liminal edge and replaces communitas with consumeristic community. In other words, our own middle-class culture can function like an anti-missional virus.

Operating under the influence of these "bugs" in our middle-class software, we found ourselves operating more and more like a vendor of religious goods and services, vying for the attention of discerning spiritual consumers. Flattered by the attention, we more or less followed the "gather and amuse" impulse implicit in church-growth thinking. We got more transfers from other churches, but the flow of new converts from the world slowed to a trickle. We became busier than ever, but with less and less real missional impact. We shifted from "the community for the world" to the more consumptive "the community for me," and along fundamentally missional lines, and this was not achieved without pain and conflict.

**Key Details:**
- Church: South Melbourne Restoration Community
- Role: Alan as leader
- Initial state: Communitas, missional, focused
- Shift: Became stable, comfortable, consumeristic
- Loss: Missional edge, communitas
- Gain: Stability, transfers from other churches
- Insight: Middle-class culture can function as anti-missional virus

**Context:**
This story illustrates the tension between communitas and community, and how movements can lose their edge when they become comfortable. It demonstrates the "anti-missional virus" of middle-class culture.

### Story: Alan's Training as a Marketer and Advertiser

**Type:** Personal Background  
**Category:** Personal History

**Summary:**
Alan was trained as a marketer and advertiser before coming to Christ. This background gives him insight into the power of consumerism and how it functions as a competing religion. He recognizes that marketers are now deliberately stepping into the void that was left by the decline of traditional religion.

**Full Narrative:**
I was trained as a marketer and advertiser before I came to Christ, and when I look at the power of consumerism and of the market in our lives, I have little doubt that consumerism is now the dominant religion of the West. If the role of religion is to offer a sense of identity, purpose, meaning, and belonging, then consumerism meets all these criteria. Because of the competitive nature of the market, advertisers deliberately co-opt religious ideas and religious symbols in order to sell their products. Marketers are the high priests of this new religion, and the use of religious symbols and rituals merely serves to bolster advertising's appeal to our deepest longings.

It seems to me that advertisers are now deliberately stepping into the void that was left by the decline of traditional religion. Astute cultural commentator Douglas Rushkoff, in his PBS documentary The Persuaders, notes that marketers are now learning from religion in order to sell products. Marketers have now discovered that people will buy products because they know that religion offers the ultimate object of desire—transformation, community, meaning, identity, and purpose. If marketers can just link their products to this great unfilled void, they will sell.

**Key Details:**
- Background: Trained as marketer and advertiser before coming to Christ
- Insight: Consumerism is the dominant religion of the West
- Recognition: Marketers function as high priests of consumerism
- Understanding: How consumerism co-opts religious symbols and longings

### Story: The Mission Project That Revealed Consumerism

**Type:** Personal Experience  
**Category:** Learning Moment

**Summary:**
Alan initiated a significant mission project in his church that required stronger commitment from community members. As leadership, they intentionally focused on making disciples, but they had inadvertently cultivated the very consumerism they were trying to address. This was a moment of truth: if we don't disciple people, the culture surely will.

**Full Narrative:**
But this is no mere objective and cold analysis; I have applied this critique to my own experience. I remember from section 1 my experience initiating a significant mission project that required stronger commitment from the community members. As a leadership we had intentionally focusing on making disciples, we had inadvertently cultivated the very consumerism we were trying to address. We got more transfers from other churches, but the flow of new converts from the world slowed to a trickle. This was a moment of truth for me: if we don't disciple people, the culture surely will. This was a moment of truth and that our practice must change and that somehow disciple making must become a central priority.

**Key Details:**
- Context: Mission project requiring stronger commitment
- Intention: Making disciples
- Reality: Inadvertently cultivated consumerism
- Result: More transfers, fewer new converts
- Learning: If we don't disciple people, culture will
- Impact: Realization that practice must change

**Context:**
This story illustrates how even well-intentioned efforts can inadvertently cultivate consumerism. It demonstrates the importance of rigorous discipleship and the reality that culture will disciple people if the church doesn't.

**Source Information:**
- **Book:** The Forgotten Ways
- **Chapter:** Chapter 5, "Disciple Making"
- **Section:** Discussion of consumerism in church

**Conceptual Connections:**
- **Concepts Illustrated:** Consumerism, discipleship, unintended consequences
- **Frameworks Demonstrated:** How consumerism infiltrates church
- **Themes Addressed:** Discipleship, consumerism, church culture
- **Key Principles:** Culture will disciple if church doesn't; good intentions aren't enough

**Usage Notes:**
Used to illustrate how consumerism can infiltrate even well-intentioned churches and to demonstrate the critical importance of intentional discipleship.

### Story: Mark Nelson's Camino de Santiago Pilgrimage

**Type:** Personal Experience (Co-author)  
**Category:** Spiritual Journey

**Summary:**
Mark Nelson walked across Spain over 28 days with his 23-year-old son, hiking over 450 miles to complete the Camino de Santiago. He met hundreds of pilgrims, and discovered that when he tried to explain his vocation as a pastor, people couldn't connect his spirituality with their own search for God, beauty, truth, or justice.

**Full Narrative:**
Two summers ago, I (Mark) walked across Spain: over a period of twenty-eight days, my twenty-three-year-old son and I hiked over 450 miles through countryside and city, plateaus and mountains to complete a spiritual pilgrimage called the Camino de Santiago. Over 250,000 "pilgrims" walk at least a portion of the Camino every year. For me, this was both a spiritual journey as well as a sabbatical from my busy day-to-day life as a pastor.

On our journey we met, walked, ate meals, and stayed in hostels with hundreds of different people. It was a genuine pleasure (in most instances) to meet and learn about each person. It took only a day or two of being on the trail to come to the conclusion that every initial conversation with other "pilgrims" always began with some variation of the following two questions: "Where did you start walking?" and "Why are you walking?" After those initial conversation starters, the discussion usually expanded to a broad range of topics, including the inevitable questions about home, family, and vocation.

I still remember the first time I tried to explain what I do in life, a life spent in vocational ministry for at least the last thirty years.

"So, what does that mean … you're like … a priest?" "No, not exactly. I lead, teach, and take care of people in a faith community in the heart of the city that gathers once a week and tries to live out what they believe about Jesus throughout their whole lives." "So, yeah, you're a priest." And that was that. They had found their category for me.

Being outed as a "priest" always seemed to kill the conversation from that point on. For these pilgrims on the Camino, somehow my vocation as a "priest" had little to do with their own search for God, beauty, truth, or justice. Their notion of what constituted a spiritual life clearly had no place for people like me in it, and their spirituality had no way of viably engaging with, or interpreting, mine or any other form of Christianity they had ever seen represented.

This was somewhat alarming to me because I considered myself a decidedly spiritual person, but I apparently had no meaningful way to communicate any overt Christian understandings of God with the people I met on the Camino. Yet I felt like each and every one of us "pilgrims" on our way to Santiago de Compostela was searching for something.

### Story: Alan and Deb's Burning Man Experiences

**Type:** Personal Experience  
**Category:** Cultural Engagement

**Summary:**
For the past ten years, Alan and Deb have made regular pilgrimages to Burning Man, which Alan describes as one of the most explicit spiritual quests in current Western culture. Every year around 70,000 people descend on Black Rock Desert, Nevada. The event is a gift economy, involves radical self-reliance and self-expression, and climaxes with the burning of "The Man" and "The Temple."

**Full Narrative:**
For the past ten years or so, I (Alan) and my wife, Deb, have made a regular pilgrimage of a somewhat different nature. While hardly being as overtly religious as the Way of St. James, the Burning Man gathering remains, in my opinion, one of the most explicit spiritual quests in current Western culture. Every year around 70,000 people from every walk of life descend on one of the most remote and desolate places in Black Rock Desert, Nevada: an ancient dried-up lake bed called Black Rock City, or simply "The Playa" by the "Burners" themselves.

While the die-hard Burners insist that things are changing and the gathering is becoming way too mainstream, by far the majority of participants are there not simply to party. Instead, they view the whole experience as something of a personal pilgrimage. For some this involves a whole year of preparation and planning.

In many ways far more energetically spiritual than the average church service, the real religious quest behind Burning Man is not at all hard to discern: conversations about God, spirit, meaning, love, and beauty are everywhere present and encouraged. And not only is Burning Man a celebration of some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen, it is also what is called a "gift economy." It is an incredibly generous place where nothing is for sale and everything can be given. In fact, everyone is expected to bring something to share with others, be it a piece of art, an act of service, an idea, music, dance, or simply a meal or a libation shared with random people walking past your tent. Collectively, Burners end up donating tens of millions of dollars by sharing some of the most magnificent artwork ever seen. Remarkably, many of these art pieces will be burned during the week to signify that art cannot be possessed by the wealthy; it is to be experienced equally by all and then relinquished—itself quite a statement in the obsessively acquisitive world we all inhabit.

Participants are encouraged to experience radical self-reliance where each Burner brings everything they need for the event, as well as radical self-expression—each individual is at liberty to express themselves in whatever way they see fit. Because all are accepted for who they are, or as who they present themselves to be, Burning Man is somewhat of a celebration of human creativity, with people dressing in some of the most original costumes seen anywhere. It is weird, wild, and intriguingly wonderful.

The week climaxes with two major experiences, which define the whole event: the first is the burning of "The Man" on the Saturday night. The Man is a huge, fifty-foot, cruciform statue, symbolically situated at the very center of the camp, and it functions as the reference point for the week, hence the festival's name. The second major event, the burning of "The Temple"—itself a magnificent structure that any wealthy art collector would probably pay many millions of dollars to own—exemplifies the deeply spiritual nature of the Burn. During the week, the Temple is the designated place where people "do business with God" (or the "Universe," the "Universal Spirit," the "True Self," or whatever). They mourn the loss of friends that year, make restitution, or bring something—a shrine or some other symbol—that represents an event that is significant for them.

Burners can write poems or prayers on the walls, or construct a little personal shrine to remember a loved one or a broken relationship—it's a very special place and people treat it with reverence.

Whereas the burning of the Man releases what can only be called Dionysian energies—it is a wild party that goes all night—the burning of the Temple on the Sunday night is a completely different affair. Over 70,000 people gather together in reverent silence. Then, at sundown, the temple is lit on fire, and the stunningly beautiful, fire-dyed flames consume the building. At this point people begin to openly weep, wail, and mourn. As misdirected as much of this seems to be to a Christian, it is nonetheless an incredibly sacred, genuinely "religious" moment where the whole city opens itself to "otherness," to God, to others, to their own suffering, to the affirmation of life, and to the yearning for forgiveness.

**Key Details:**
- Participants: Alan and Deb Hirsch
- Frequency: Regular pilgrimages for past 10 years
- Location: Black Rock Desert, Nevada
- Attendance: ~70,000 people annually
