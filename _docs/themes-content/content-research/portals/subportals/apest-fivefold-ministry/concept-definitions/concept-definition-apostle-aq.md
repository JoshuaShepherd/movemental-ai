# Apostle (AQ): Pioneering Intelligence

## The Essential Definition

Apostle (Apostolic Intelligence or AQ) is the pioneering form of organizational intelligence that extends the church into new contexts, multiplies communities, and architects systems for movement. The apostolic function is essential for missional movements—there has never been a missional movement with transformational impact that did not have active apostolic ministry. Apostles are the pioneers, the movement architects, the ones who extend the church beyond its current boundaries.

## The Full Explanation

The apostolic function is perhaps the most misunderstood and most essential of the fivefold functions. In the Western church, apostles have been largely "exiled"—either ignored entirely or reduced to a historical category (the twelve apostles). But the apostolic function is not just for the first century; it's essential for every generation of the church.

Apostolic intelligence (AQ) is the pioneering form of organizational intelligence. Apostles are:
- **Pioneers**: They go first, breaking new ground, extending into new contexts
- **Architects**: They design systems and structures for movement
- **Multipliers**: They focus on reproduction and multiplication, not just addition
- **Mobilizers**: They activate and deploy people for mission
- **Movement Catalysts**: They create the conditions for movement to emerge

The apostolic function is essential for missional movements because movements require someone to go first, to break new ground, to extend beyond current boundaries. Without apostolic ministry, the church becomes static, unable to adapt to new contexts or engage missionally.

Apostles are not just church planters, though they often plant churches. They are movement architects who design systems for multiplication. They think in terms of networks, reproduction, and exponential growth. They focus on extending the church into new contexts, not just maintaining existing ones.

The apostolic function is often misunderstood because it's been exiled for so long. Many people think apostles are just the original twelve, or that apostolic ministry is about authority and hierarchy. But true apostolic ministry is about pioneering, extending, and multiplying—it's about movement.

## Biblical Foundations

The word "apostle" comes from the Greek "apostolos," meaning "one who is sent." In the New Testament, apostles are those sent by Christ to extend his mission. The twelve apostles were foundational, but the New Testament also speaks of other apostles, including Paul, Barnabas, and others.

Ephesians 4:11 lists apostles first among the gifts Christ gives to his church, suggesting their foundational importance. The apostolic function is about extending, multiplying, and architecting systems for movement.

## Historical Development

The concept has been developed across multiple publications:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 8, "APEST Culture"
- *The Permanent Revolution* (2012, with Tim Catchim): Comprehensive treatment
- *5Q* (2017): Expansion to apostolic intelligence
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Application to large churches

## Theological Significance

Apostolic intelligence matters because movements require pioneers. Without apostles, the church cannot extend beyond its current boundaries or adapt to new contexts. The apostolic function is essential for missional engagement.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding apostolic intelligence means:
1. Recognizing the need for pioneers
2. Creating space for apostolic ministry
3. Supporting apostolic initiatives
4. Thinking in terms of multiplication, not just addition
5. Designing systems for movement
6. Extending into new contexts

## Interconnections

Apostolic intelligence connects to all other mDNA elements and is essential for missional movements.
