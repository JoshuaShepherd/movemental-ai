# Evangelist (EQ): Recruiting Intelligence

## The Essential Definition

Evangelist (Evangelistic Intelligence or EQ) is the recruiting form of organizational intelligence that gathers people, proclaims the good news, and connects people to the cause of Christ. Evangelists are the recruiters, the gatherers, the ones who bring people into the movement. The evangelistic function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can effectively communicate the good news and gather others to the cause.

## The Full Explanation

Evangelistic intelligence (EQ) is the recruiting form of organizational intelligence. Evangelists are:
- **Recruiters**: They gather people to the cause
- **Proclaimers**: They communicate the good news effectively
- **Connectors**: They connect people to Jesus and to the community
- **Gatherers**: They bring people together around the mission
- **Storytellers**: They tell the story in compelling ways

The evangelistic function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can effectively communicate and gather. Without evangelists, the movement cannot grow or extend its reach.

Evangelists are often misunderstood because evangelism has been reduced to techniques or programs. But true evangelistic intelligence is about authentically communicating the good news and gathering people to the cause. It's about connection, not just conversion.

## Biblical Foundations

The evangelistic function is evident throughout Scripture, from Jesus' own ministry to the early church's expansion. Evangelists are those who effectively communicate the good news and gather people to the cause.

## Historical Development

The concept has been developed across multiple publications, emphasizing the importance of the evangelistic function for movements.

## Theological Significance

Evangelistic intelligence matters because movements need to grow. Without evangelists, the movement cannot extend its reach or gather new people. The evangelistic function is essential for multiplication.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding evangelistic intelligence means:
1. Valuing the evangelistic function
2. Creating space for evangelistic ministry
3. Supporting evangelistic initiatives
4. Communicating the good news effectively
5. Gathering people to the cause
