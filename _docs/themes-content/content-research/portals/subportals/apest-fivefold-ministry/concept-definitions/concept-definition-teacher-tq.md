# Teacher (TQ): Grounding Intelligence

## The Essential Definition

Teacher (Teaching Intelligence or TQ) is the grounding form of organizational intelligence that explains truth, equips people, systematizes knowledge, and preserves truth. Teachers are the explainers, the equippers, the ones who help people understand and apply truth. The teaching function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can ground the community in truth and equip them for mission.

## The Full Explanation

Teaching intelligence (TQ) is the grounding form of organizational intelligence. Teachers are:
- **Explainers**: They explain truth in ways people can understand
- **Equippers**: They equip people for mission and ministry
- **Systematizers**: They organize and systematize knowledge
- **Preservers**: They preserve truth and tradition
- **Grounders**: They ground the community in truth

The teaching function is essential for missional movements because movements need people who can ground the community in truth and equip them for mission. Without teachers, the movement cannot maintain its foundation or equip its people.

Teachers are often the most recognized function in the Western church, but they're often reduced to preaching or education. True teaching intelligence is about grounding people in truth and equipping them for mission.

## Biblical Foundations

The teaching function is evident throughout Scripture, from the Old Testament emphasis on instruction to Jesus as teacher to the New Testament emphasis on teaching and equipping. Teachers explain, equip, and ground people in truth.

## Theological Significance

1. Valuing the teaching function
