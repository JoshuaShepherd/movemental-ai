# APEST Function Relationships: The Fivefold Intelligence Working Together

## Overview

APEST represents the fivefold ministry framework from Ephesians 4:11—Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds (Pastors), and Teachers. But these are not merely separate leadership roles; they are five forms of intelligence (5Q) that work together as an integrated system. Understanding how these functions relate to one another is essential, because the church needs all five operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.

Each function brings unique perspectives, capabilities, and contributions. But when isolated, each function also brings limitations and blind spots. The functions are designed to complement, balance, and enhance one another. This map explores the relationships, dependencies, complementarity, and integration patterns that make APEST function as an integrated system.

**Why These Connections Matter:** The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. Understanding relationships helps recover what's been lost and integrate all five functions.

**How to Use This Map:** Use this map to understand why your church might lack certain capacities, to see how functions complement each other, to identify which functions are missing or weak, and to develop strategies for integrating all five functions into your community's life.

## Relationship Descriptions

### 1. Apostles and Prophets: The Foundational Partnership

**The Relationship:** Apostles and prophets form a foundational partnership that provides the foundation upon which the church is built (Ephesians 2:20). This is not just a biblical designation but a practical reality in movements throughout history.

**How They Connect:**
- **Generative Partnership:** Both are generative forms of ministry—apostles generate new forms of doing, prophets generate new forms of thinking. Both raise uncomfortable questions about the status quo, though for different reasons.
- **Missional-Incarnational Balance:** Apostles drive the missional impulse (going out), prophets drive the incarnational impulse (going deep). Together, they provide breadth and depth—the warp and woof of mission.
- **Accountability and Guidance:** Prophets provide the necessary intelligence to guide apostolic decision-making, direction, and design. They call apostolic entrepreneurialism away from pragmatism toward true faithfulness.
- **Vision and Execution:** Prophets sense the gap between God's vision and reality, calling for faithfulness. Apostles are intolerant of passivity in the face of mission, working to close the gap that prophets intuit.

**Nature of Relationship:** Complementary and foundational. Apostles need prophets to keep them grounded in God's reality and faithful to God's purposes. Prophets need apostles to extend the vision beyond critique to transformative action.

**Key Insight:** Apostles without prophets can become pragmatic and unfaithful. Prophets without apostles can become critical without transformation. Together, they provide the foundation for movement.

### 2. Apostles and Evangelists: Growth and Extension Partners

**The Relationship:** Apostles and evangelists are both growth-oriented, but they differ in motivation, outcome, and organizational design. Understanding these differences is crucial, because they are often confused.

**How They Connect:**
- **Different Motivations:** Apostles extend Christianity as a whole—they are custodians of the DNA of the church, advancing the cause as an integrated faith system. Evangelists recruit individuals to the cause—they catalyze faith in Jesus and gain new adherents.
- **Different Outcomes:** Apostles catalyze movement primarily through mission and church planting (multiplication). Evangelists create church growth by adding people through conversions (addition).
- **Different Designs:** Evangelistic leadership tends to design systems that transfer the message en masse and incorporate additional converts (centripetal—drawing in). Apostolic leadership designs to mobilize converts into ongoing mission and extend the church's reach (centrifugal—sending out).
- **Complementary Functions:** Both are needed to avoid the "iron law of involution"—the tendency of movements to recoil back on themselves without growth. Apostles prevent involution through multiplication, evangelists through addition.

**Nature of Relationship:** Complementary but distinct. They work together to ensure growth, but their approaches are different—one multiplies communities, the other adds people. Both are needed for sustainable movement.

**Key Insight:** Confusing apostles and evangelists (calling evangelistic leaders "apostolic") diminishes the impact of both. Understanding their differences allows both to function at full capacity.

### 3. Prophets and Shepherds: Depth and Care Partners

**The Relationship:** Prophets and shepherds both care deeply about the welfare of God's people, but from different angles—prophets through challenging to faithfulness, shepherds through nurturing and protection.

**How They Connect:**
- **Depth Focus:** Both are concerned with going deep—prophets into God's purposes and justice, shepherds into people's lives and needs.
- **Justice and Compassion:** Prophets call for covenant faithfulness and justice in systems and structures. Shepherds provide compassion and care in relationships and community.
- **Challenge and Comfort:** Prophets challenge people to live faithfully, sometimes uncomfortably. Shepherds comfort and nurture, creating safe spaces. Both are needed—challenge without comfort can be harsh, comfort without challenge can be enabling.
- **Incarnational Mission:** Both support incarnational mission—prophets through deep cultural engagement and justice, shepherds through caring presence in neighborhoods and contexts.

**Nature of Relationship:** Complementary tensions. They balance each other—prophets ensure faithfulness isn't compromised for comfort, shepherds ensure challenge doesn't become harshness.

**Key Insight:** A church with only prophets becomes harsh and disconnected. A church with only shepherds becomes comfortable and unfaithful. Together, they create communities that are both faithful and caring.

### 4. Teachers and Apostles: Stability and Innovation Partners

**The Relationship:** Teachers and apostles represent the tension between stability and innovation—teachers preserve and systematize truth, apostles pioneer and extend into new territory.

**How They Connect:**
- **Preservation and Extension:** Teachers preserve truth, systematize understanding, and ground people in foundational beliefs. Apostles extend into new contexts, adapt truth to situations, and pioneer new expressions.
- **System and Movement:** Teachers create stable systems that can be trusted and built upon. Apostles create movement that can adapt and extend. Both are needed—systems without movement become rigid, movement without systems becomes chaotic.
- **Foundational Truth:** Teachers ensure apostles don't innovate away from core truth. Apostles ensure teachers don't systematize truth into irrelevance.
- **Wisdom and Mission:** Teachers develop wisdom from accumulated knowledge. Apostles develop mission from pressing opportunities. Together, they ensure mission is grounded and wisdom is active.

**Nature of Relationship:** Tension and balance. They pull in different directions, but this tension is healthy—it prevents both stagnation and chaos.

**Key Insight:** Movements need both teachers (for grounding) and apostles (for extension). Too much teacher leads to stasis, too much apostle leads to instability. Together, they create grounded movement.

### 5. Evangelists and Shepherds: Recruitment and Retention Partners

**The Relationship:** Evangelists recruit people to the cause, shepherds retain and nurture them in the community. They work together to ensure both addition and retention.

**How They Connect:**
- **Recruitment and Retention:** Evangelists excel at gathering people, creating interest, and connecting people to the cause. Shepherds excel at integrating people, creating belonging, and developing people over time.
- **Entry and Formation:** Evangelists create on-ramps and entry points. Shepherds create pathways for formation and growth. Together, they ensure both access and development.
- **Excitement and Stability:** Evangelists generate excitement and momentum around the cause. Shepherds provide stability and continuity for long-term growth. Both are needed—excitement without stability burns out, stability without excitement stagnates.
- **Public and Private:** Evangelists operate more publicly, gathering crowds and proclaiming good news. Shepherds operate more privately, caring for individuals and small groups. Both are needed for healthy community.

**Nature of Relationship:** Sequential and complementary. Evangelists bring people in, shepherds help them stay and grow. They work in sequence but also complement each other's work.

**Key Insight:** A church strong in evangelism but weak in shepherding loses people as fast as it gains them. A church strong in shepherding but weak in evangelism becomes insular. Both are needed for sustainable growth.

### 6. Teachers and Prophets: Truth and Faithfulness Partners

**The Relationship:** Teachers and prophets both care deeply about truth, but approach it differently—teachers systematize and explain truth, prophets challenge and call to faithfulness to truth.

**How They Connect:**
- **Systematization and Challenge:** Teachers systematize truth, making it understandable and accessible. Prophets challenge people to live faithfully to truth, exposing gaps between belief and behavior.
- **Understanding and Obedience:** Teachers help people understand what is true. Prophets help people obey what is true. Both are needed—understanding without obedience is empty, obedience without understanding can be misguided.
- **Preservation and Renewal:** Teachers preserve truth across generations. Prophets renew commitment to truth in each generation. Together, they ensure truth is both preserved and alive.
- **Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy:** Teachers emphasize right thinking (orthodoxy). Prophets emphasize right practice (orthopraxy). Both are needed for authentic faith.

**Nature of Relationship:** Complementary disciplines. They work together to ensure truth is both understood and lived—orthodoxy and orthopraxy in balance.

**Key Insight:** A church with only teachers becomes intellectually rigorous but practically unfaithful. A church with only prophets becomes morally demanding but theologically shallow. Together, they create communities that both know and live the truth.

```

### Relationship Patterns

**Foundational Pair:** Apostle + Prophet (foundation of the church)
**Growth Pair:** Apostle + Evangelist (multiplication + addition)
**Depth Pair:** Prophet + Shepherd (justice + compassion)
**Stability Pair:** Teacher + Apostle (preservation + innovation)
**Retention Pair:** Evangelist + Shepherd (recruitment + retention)
**Truth Pair:** Teacher + Prophet (understanding + obedience)

### The APE/ST Tension

**APE Functions (Change Agents):**
- Apostle: Pioneering, extending, multiplying
- Prophet: Challenging, calling to faithfulness
- Evangelist: Recruiting, gathering, connecting

**ST Functions (Stability Providers):**
- Shepherd: Nurturing, caring, protecting
- Teacher: Grounding, explaining, systematizing

**The Tension:** APE functions create change, movement, and extension. ST functions provide stability, grounding, and retention. Both are needed in dynamic tension. The Western church has over-emphasized ST and exiled APE, creating equilibrium and stasis.

## Integration Principles

### 1. All Five Are Needed

The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). Removing any function creates dysfunction. The Western church's truncation to ST functions has created churches incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement.

### 2. Complementary, Not Competitive

Functions are designed to complement, not compete with each other. When functions compete, the church fragments. When functions complement, the church thrives. Understanding relationships helps functions work together rather than against each other.

### 3. Distributed, Not Hierarchical

All five functions should be distributed throughout the Body, not concentrated in a few leaders. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs to activate the ministry of all believers, not just clergy.

### 4. System, Not Silo

Functions work as an integrated system, not isolated silos. Each function needs the others to function fully. Apostles need prophets for faithfulness, prophets need shepherds for compassion, teachers need apostles for relevance, evangelists need shepherds for retention.

### 5. Dynamic Tension

Healthy relationships include dynamic tension—functions pull in different directions, but this tension is creative, not destructive. The tension between APE (change) and ST (stability) is essential for healthy movement.

## Practical Implications

### For Diagnosis

When diagnosing church health, ask:
- **Which functions are present?** Are all five functioning, or are some missing?
- **Which functions are dominant?** Is one function over-emphasized?
- **How do functions relate?** Are they complementary or competitive?
- **Where are functions located?** Are they distributed or concentrated?
- **What's the APE/ST balance?** Is there healthy tension between change and stability?

### For Strategy

When developing strategies:
- **Recover Missing Functions:** Identify and activate exiled functions (usually APE)
- **Balance Functions:** Ensure no single function dominates
- **Create Partnerships:** Pair functions that complement (apostle-prophet, evangelist-shepherd)
- **Distribute Functions:** Activate all believers, not just leaders
- **Maintain Tension:** Keep healthy tension between APE and ST functions

### For Leadership

Leaders must:
- **Understand Their Function:** Know which function(s) they primarily express
- **Appreciate Others:** Value and depend on functions they don't primarily express
- **Create Integration:** Help functions work together, not compete
- **Model Complementarity:** Show how functions enhance each other
- **Distribute Leadership:** Release functions throughout the Body, not just in leaders

## Examples

### Example 1: Healthy Fivefold Integration

A church with all five functions working together:
- **Apostles:** Pioneering new missional initiatives, planting churches
- **Prophets:** Challenging to faithfulness, calling for justice
- **Evangelists:** Recruiting people to the cause, creating on-ramps
- **Shepherds:** Nurturing people in community, creating belonging
- **Teachers:** Grounding people in truth, equipping for mission

Result: Healthy movement with growth, depth, stability, and faithfulness.

### Example 2: ST-Heavy Church (Common Problem)

A church operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher functions:
- **Strengths:** Stability, care, teaching, retention
- **Weaknesses:** No pioneering, no challenge, no recruitment
- **Result:** Healthy community but no movement, no growth, no missional engagement

### Example 3: APE-Heavy Church (Less Common)

A church operating primarily with Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions:
- **Strengths:** Movement, challenge, recruitment, extension
- **Weaknesses:** Little care, little grounding, high turnover
- **Result:** Lots of activity but people burn out, lack depth, struggle to retain

### Example 4: Apostle-Prophet Partnership

A movement with strong apostle-prophet partnership:
- **Apostles:** Pioneering new territories, extending the mission
- **Prophets:** Keeping apostles grounded, ensuring faithfulness
- **Result:** Movement that is both innovative and faithful, extending and deep

*Understanding APEST function relationships is essential for recovering the full capacity of the Body of Christ. The five functions are not competitors but complementary partners, each bringing unique intelligence and capacity. When all five functions operate together in healthy relationship, the church attains the fullness of Christ and becomes capable of adaptive mission and transformative movement.*
