# How Do I Activate APEST/5Q?

## Direct Answer

To activate APEST/5Q in your church, begin by recognizing that all five functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) are needed and that they should be distributed throughout the Body of Christ, not just concentrated in leadership. Assess which functions are present and active, which are missing or suppressed, and which are overemphasized. Then create space for all five functions to operate by restructuring leadership teams, creating new roles, or simply recognizing and releasing people to function in their gifting. Develop a culture that values all five functions—celebrate different expressions of ministry, don't force everyone into the same mold, and recognize that the church needs pioneers and challengers as much as it needs caregivers and teachers.

Activation requires moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers. Every member has a role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world. Build teams that include all five functions—when starting new initiatives, ensure you have apostolic vision, prophetic discernment, evangelistic passion, shepherding care, and teaching wisdom. The combination of all five creates powerful synergy. Use APEST as a diagnostic tool to assess your church's health: Are all five functions present? Are they operating? Are they in balance? What's missing? What's overemphasized?

## Expanded Explanation

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. The "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents, while "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. Both are needed in dynamic tension.

To activate APEST, you must first recognize that all five functions are necessary. The church needs all five operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13. You can't pick and choose. While contexts may require different emphasis, all five are essential.

Activation begins with assessment. Look beyond traditional leadership roles. The apostle might be the entrepreneur starting new initiatives. The prophet might be the one asking uncomfortable questions. The evangelist might be the one naturally sharing faith. The shepherd might be the one caring for people. The teacher might be the one explaining things clearly.

Create space for all five functions to operate. This might mean:
- Restructuring leadership teams to include all five functions
- Creating new roles that recognize different functions
- Simply recognizing and releasing people to function in their gifting
- Moving beyond the clergy-laity divide

Develop a culture that values all five functions. Celebrate different expressions of ministry. Don't force everyone into the same mold. Recognize that the church needs pioneers and challengers as much as it needs caregivers and teachers. Create environments where all five functions can flourish.

Build teams that include all five functions. When starting new initiatives, ensure you have:
- Apostolic vision (seeing new possibilities)
- Prophetic discernment (challenging and calling to faithfulness)
- Evangelistic passion (gathering and connecting people)
- Shepherding care (caring for people and building community)
- Teaching wisdom (explaining and equipping)

The combination of all five creates powerful synergy. Teams that have all five functions operating together are more effective than teams that are missing functions.

Use APEST as a diagnostic tool. Assess your church's health by asking:
- Are all five functions present?
- Are they operating?
- Are they in balance?
- What's missing?
- What's overemphasized?

Activation requires moving beyond the clergy-laity divide. Activate the ministry of all believers. Every member has a role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world. Don't limit ministry to paid staff or official positions.

Recognize that everyone carries elements of all five functions, with one or two typically dominant. Help people discover their APEST function and release them to operate in it. Don't force people into roles that don't match their function.

## Key Points

- **All five needed**: The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ."

- **Distributed throughout Body**: APEST functions should be distributed throughout the Body, not just concentrated in leadership.

- **Everyone has all five**: Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant.

- **Create space**: Restructure teams, create new roles, or recognize and release people to function in their gifting.

- **Value all functions**: Develop culture that celebrates different expressions of ministry.

- **Build balanced teams**: Teams that include all five functions are more effective.

- **Move beyond clergy-laity**: Activate the ministry of all believers.

- **Use as diagnostic**: Assess church health by evaluating APEST functions.

## Practical Application

Begin with assessment. Identify people in your church who demonstrate each function. Look beyond traditional leadership roles. The apostle might be starting new initiatives. The prophet might be asking uncomfortable questions. The evangelist might be sharing faith. The shepherd might be caring for people. The teacher might be explaining things clearly.

Help people discover their APEST function. Provide assessments, conversations, and opportunities for people to explore their function. Don't force people into roles that don't match their function.

Use APEST as a diagnostic tool. Assess your church's health by asking: Are all five functions present? Are they operating? Are they in balance? What's missing? What's overemphasized?

Address imbalances. If you're overemphasizing ST functions, intentionally make space for APE functions. If you're missing a function, look for people who demonstrate it and release them.

## Examples

The early church demonstrates APEST activated. The apostles (like Paul) extended the movement into new territories. The prophets (like Agabus) discerned God's direction. The evangelists (like Philip) proclaimed the gospel and gathered people. The shepherds (like James) cared for the community. The teachers (like Apollos) explained and equipped. All five functions were present and active.

Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions. As Apostle, he pioneered a new movement. As Prophet, he challenged religious systems. As Evangelist, he proclaimed good news and gathered disciples. As Shepherd, he cared for people and created community. As Teacher, he explained truth and equipped his followers.

Contemporary churches that have activated APEST show greater health and missional effectiveness. They have apostolic leaders starting new initiatives, prophetic voices challenging the status quo, evangelistic passion for sharing good news, shepherding care for people, and teaching that equips and grounds.

The Methodist movement under Wesley demonstrates APEST. Wesley himself was apostolic (pioneering a movement), prophetic (challenging the church), and evangelistic (proclaiming in fields and marketplaces). The movement also had shepherding (class meetings for care) and teaching (systematic instruction).

## Common Misunderstandings

**"APEST is just about leadership roles"**: No, APEST functions are forms of organizational intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ.

**"Some functions are more important than others"**: All five functions are necessary. The church needs all five operating simultaneously.

**"I only have one function"**: Everyone carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. You're not limited to just one function.

**"We can operate with just Shepherd and Teacher"**: While ST functions provide stability, the church also needs APE functions for missional engagement and adaptive change.

**"APEST is a personality test"**: APEST is about functions and intelligence, not personality. It's about how you contribute to the Body.

**"Only leaders need to know their APEST function"**: Everyone should understand their APEST function because everyone has a role to play.

**"APEST replaces spiritual gifts"**: APEST complements spiritual gifts. It's a framework for understanding how ministry functions.
