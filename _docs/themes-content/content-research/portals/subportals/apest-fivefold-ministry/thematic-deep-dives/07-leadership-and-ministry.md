# Leadership and Ministry: The Fivefold Intelligence

## Theme Overview

APEST represents the fivefold ministry framework found in Ephesians 4:11, where Christ gives gifts to his church: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds (Pastors), and Teachers. In 5Q, this framework is expanded and deepened, revealing APEST not merely as ministry functions but as five forms of intelligence (5Q) that are both the primordial template for church life and universal archetypes present throughout human culture.

These are not merely leadership roles but forms of organizational intelligence that should be distributed throughout the entire Body of Christ. Every believer carries elements of all five, with one or two typically dominant. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain the "fullness of Christ" mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.

The fivefold functions operate as:
- **Apostle (AQ)**: Pioneering intelligence—extending, multiplying, architecting, mobilizing
- **Prophet (PQ)**: Discerning intelligence—challenging, calling to covenant faithfulness, exposing falsehood
- **Evangelist (EQ)**: Recruiting intelligence—gathering, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause
- **Shepherd (SQ)**: Nurturing intelligence—caring, protecting, building community, creating belonging
- **Teacher (TQ)**: Grounding intelligence—explaining, equipping, systematizing, preserving truth

A critical insight developed in 5Q is that APEST functions are not limited to Christian contexts. They appear as universal archetypes throughout human culture—in business, arts, politics, education, and every domain of human endeavor. This is because they reflect the imago Dei, the image of God in humanity, and ultimately reflect aspects of God's own being. Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions, and the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature.

The Western church has largely "exiled" the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions, operating primarily with Shepherd and Teacher (the "ST" model). This truncation creates organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement. The "APE" functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist) are the change agents, while "ST" functions (Shepherd, Teacher) provide stability. Both are needed in dynamic tension.

5Q positions APEST as the "marks of a true church"—not the traditional institutional marks, but fivefold marks: apostolic (missional), prophetic (holy and just), evangelistic (proclaiming good news), shepherding (reconciled community), and teaching (wisdom and truth). These marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools, enabling leaders to assess organizational health and develop strategies for holistic maturity.

The framework has profound implications for leadership development, organizational structure, discipleship pathways, and the very nature of ministry. It calls for moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers, recognizing that every member of the Body has a vital role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world.

## Development Across the Corpus

The theme of APEST/5Q appears throughout the corpus, receiving its most comprehensive treatment in **5Q** (2017) and **The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim), but it is also developed in other works.

**The Forgotten Ways** (2006): Chapter 8, "APEST Culture," establishes this as one of the six essential elements of mDNA. The chapter emphasizes that if you want missional movements, you must have apostolic ministry. It argues that the Western church has largely "exiled" the apostolic function, and this exclusion has cauterized the church's missional capacity. The chapter develops the apostolic job description and shows how apostolic ministry is essential for movements.

**The Permanent Revolution** (2012, with Tim Catchim): This book provides comprehensive treatment of APEST throughout, especially Chapters 1-4. It develops the framework as both functions (organizational dimensions) and callings (individual expressions). It shows how each function operates, how they work together, and how the truncation of APE functions has created dysfunction in the Western church.

**5Q: Reactivating the Original Intelligence and Capacity of the Body of Christ** (2017): This entire book is dedicated to this theme. It expands APEST into 5Q (five forms of intelligence), showing how these are not merely ministry functions but universal archetypes present throughout human culture. It positions 5Q as the church's operating system and shows how all five forms of intelligence are needed for the church to attain the "fullness of Christ."

**On the Verge** (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Integrated throughout as part of Apostolic Genius, showing how large churches can transition toward missional movements by activating all five functions. The book shows how APEST culture enables movements to form and multiply.

**Untamed** (2010, with Debra Hirsch): Chapter 5, "The Church That Jesus Built," touches on fivefold ministry in relation to discipleship and mission. It emphasizes that the church needs all five functions to be truly missional.

**The Starfish and the Spirit** (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner): Integrated throughout, showing how distributed leadership requires all five functions operating throughout the organization, not just at the top.

**The Forgotten Ways Handbook** (2012, with Darryn Altclass): Chapter 5, "Apostolic Environment," provides practical guidance for developing APEST culture. It outlines habits and practices for organizing communities around fivefold ministry and developing ministry capacity.

Throughout this development, the consistent core remains: APEST/5Q is essential for movements. The church needs all five functions operating simultaneously to attain maturity and have transformative impact. The evolving application shows how this theme applies to different contexts—from small missional communities to large churches, from individual callings to organizational functions.

## Theological Foundations

The APEST/5Q framework is deeply rooted in biblical theology, drawing from Ephesians 4:7-16, where Paul describes how Christ gives gifts to his church for the purpose of building up the Body until it attains "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

**Ephesians 4:7-16**: This passage establishes that Christ gives gifts (apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers) to the church for the purpose of equipping the saints for works of ministry, building up the Body of Christ, and attaining unity in faith and knowledge of the Son of God. The goal is maturity—"attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

The passage emphasizes that these gifts are given to the entire Body, not just to leaders. The purpose is to equip all believers for ministry, moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to activate the ministry of all believers. This is a radical departure from hierarchical models of ministry.

**The Image of God (Imago Dei)**: The fivefold functions reflect the imago Dei, the image of God in humanity. They are universal archetypes present throughout human culture because they reflect aspects of God's own being. Jesus perfectly embodies all five functions, and the church is called to mirror this fivefold nature.

**The Body of Christ**: The metaphor of the body (1 Corinthians 12) shows how different parts have different functions, and all are needed for the body to function properly. Just as the human body needs all its systems (cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, etc.), so the Body of Christ needs all five APEST functions to be fully functional.

**The Fullness of Christ**: Ephesians 4:13 speaks of attaining "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." This fullness cannot be achieved with only some of the functions. All five are needed for the church to mature and have transformative impact.

**The Priesthood of All Believers**: The fivefold framework supports the priesthood of all believers by showing that ministry is not limited to a professional class but is distributed throughout the entire Body. Every believer has a calling and a role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world.

**Theological Flow**: The fivefold framework follows a theological flow: Christology (Jesus embodies all five) determines missiology (mission requires all five) which determines ecclesiology (church structure must enable all five). We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right, and we cannot get mission right unless it flows from our understanding of who Jesus is and what he came to do.

This theological foundation underscores that APEST/5Q is not a human invention but a divine design, rooted in the very nature of God and the pattern of Christ's ministry.

## Historical Precedents

Throughout church history, movements that have had transformative impact have been characterized by the recovery of one or more of the five functions, particularly the APE functions that have been exiled in the Western church.

**Catholic Orders**: Various orders have recovered different functions:
- Franciscans: Prophetic and Shepherding
- Jesuits: Apostolic
- Benedictines: Teaching
- Carmelites: Mystical-Prophetic

**Protestant Movements**: Various movements have recovered lost functions:
- Sending and mission agencies: Recoveries of lost APE functions
- Para-church organizations:
  - Campus Crusade (Cru): Apostolic-Evangelistic
  - Navigators: Evangelistic-Disciple-making
  - Intervarsity: Evangelistic-Teaching
  - World Vision: Prophetic

**Historical Exemplars**: Various historical figures have embodied different APEST callings:
- St. Patrick: Apostle/Shepherd
- Francis of Assisi: Prophet/Apostle
- Teresa of Ávila: Prophet/Teacher
- Martin Luther: Prophet/Teacher
- John Calvin: Teacher
- John Wesley: Apostle/Prophet
- Catherine Booth: Apostle
- Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Prophet/Teacher
- George Whitefield: Evangelist
- Billy Graham: Evangelist
- Mother Teresa: Shepherd
- Martin Luther King Jr.: Prophet

The Body of Christ would not be faithful—perhaps could not even survive—without these historical expressions of APEST. Movements that have recovered the exiled functions have had transformative impact, while movements that have lost them have declined.

The pattern is clear: movements that maintain all five functions thrive, movements that lose them decline. APEST/5Q is not optional but essential for movements to form and multiply.

## Contemporary Applications

In contemporary Western contexts, the church faces significant challenges in recovering and maintaining all five functions. The truncation to the ST model has created organizational equilibrium and stasis, making the church incapable of adaptive change and missional engagement.

The contemporary application requires:

**Recovering the Exiled Functions**: The Western church must recover the Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist functions that have been exiled. This requires recognizing that these functions are not limited to the first century but are ongoing gifts to the church. It requires creating environments where these functions can flourish.

**Distributing Leadership**: Leadership must be distributed throughout the organization, not concentrated at the top. This means activating the ministry of all believers, recognizing that every member of the Body has a vital role to play. It means moving beyond the clergy-laity divide to create a culture where all five functions operate throughout the organization.

**Creating APEST Culture**: Organizations must create culture that enables all five functions to flourish. This means organizing communities around fivefold ministry, developing ministry capacity, and ensuring that all five functions are operational within the leadership group. It means custom-building systems that suit each context.

**Assessing Organizational Health**: The fivefold framework provides diagnostic tools for assessing organizational health. Leaders can use APEST profiles to identify strengths and weaknesses, develop strategies for holistic maturity, and ensure that all five functions are present and operating.

**Developing Individual Callings**: Every disciple is obligated to strive to understand and live into their calling as Christ has apportioned it (Ephesians 4:1, 7). The APEST framework is the best way of grasping that calling. Each person can and should develop a unique APEST portrait—a picture of one's identity and destiny in and by Jesus.

**Avoiding Dominance**: When one function dominates the others, it creates unhealthy bias and disrupts the spiritual ecology of Jesus' body. Organizations must ensure that all five functions are present and operating in dynamic tension, not allowing any one function to dominate.

**Integrating Functions**: True maturity arises from integration—a "symphony" of all five dimensions. Each function needs the others to make the whole work. Organizations must create environments where all five functions can work together in harmony.

The contemporary application requires churches to resist the pull of the ST model and instead embrace the full fivefold framework that enables movements to form and multiply.

## Interdisciplinary Connections

The theme of APEST/5Q connects to insights from multiple disciplines:

**Organizational Theory**: The study of how organizations function shows the importance of having all necessary functions present. The work on organizational intelligence shows how different forms of intelligence are needed for organizations to adapt and thrive. The work on distributed leadership shows how leadership must be distributed throughout the organization.

**Psychology**: The study of personality and calling shows how individuals have different gifts and callings. The work on multiple intelligences (Howard Gardner) shows how different forms of intelligence are needed. The work on vocation shows how individuals find meaning through their unique callings.

**Anthropology**: The study of culture shows how these archetypes appear throughout human culture. The work on universal archetypes (Carl Jung) shows how these patterns are present across cultures. The work on cultural anthropology helps us understand how these functions operate in different contexts.

**Theology**: The study of ministry and leadership shows how the fivefold framework is rooted in biblical theology. The work on the priesthood of all believers shows how ministry is distributed. The work on the Body of Christ shows how different parts have different functions.

**Leadership Studies**: The study of leadership shows how different leadership styles are needed for different situations. The work on adaptive leadership shows how leaders must adapt to changing contexts. The work on transformational leadership shows how leaders must enable transformation.

**Systems Theory**: The study of systems shows how all parts must be present for the system to function properly. The work on organizational systems shows how different functions are needed. The work on complexity shows how systems need all necessary components.

These interdisciplinary connections enrich our understanding of how APEST/5Q functions as both spiritual reality and practical framework for organizational health and mission.

## Practical Implications

The theme of APEST/5Q has profound practical implications for churches, leaders, and individual disciples:

**For Churches**: Churches must create APEST culture, organizing their life around fivefold ministry. This means ensuring that all five functions are present and operating, distributing leadership throughout the organization, and creating environments where all five functions can flourish. Churches must resist the pull of the ST model and instead embrace the full fivefold framework.

**For Leaders**: Leaders must model the fivefold framework, demonstrating how all five functions work together. Leaders must create environments where all five functions can flourish, providing frameworks and practices that enable fivefold ministry. Leaders must recognize that you cannot lead where you will not go; you cannot teach what you do not know.

**For Individual Disciples**: Every disciple must commit to discovering and developing their APEST calling. This means taking APEST profiles, understanding one's unique calling, and developing the capacity to operate in all five functions while specializing in one or two. Disciples must recognize that they have a vital role to play in extending Christ's ministry to the world.

**Specific Applications**:
- Take APEST profiles to discover individual callings
- Organize communities around fivefold ministry
- Develop ministry capacity through fivefold training
- Ensure all five functions are operational in leadership
- Create environments where all five functions can flourish
- Assess organizational health using fivefold diagnostics
- Avoid allowing any one function to dominate
- Integrate all five functions in dynamic tension
- Distribute leadership throughout the organization
- Move beyond the clergy-laity divide
- Activate the ministry of all believers
- Use fivefold framework for discipleship pathways

## Critical Questions

This theme raises important questions that require ongoing exploration:

**How do we recover the exiled functions without creating chaos?** The APE functions are change agents that can create disruption. How do we recover them in ways that lead to positive outcomes rather than destructive chaos?

**How do we avoid dominance while ensuring all functions are present?** When one function dominates, it creates unhealthy bias. How do we ensure all five functions are present and operating in dynamic tension?

**How do we distribute leadership while maintaining coherence?** Leadership must be distributed, but how do we maintain coherence and direction? How do we avoid fragmentation while distributing authority?

**How do we develop individual callings while maintaining organizational functions?** Individual callings are important, but so are organizational functions. How do we develop both without losing one or the other?

**How do we create APEST culture in ST-dominated contexts?** Most Western churches are ST-dominated. How do we create APEST culture in these contexts without creating conflict or losing people?

**How do we measure fivefold health?** Traditional metrics don't capture fivefold health. How do we know when all five functions are present and operating? How do we measure maturity?

**How do we integrate functions in practice?** Integration is essential, but how do we do it in practice? How do we create environments where all five functions work together in harmony?

These questions require ongoing conversation, experimentation, and discernment as we seek to recover and maintain APEST/5Q in contemporary contexts.
