# What is Disciplism?

## Direct Answer

Disciplism addresses the alarming loss of discipleship as a central practice in the contemporary church and proposes that evangelism must be reframed within the context of discipleship rather than the reverse. The term itself suggests that discipleship should be the "ism" that shapes our approach—not evangelism as a separate activity, but disciplism as the comprehensive framework. The key insight is "begin with the end in mind"—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start.

The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has created a Christianity that makes converts but not disciples. Disciplism critiques how contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach. Jesus' ministry and early church practice demonstrate that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

## Expanded Explanation

Given that I have previously written about the strategic need for discipleship and disciple making in The Forgotten Ways and written specifically on the spiritual dynamics of discipleship in Untamed, I tend to get asked a few questions. Mostly, the questions reflect a fair bit of ignorance of the meaning and significance of disciple making, as well as a loss of ability to even articulate what is involved (context); what the end game is (agenda); as well as how to actually do it (practice).

I have to admit that I find this ignorance pretty alarming given that from any fair reading of the New Testament itself, discipleship and disciple making lay at the very heart of the church's gospel mandate in the world. Of all the things we have chosen to remember over 2,000 years—all those little doctrinal quirks, the inexplicable religious rituals, and those pesky marginal traditions that we perpetuate in the church—we have somehow managed to all but forget the essential gospel mandate to make disciples of the nations. How is this possible?

A critical insight developed in Disciplism is that discipleship is evangelism's true context, not the other way around. The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has had catastrophic consequences, creating a Christianity without discipleship, which as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, is always Christianity without Christ.

Disciplism addresses how contemporary evangelism has been co-opted by consumerism, creating a "make consumers of all nations" approach that fails to challenge the primary religion of most seekers. Jesus' ministry and early church practice demonstrate that discipleship should begin even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom—the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

The key insight is "begin with the end in mind"—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start. Evangelism, worship, community, and mission all serve the larger purpose of making disciples who can make disciples. This means that evangelism is not a separate activity but part of the disciple-making process. Worship is not entertainment but formation. Community is not comfort but challenge. Mission is not optional but essential.

Authentic discipleship involves embodying the message and mission of Jesus, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It is a Jesus-saturated affair that requires active modeling of one's life on Jesus, letting him live through us. Discipleship means learning to think, feel, and act like Jesus—not just knowing about him but knowing him and being known by him in the most intimate sense.

The mDNA of discipleship involves several key elements: Jesus-shaped discipleship (centered on Christ's person and example), Shema spirituality (loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength), the inseparability of mission and discipleship (you cannot have one without the other), and the prophetic call to faithfulness (discipleship requires radical obedience).

Every significant missional movement in history has been built on a foundation of rigorous disciple-making. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover that it is the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact. Discipleship is not an optional extra for the committed few; it is the non-negotiable core practice of the church.

## Practical Application

To implement disciplism, begin by shifting your understanding of evangelism. Recognize that evangelism is not a separate activity but part of the disciple-making process. The goal is not just to get people to make a decision but to make disciples who can make disciples.

Begin with the end in mind. If the end goal is making disciples, then orient everything toward that goal from the start. This means:
- Evangelism serves disciple-making, not the other way around
- Worship is formation, not entertainment
- Community is challenge, not just comfort
- Mission is essential, not optional

Reframe evangelism within discipleship. Instead of event-based proclamation and altar calls, focus on the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. Invite people into a journey of following Jesus, not just making a decision. Start the disciple-making process even before people become regenerated converts.

Challenge consumerism. Don't create a "make consumers of all nations" approach. The cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning. Discipleship requires sacrifice, not just consumption. Help people understand that following Jesus costs something.

Develop Jesus-shaped discipleship. Center everything on Christ's person and example. Help people become like Jesus in character, passion, and practice. This is not just knowing about Jesus but knowing him and being known by him.

Practice Shema spirituality. Help people love God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. This sets the agenda for all aspects of Christian life. Discipleship is not compartmentalized but whole-life transformation.

Integrate mission and discipleship. You cannot have one without the other. Discipleship is inherently missional. Help people see that following Jesus means joining his mission in the world.

Make discipleship the core practice. It's not an optional extra for the committed few but the non-negotiable core practice of the church. Everything else serves this purpose.

## Examples

Jesus' ministry demonstrates disciplism. He didn't focus on event-based proclamation and altar calls. Instead, he made disciples through long-term, relational process. He invited people into a journey of following him, not just making a decision. He started the disciple-making process even before people fully understood who he was.

The early church practiced disciplism. They made disciples through relationship, not just proclamation. New believers were integrated into communities where they learned to follow Jesus. The process was long-term and relational, not just event-based.

The Methodist movement under Wesley shows disciplism. Wesley didn't just preach and hope people responded. He created class meetings and societies where people could be discipled. The focus was on making disciples who could make disciples, not just getting decisions.

Contemporary churches that practice disciplism show different patterns. They reframe evangelism within discipleship. They invite people into a journey, not just a decision. They start the disciple-making process early and continue it long-term. They challenge consumerism and help people understand that following Jesus costs something.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Disciplism means abandoning evangelism"**: No, disciplism reframes evangelism within discipleship. Evangelism still happens, but it's part of the disciple-making process, not a separate activity.

**"Disciplism is too slow"**: While disciplism is a long-term process, it's actually more effective because it creates disciples who can make disciples, leading to multiplication rather than just addition.

**"Disciplism is only for mature Christians"**: Disciplism begins even before people become regenerated converts. The disciple-making process starts early and continues long-term.

**"Disciplism means no altar calls"**: Disciplism doesn't eliminate decisions, but it reframes them within the larger context of disciple-making. Decisions are part of the journey, not the end goal.

**"Disciplism is too demanding"**: While disciplism is demanding, it's also more authentic and effective. The cross must define our relationship to God from the beginning.

**"Disciplism is just small groups"**: While small groups can be part of disciplism, it's broader than that. It's about reframing everything—evangelism, worship, community, mission—within disciple-making.

**"Disciplism means abandoning the Great Commission"**: On the contrary, disciplism is about recovering the true meaning of the Great Commission, which is to "make disciples," not just get decisions.

**"Disciplism is a new idea"**: Disciplism is actually the biblical norm. It's the church growth movement that reversed the order, not disciplism.
