# How Do I Implement Disciplism?

## Direct Answer

To implement disciplism, begin by shifting your understanding of evangelism. Recognize that evangelism is not a separate activity but part of the disciple-making process. The goal is not just to get people to make a decision but to make disciples who can make disciples. Begin with the end in mind: if the end goal is making disciples, then orient everything toward that goal from the start. This means evangelism serves disciple-making (not the other way around), worship is formation (not entertainment), community is challenge (not just comfort), and mission is essential (not optional).

Reframe evangelism within discipleship. Instead of event-based proclamation and altar calls, focus on the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. Invite people into a journey of following Jesus, not just making a decision. Start the disciple-making process even before people become regenerated converts and continue until the end. Challenge consumerism—don't create a "make consumers of all nations" approach. The cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning. Develop Jesus-shaped discipleship that centers everything on Christ's person and example. Practice Shema spirituality—helping people love God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. Integrate mission and discipleship, recognizing that you cannot have one without the other.

## Expanded Explanation

Disciplism addresses the alarming loss of discipleship as a central practice in the contemporary church and proposes that evangelism must be reframed within the context of discipleship rather than the reverse. The key insight is "begin with the end in mind"—if the end goal is making disciples, then everything must be oriented toward that goal from the start.

The Great Commission explicitly commands us to "make disciples," and evangelism happens naturally within that process. The church growth movement reversed this order, focusing on event-based proclamation and altar calls rather than the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. This reversal has created a Christianity that makes converts but not disciples.

To implement disciplism, you must:

1. **Reframe evangelism within discipleship**: Evangelism is not a separate activity but part of the disciple-making process. The goal is making disciples, not just getting decisions.

2. **Begin with the end in mind**: If the end goal is making disciples, orient everything toward that goal. Evangelism, worship, community, and mission all serve the larger purpose of making disciples who can make disciples.

3. **Challenge consumerism**: Don't create a "make consumers of all nations" approach. The cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning. One cannot consume one's way into the kingdom.

4. **Develop Jesus-shaped discipleship**: Center everything on Christ's person and example. Help people become like Jesus in character, passion, and practice.

5. **Practice Shema spirituality**: Help people love God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength. This sets the agenda for all aspects of Christian life.

6. **Integrate mission and discipleship**: You cannot have one without the other. Discipleship is inherently missional.

## Examples

Jesus' ministry demonstrates disciplism. He didn't focus on event-based proclamation. Instead, he made disciples through long-term, relational process.

The early church practiced disciplism. They made disciples through relationship, not just proclamation. New believers were integrated into communities where they learned to follow Jesus.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Disciplism means abandoning evangelism"**: No, disciplism reframes evangelism within discipleship. Evangelism still happens, but it's part of the disciple-making process.

**"Disciplism is too slow"**: While disciplism is a long-term process, it's actually more effective because it creates disciples who can make disciples.
