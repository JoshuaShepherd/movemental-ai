# Communitas: Liminal Community Forged in Shared Ordeal

## The Essential Definition

Communitas describes the type of communality or comradeship that forms when people are driven to find one another in a context of ordeal, testing, and transition. It is a deeper form of community than normal community—one that is forged in liminal space, through shared risk, adventure, and purpose. Unlike regular community, which can be comfortable and settled, communitas is formed when people are taken out of their normal safe environments and put in situations of disorientation and marginalization, where they must rely on one another to survive and thrive.

## The Full Explanation

There's a difference between community and communitas, and understanding that difference is crucial for understanding what makes missional movements so powerful. Regular community can be comfortable, settled, and focused on the needs of its members. Communitas is something else entirely—it's the deeper form of community that forms when people are driven to find one another in a context of ordeal, testing, and transition.

Think about it: when do people really find each other? It's often in times of crisis, challenge, or adventure. When the tsunami hit Asia in 2004, people from around the world came together in remarkable ways. When 9/11 happened, New York underwent an elemental transformation—people found one another, discovered their common humanity, and experienced a remarkable sense of togetherness.

This is communitas. It's what happens when people are taken out of their normal safe environments and put in situations where they must rely on one another. It's the comradeship that forms in shared ordeal, the bond that develops when facing challenge together.

Anthropologist Victor Turner, who developed this concept, observed that communitas happens in situations where individuals are driven to find one another in a context of ordeal or testing. It involves intense feelings of social togetherness and belonging that arise spontaneously in situations of disorientation and marginalization. In many ways, communitas is what creates and renews a tribal culture.

The most vigorous forms of community are those that come together in the context of a shared ordeal or those that deliberately place themselves in a risky situation, thus initiating a risky journey. Too much concern with safety and security can actually work against the church's true calling and purpose. We all love an adventure. Or do we?

The Bible is full of examples of communitas. Think of Abraham and his journey into the unknown. Think of the exodus, where the Israelites found each other in the wilderness. Think of Jesus and his disciples, who left everything and hit the road together. Think of the early church, persecuted and on the move, finding deep community in shared mission.

The book of Acts shows communitas in action. The early Christians were constantly in liminal space—persecuted, on the move, facing challenge together. This created a deeper form of community than they would have had if they'd stayed safe and settled.

For missional movements, communitas is not just a nice addition; it's essential. When people engage in risky mission together, when they face challenge and adventure, they find each other in new ways. This creates the kind of community that can sustain movement and transformation.

## Biblical Foundations

The Bible is full of examples of communitas. Abraham was called to leave everything and journey into the unknown, creating a community of faith around shared purpose. The exodus was a communitas experience—the Israelites found each other in the wilderness, forged in shared ordeal.

Jesus created communitas with his disciples. They left everything and hit the road together, facing danger and challenge. This created a deeper bond than normal community. The early church experienced communitas through persecution—they found each other in shared mission and risk.

Hebrews 11 describes the heroes of faith as those who "admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth" (Hebrews 11:13). They were a pilgrim people, always on the move, finding community in shared journey.

The book of Acts shows communitas in action. The early Christians were constantly in liminal space, facing challenge together. This created the kind of community that could sustain movement and transformation.

## Historical Development

The concept of communitas was developed by anthropologist Victor Turner, who observed that the most vigorous forms of community form in liminal spaces, through shared ordeal and purpose.

Throughout history, missional movements have demonstrated communitas. The early church found deep community in persecution. The Chinese underground church formed communitas through shared risk and mission. The Celtic missionaries experienced communitas on their journeys. The Moravians found communitas in their missionary sending.

The concept has been developed in the work:
- *The Forgotten Ways* (2006): Chapter 7, "Liminality and Communitas"
- *The Faith of Leap* (2011, with Michael Frost): Exploration of risk and communitas
- *On the Verge* (2011, with Dave Ferguson): Application to large churches

## Theological Significance

Communitas matters because it reveals something fundamental about how God shapes community. It shows us that the deepest forms of community are not formed in comfort and safety but in shared mission, risk, and adventure.

Communitas is essential for missional movements because it creates the kind of community that can sustain movement and transformation. Regular community can become comfortable and inward-focused. Communitas keeps us moving, keeps us on mission, keeps us dependent on one another and on God.

The church is meant to be a communitas, not just a community. We're meant to be a people on a journey together, facing challenge and adventure, finding each other in shared mission. When we lose this, we lose something essential to our identity.

## Practical Implications

For churches and leaders, understanding communitas means:

1. **Creating Liminal Experiences**: Intentionally creating spaces where people can experience challenge and adventure together.

2. **Mission as Organizing Principle**: Using mission to create communitas—when people engage in risky mission together, they find each other.

3. **Embracing Risk**: Recognizing that some risk is necessary for communitas to form. Too much safety works against it.

4. **Shared Purpose**: Ensuring that the community has a purpose beyond itself—mission creates communitas.

5. **Avoiding Comfort**: Resisting the temptation to make everything safe and comfortable. Some discomfort is necessary.

6. **Adventure Together**: Creating opportunities for people to face challenge and adventure together.

For individual believers, communitas means recognizing that the deepest community is found not in comfort but in shared mission and risk. We find each other when we're on a journey together, facing challenge, depending on one another.

## Interconnections

Communitas connects to all other mDNA elements:

- It's created by **liminality**—communitas forms in liminal space
- It's enabled by the **missional-incarnational impulse**—shared mission creates communitas
- It's formed through **disciple-making**—disciples find each other on the journey
- It's grounded in **"Jesus is Lord"**—shared allegiance creates deeper community
- It's enabled by **organic systems**—flexible structures that can handle adventure

Communitas also connects to broader frameworks:
- It's part of the **Metanoia Journey**—transformation happens in communitas
- It's created through **adventure and risk**
- It's the foundation for **movemental community**

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **"Communitas is just another word for community"**: No, it's a deeper form of community forged in liminal space and shared ordeal.

2. **"We should avoid risk"**: No, some risk is necessary for communitas to form. Too much safety works against it.

3. **"Communitas is temporary"**: For movements, communitas is often the normative form of community. The early church and Chinese church lived in communitas.

4. **"Community is enough"**: No, movements need communitas—the deeper community forged in mission and risk.

5. **"We can create communitas through programs"**: No, communitas forms organically in liminal space, through shared mission and risk.

6. **"Communitas is chaos"**: No, it's order at the edge of chaos. It's structured enough to hold together, fluid enough to adapt.
