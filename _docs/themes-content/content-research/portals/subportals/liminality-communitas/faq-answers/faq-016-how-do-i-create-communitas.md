# How Do I Create Communitas?

## Direct Answer

To create communitas, you must create liminal experiences—shared adventure, risk, and purpose that form deep togetherness. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk. It forms when people find themselves in transition between one state and another, outside normal structures and routines, facing disorientation, risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough. To create communitas, intentionally engage at the edges of society, take risks for the sake of mission, embrace uncertainty rather than trying to control everything, prioritize purpose over comfort, and create environments where people can experience shared challenge and adventure.

Communitas is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. It's not maintained through programs and activities but through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself. The distinction is crucial: regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?" To create communitas, you must be willing to step into liminal spaces—threshold experiences where the old has not yet fully passed away and the new has not yet fully arrived.

## Expanded Explanation

Liminality and communitas represent the dynamic relationship between threshold experiences and the deep community that forms through shared adventure. **Liminality** refers to threshold experiences—those times when people find themselves in transition between one state and another, outside normal structures and routines. The term comes from the Latin *limen*, meaning threshold. In liminal spaces, the old has not yet fully passed away and the new has not yet fully arrived. There is disorientation, risk, uncertainty, and the potential for both failure and breakthrough.

**Communitas** is the deep sense of comradeship and togetherness that forms when people share liminal experiences. It is community forged in crisis, friendship deepened through shared adventure, belonging that emerges from facing challenges together. Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life but the authentic togetherness that emerges when people engage in shared mission and risk.

The distinction between community and communitas is crucial. Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, "How can this serve me?" Communitas asks, "What can we accomplish together?" Community is maintained through programs and activities. Communitas is maintained through shared adventure and purpose beyond itself.

The early church experienced communitas through persecution, mission, and the radical demands of following Jesus. Contemporary churches often lose this because they prioritize safety, comfort, and stability. Middle-class culture, with its focus on security, consumption, and risk-aversion, functions as an "anti-missional virus" that gradually erodes the liminal edge and replaces communitas with consumeristic community.

Creating communitas requires intentional choices:
- Engaging at the edges of society
- Taking risks for the sake of mission
- Embracing uncertainty rather than trying to control everything
- Prioritizing purpose over comfort
- Creating environments where people can experience shared challenge and adventure

Liminality and communitas are not optional extras for the adventurous few but essential elements of mDNA that enable movements to form and thrive. Without them, community becomes consumeristic, mission becomes maintenance, and the church loses its transformative edge.

## Key Points

- **Liminal experiences**: Communitas forms through shared adventure, risk, and purpose.

- **Threshold spaces**: People must be in transition, outside normal structures, facing uncertainty.

- **Shared mission**: Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission, not just shared interests.

- **Not comfort-focused**: Communitas is not the safety-focused community of typical church life.

- **Essential for movement**: Liminality and communitas are essential elements of mDNA.

- **Intentional creation**: Requires intentional choices to engage at edges, take risks, embrace uncertainty.

- **Purpose over comfort**: Prioritize purpose over comfort, challenge over safety.

## Practical Application

Create liminal experiences. Intentionally engage at the edges of society. Take risks for the sake of mission. Embrace uncertainty rather than trying to control everything. Prioritize purpose over comfort.

Create environments where people can experience shared challenge and adventure. This might mean:
- Engaging in mission together
- Taking on challenges as a group
- Stepping into unfamiliar territory
- Facing risks together

Don't prioritize safety and comfort. While these are important, they can erode the liminal edge that creates communitas. Be willing to step into uncertainty.

Focus on shared purpose, not just shared interests. Communitas forms around mission, not just similarity. Help people see what they can accomplish together.

Create threshold experiences. Put people in situations where they're in transition, facing uncertainty, and needing to rely on each other and God.

Don't try to control everything. Liminality requires uncertainty. Trust that God will work in the liminal spaces.

Be patient. Communitas doesn't form overnight. It takes time and shared experience to develop deep togetherness.
