# Missional Church: Comprehensive Q&A Set

## Topic Introduction

This comprehensive Q&A set explores the missional church—a way of understanding and being the church that recognizes God's mission as primary and the church as sent by God into the world to participate in his mission. The missional church stands in contrast to attractional, institutional, or programmatic models of church.

**Scope of this Q&A set:** This set covers the definition of missional church, how it differs from other models, biblical foundations, practical implications, and common misunderstandings.

**How questions are organized:** Questions progress from foundational understanding, to comparison with other models, to biblical foundations, to practical application and implementation.

**How to use this Q&A set:** Use these questions to understand missional church comprehensively, compare with other models, and apply missional principles practically.

## Foundational Questions

### Question 1: What is a missional church, and how does it differ from other church models?

**Answer:**

A missional church is a way of understanding and being the church that recognizes God's mission (*missio Dei*) as primary and the church as sent by God into the world to participate in his mission. The term "missional" describes the nature and purpose of the church itself—the church is missional by nature, not just engaged in mission as one activity among many.

The missional church stands in contrast to several other models:

**Attractional Model:** The attractional church focuses on attracting people to come to the church. It asks, "How can we get people to come to us?" The missional church goes to people rather than expecting them to come. It asks, "How can we go to people and join what God is already doing?"

**Institutional Model:** The institutional church is organized around maintaining structures, programs, and organizations. It focuses on institutional stability and survival. The missional church is organized around mission and is willing to change structures to fulfill mission.

**Programmatic Model:** The programmatic church is organized around programs and activities. People are expected to fit into programs. The missional church is organized around people and mission, creating flexible approaches that serve people and mission rather than the other way around.

**Key Characteristics of Missional Church:**

1. **Sent-ness:** The church understands itself as sent by God into the world, just as Jesus was sent by the Father (John 20:21). This is not just about missionaries going to other countries; it's about the whole church being sent into its local context.

2. **Incarnational Presence:** The missional church goes deep into culture and context, becoming native to its context rather than remaining separate. Just as God became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14), the church is called to become native to its context.

3. **Mission as Identity:** Mission is not one activity among many; it's the identity and purpose of the church. The church doesn't have a mission; the church is mission. Mission flows from identity, not from programs.

4. **Cultural Engagement:** The missional church engages culture deeply, understanding that the gospel must be embedded in culture to be effective. This requires understanding culture, learning its language, and becoming native to it.

5. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** This combines going out (missional) with going deep (incarnational). The church extends outward into mission and embeds deep into culture simultaneously.

6. **Organic Rather Than Programmatic:** The missional church operates organically, responding to context and need, rather than programmatically, running predetermined programs regardless of context.

7. **Multiplication Focus:** The missional church focuses on multiplication—new expressions of church, new communities, new movements—rather than just addition to existing structures.

**Biblical Foundation:**

The missional understanding finds its foundation in:
- God's sending of Jesus (John 3:16, 20:21)
- Jesus' sending of the church (John 20:21, Matthew 28:18-20)
- The incarnation as model (John 1:14, Philippians 2:5-8)
- The early church as sent people (Acts 1:8, the book of Acts)
- The Great Commission as sending (Matthew 28:18-20)

**Key Points:**
- Missional describes the church's nature, not just activity
- Church is sent, not attractional
- Mission flows from identity
- Incarnational presence in culture

**Examples:**
- Early church as sent into the world
- Jesus' ministry as model of missional presence
- Churches that engage culture deeply

**Connections:**
- Missional-Incarnational Impulse as element of mDNA
- APEST functions enabling missional capacity
- Organic Systems enabling missional structures

**Practical Application:**
Understanding missional church helps churches shift from "How do we get people to come?" to "How do we go to people?" It shifts focus from programs to presence, from attraction to sending.

- How does missional relate to evangelism?
- What is the missional-incarnational impulse?
