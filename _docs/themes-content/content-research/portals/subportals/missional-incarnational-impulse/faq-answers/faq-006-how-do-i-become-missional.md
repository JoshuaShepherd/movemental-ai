# How Do I Become Missional?

## Direct Answer

To become missional, begin by shifting your understanding of mission from church-centered to God-centered. Recognize that God is a missionary God who is already at work in your community, and your role is to join what God is doing rather than trying to get God to bless what you're doing. This fundamental shift in perspective—from "the church has a mission" to "God's mission has a church"—changes everything about how you engage with the world.

Becoming missional involves developing practices that embody the missional-incarnational impulse: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). Start by identifying where God is already at work in your community—the "nooks and crannies" where people gather, relationships form, and life happens. Then practice presence: be fully present in those spaces, not as an outsider trying to extract people, but as a neighbor participating in community life. Build proximity by living in and engaging with the culture you're called to reach. Practice powerlessness by approaching with humility rather than trying to control or fix. Recognize prevenience—God's work already present—and join it rather than trying to start something new.

## Expanded Explanation

Becoming missional is not about adding outreach activities to an otherwise attractional approach. It's a fundamental shift in understanding the church's nature and purpose. The missional church recognizes that it is intrinsically incarnational; it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

The journey to becoming missional involves several key shifts:

**From attractional to missional**: Instead of expecting people to come to you, you go to them. This means leaving the comfort of church buildings and programs to engage in the spaces where people actually live, work, and play.

**From extractional to incarnational**: Instead of trying to extract people from their contexts and bring them into church, you embed yourself in their contexts and become good news there. You become native rather than remaining foreign.

**From church-centered to God-centered**: Instead of asking "How do we get people to come to our church?" you ask "Where is God already at work, and how do we join it?" You recognize that mission is not what the church does but what God is doing.

**From addition to multiplication**: Instead of focusing on adding people to your church, you focus on multiplying disciples and communities. You measure success by how many people are being sent out, not just how many are coming in.

**From programs to practices**: Instead of creating programs that people attend, you develop practices that people live. Missional practices become part of everyday life, not just scheduled activities.

The six practices of incarnation provide a practical framework:

1. **Presence**: Full identification with culture, being fully present in the spaces where people live and work.

2. **Proximity**: Geographic and relational closeness. You can't be missional from a distance. You need to be close enough to understand and engage.

3. **Powerlessness**: Approaching with humility rather than trying to control or fix. You come as a learner, not as an expert.

4. **Prevenience**: Recognizing God's work already present. You don't bring God to places; you join God where God already is.

5. **Passion**: Embracing redemptive suffering, being willing to enter into the pain and brokenness of your context.

6. **Proclamation**: Sharing the good news in ways that make sense to your context, speaking the language of the culture while maintaining the integrity of the gospel.

Becoming missional also involves shifting your metrics. Instead of measuring success by Sunday attendance, measure by how many people are being sent out, how many missional communities are forming, how the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces. Create structures that support sending rather than just gathering.

## Key Points

- **Six practices**: Presence, Proximity, Powerlessness, Prevenience, Passion, and Proclamation.

- **Shift metrics**: Measure sending, not just gathering. Measure multiplication, not just addition.

- **Develop practices**: Not just programs but practices that become part of everyday life.

- **Join God's work**: Recognize where God is already active and join it rather than trying to start something new.

- **Be patient**: Becoming missional is a journey, not a destination. It takes time and consistent practice.

## Practical Application

Start by shifting your understanding. Read about missional theology. Study how God is a missionary God. Understand that mission is not what the church does but what God is doing, and the church participates in that mission.

Develop "soft eyes"—the ability to see where God is already at work. Practice paying attention to your community. Where are people gathering? What are the networks and relationships? Where is God already active? Learn to see with fresh eyes rather than through the lens of church programs.

Identify your "nooks and crannies"—the places in your community where you can be present. This might be your neighborhood, your workplace, a local coffee shop, a community organization, or wherever you naturally spend time. Start by being present there, not as a church representative but as a neighbor.

Practice the six practices of incarnation:
- **Presence**: Be fully present in the spaces where people live and work. Don't be distracted or in a hurry.
- **Proximity**: Build geographic and relational closeness. Live in the community you're called to reach.
- **Powerlessness**: Approach with humility. Be a learner, not an expert. Ask questions rather than giving answers.
- **Prevenience**: Look for where God is already at work. Join it rather than trying to start something new.
- **Passion**: Be willing to enter into the pain and brokenness of your context. Don't avoid difficult places.
- **Proclamation**: Share good news in ways that make sense to your context. Speak the language of the culture.

Shift your metrics. Instead of measuring Sunday attendance, measure:
- How many people are being sent out
- How many missional communities are forming
- How the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces
- How relationships are forming in the community

Create structures that support sending. This might mean:
- Restructuring small groups to be missional communities
- Creating sending teams rather than just serving teams
- Developing rhythms that include both gathering and scattering
- Celebrating missional engagement, not just church attendance

Be patient. Becoming missional is a journey. It takes time to shift from attractional to missional thinking and practice. Don't expect immediate results. Focus on being faithful in the practices, and trust that God will work through them.

## Examples

The early church provides an example of missional living. They didn't have buildings to attract people to. Instead, they went to people, lived among them, and became good news in their contexts. They practiced presence, proximity, and proclamation in the spaces where people lived and worked.

The Chinese underground church demonstrates missional living under persecution. They couldn't operate attractionally—there was no place to attract people to. Instead, they operated missionally, going to people, embedding the gospel in communities, and multiplying through relationships.

Contemporary examples include people who have shifted from attractional to missional approaches. They've moved from expecting people to come to church to going to people. They've developed practices of presence, proximity, and proclamation. They measure success by sending and multiplication rather than just gathering and addition.

Neighborhood churches that have become missional show these patterns. They've identified their neighborhoods as their mission field. They practice presence by being fully present in neighborhood life. They build proximity by living in the community. They recognize prevenience by joining what God is already doing. They practice proclamation by sharing good news in ways that make sense to their neighbors.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Becoming missional means doing more outreach"**: No, becoming missional is a fundamental shift in understanding, not just adding activities. It's about changing how you see mission and the church's role.

**"Missional means abandoning the gathered church"**: Missional churches still gather, but gathering serves the purpose of sending, not the other way around. The church is both gathered and scattered.

**"Missional is only for certain people"**: Everyone can become missional. It's not about special gifting but about shifting perspective and developing practices.

**"Missional means being less committed to truth"**: On the contrary, missional people are deeply committed to the truth of the gospel. They simply recognize that truth must be contextualized.

**"Missional is just a new word for evangelism"**: Missional is broader than evangelism. It encompasses the whole of participation in God's mission, which includes evangelism but also justice, mercy, and cultural transformation.

**"Becoming missional is easy"**: Becoming missional requires significant shifts in thinking and practice. It's not easy, but it's essential and rewarding.

**"Missional means no structure"**: Missional churches need structure, but it's structure that supports sending rather than just gathering.

**"Missional is only for post-Christian contexts"**: While missional approaches are essential in post-Christian contexts, they're actually the biblical norm. The attractional approach worked in Christendom but is increasingly ineffective.
