# What is the Difference Between Missional and Attractional Church?

## Direct Answer

The fundamental difference between missional and attractional church is the direction of engagement: missional churches go to people, while attractional churches expect people to come to them. Missional churches understand themselves as a sent people, participating in God's mission to restore and heal creation. They operate from a "sending" approach, going out into culture and becoming native to their context. Attractional churches operate from a "come-and-get-it" approach, focusing on creating excellent programs, services, and experiences that attract people to come to the church building.

The missional approach recognizes that God is already at work in the world, and the church's role is to join what God is doing. The attractional approach focuses on getting people to come to church so the church can do something for them. Missional churches measure success by how many people are being sent out and how the gospel is being embedded in culture. Attractional churches measure success by how many people come to the building and attend programs. While both approaches can be valid in certain contexts, the missional approach is essential in post-Christian contexts and is actually the biblical norm. The attractional approach worked in Christendom contexts but is increasingly ineffective as culture becomes more post-Christian.

## Expanded Explanation

The missional-incarnational impulse represents the twin movements that characterize authentic Christian engagement with the world: going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). The missional impulse refers to the outward thrust, the sending nature of the church. It's the "sneeze-like" influence that releases the outward flow of the movement of God like seeds in the wind. This is a "sending" rather than an "attractional" approach—we go to them rather than expecting them to come to us.

The attractional approach, by contrast, focuses on creating excellent programs, services, and experiences that attract people to come to the church building. The seeds are put into ecclesial storehouses, effectively extinguishing the purpose they were made for. The attractional model focuses on church growth, which hinders the power of multiplication and makes it impossible to release a movement.

The missional approach recognizes that mission is not merely an activity of the church but the result of God's initiative—God is a missionary God, and therefore the church exists as a missionary people. The attractional approach, while it can be effective in certain contexts (m0-m1 on the missional scale), blocks the church's capacity to engage beyond significant cultural barriers. The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, and the church is intrinsically incarnational—it must become native to its context rather than remaining foreign.

The contrast can be visualized in several ways:

**Direction**: Missional = going out. Attractional = expecting people to come in.

**Focus**: Missional = joining what God is doing. Attractional = getting God to bless what the church is doing.

**Metrics**: Missional = measuring sending and multiplication. Attractional = measuring attendance and addition.

**Structure**: Missional = structures that support sending. Attractional = structures that support gathering.

**Engagement**: Missional = embedding in culture. Attractional = extracting from culture.

**Reproduction**: Missional = multiplication through relationships. Attractional = addition through programs.

**Context**: Missional = becoming native to context. Attractional = remaining foreign to context.

However, it's important to note that missional and attractional are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some churches successfully combine both approaches. However, the missional impulse must be primary, not secondary. The church is both gathered and scattered—we gather to be sent, not gather to stay.

The attractional approach worked well in Christendom contexts where Christianity was central to society. In those contexts, people were already inclined to come to church. But as culture becomes more post-Christian, the attractional approach becomes increasingly ineffective. People are no longer inclined to come to church, so the church must go to them.

The missional approach is actually the biblical norm. The early church didn't have buildings to attract people to. Instead, they went to people, lived among them, and became good news in their contexts. They practiced presence, proximity, and proclamation in the spaces where people lived and worked.

## Key Points

- **Direction**: Missional = going out. Attractional = expecting people to come in.

- **Focus**: Missional = joining what God is doing. Attractional = getting people to come to church.

- **Metrics**: Missional = sending and multiplication. Attractional = attendance and addition.

- **Structure**: Missional = structures that support sending. Attractional = structures that support gathering.

- **Engagement**: Missional = embedding in culture. Attractional = extracting from culture.

- **Reproduction**: Missional = multiplication. Attractional = addition.

- **Context**: Missional = becoming native. Attractional = remaining foreign.

- **Biblical norm**: Missional is the biblical norm. Attractional worked in Christendom but is increasingly ineffective.

- **Not mutually exclusive**: Some churches combine both, but missional must be primary.

## Practical Application

To move from attractional to missional, begin by shifting your understanding of mission. Recognize that God is already at work in your community, and your role is to join what God is doing rather than trying to get people to come to your building.

Shift your metrics. Instead of measuring success by Sunday attendance, measure by:
- How many people are being sent out
- How many missional communities are forming
- How the gospel is being embedded in neighborhoods and workplaces
- How relationships are forming in the community

Create structures that support sending. This might mean:
- Restructuring small groups to be missional communities
- Creating sending teams rather than just serving teams
- Developing rhythms that include both gathering and scattering
- Celebrating missional engagement, not just church attendance

Develop missional practices. Start by identifying where God is already at work in your community. Then practice presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, and proclamation in those spaces.

Recognize that the church is both gathered and scattered. We gather to be sent, not gather to stay. Gathering serves the purpose of sending, not the other way around.

Be patient. Transitioning from attractional to missional takes time. It's a fundamental shift in thinking and practice. Don't expect immediate results, but focus on being faithful in the practices.

Don't abandon gathering entirely. Missional churches still gather, but gathering serves the purpose of sending. The key is to make missional primary, not eliminate gathering.

## Examples

The early church provides an example of missional approach. They didn't have buildings to attract people to. Instead, they went to people, lived among them, and became good news in their contexts. They practiced presence, proximity, and proclamation in the spaces where people lived and worked.

The Chinese underground church demonstrates missional approach under persecution. They couldn't operate attractionally—there was no place to attract people to. Instead, they operated missionally, going to people, embedding the gospel in communities, and multiplying through relationships.

Contemporary attractional churches focus on creating excellent Sunday services, programs, and experiences. They measure success by attendance, giving, and program participation. While this can be effective in certain contexts, it becomes less effective as culture becomes more post-Christian.

Contemporary missional churches focus on sending people out and embedding the gospel in culture. They measure success by sending, multiplication, and cultural engagement. They create structures that support sending rather than just gathering.

Some churches successfully combine both approaches. They have excellent gathering experiences that attract people, but they also prioritize sending people out. The key is making missional primary, not secondary.

## Common Misunderstandings

**"Missional and attractional are mutually exclusive"**: While they represent different paradigms, some churches successfully combine both approaches. However, the missional impulse must be primary.

**"Missional means abandoning the gathered church"**: Missional churches still gather, but gathering serves the purpose of sending, not the other way around.

**"Attractional is always wrong"**: Attractional approaches can be effective in certain contexts (m0-m1), but they become less effective as culture becomes more post-Christian.

**"Missional means no programs"**: Missional churches may have programs, but programs serve the purpose of sending, not just gathering.

**"Missional is only for certain contexts"**: While missional approaches are essential in post-Christian contexts, they're actually the biblical norm.

**"Attractional is easier"**: While attractional may seem easier, it's actually less effective in post-Christian contexts and doesn't align with the biblical model.

**"Missional means no buildings"**: Missional churches may have buildings, but buildings serve the purpose of sending, not just gathering.

**"You have to choose one or the other"**: The key is making missional primary, not eliminating attractional elements entirely.
