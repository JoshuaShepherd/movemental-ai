# Organic Systems Framework: How Movements Organize Themselves

## Framework Overview

Organic Systems represent how movements organize themselves, consistent with living organisms rather than machines. This framework addresses the critical question: How do movements manage to get to scale while maintaining their core ideas/DNA? How do they maintain the core ideas and values while encouraging adaptation to local contexts? How do they pass ideas on?

The framework recognizes that structure and organization are extremely important and necessary, but they must be designed to support the mission. Over time, structures often seem to take on a life of their own and can become blockers rather than "blessers." The Organic Systems Framework provides a way to think about organization that is consistent with how God has designed life itself.

Organic systems are characterized by self-organization, adaptability, and reproducibility. They operate like living organisms—growing, responding, adapting, and reproducing. This stands in contrast to mechanistic systems that operate like machines—predictable, controllable, but ultimately lifeless and unable to adapt or reproduce organically.

The framework draws from the doctrine of creation, recognizing that organic images of the church (body, vine, tree, living temple) are more consistent with biblical revelation than mechanistic conceptions. It recognizes that the Creator has filled every aspect of creation with intrinsic vitality and design, and that this same life is found in every part of his universe.

## Component Parts

### From Monument to Movement: Metaphorically Speaking

**The Power of Metaphors**: Metaphors and symbols are not just used to illustrate an idea; they actually contain the very idea they are meant to convey. They filter and define how we see reality. If we change the primary metaphor, we then see everything in a new way.

**Institution vs. Movement**: If we suggest that the church is a religious institution, images of buildings, programs, staff, and hierarchical organization come to mind. But if we change the metaphor to movement, we see the church as more fluid, message-based, adaptive, high energy, vital, and responsive.

**The Shift**: To recover outstanding transformational movements in history, we must flip the primary metaphors of our ecclesiology from static institutional ones to the more dynamic organic-movemental ones. By changing the metaphor, we change the paradigm, and by changing the paradigm, we change the organization.

### Re-enchanting Ecclesiology: The Creator Comes to Church

**Theological Foundation**: Organic images of the church should draw their primary theological funding from the biblical doctrine of creation (cosmology) rather than from any of the other disciplines that have conventionally informed ecclesiology.

**God's Creative Fingerprints**: The Creator has filled every aspect of creation with intrinsic vitality and design. The more we learn about creation from science, the more stunningly ingenious it all seems. From quarks to supernovas, the universe declares the sheer omnipotence and omniscience of the Creator God.

**Transcendence and Immanence**: The doctrine of God's transcendence informs us that God is beyond his creation, while the doctrine of God's immanence reveals that he is also fully present in even the smallest aspects of it. The whole cosmos and life itself are directly connected to God and are expressions of his creative power.

**Organic Images**: The organic images and metaphors of church and mission found in Scripture (body, vine, tree, living temple) are more consistent with biblical revelation and God's engagement in his creation than mechanistic conceptions of church that we have devised.

### Movement Thinking: An Aspect of the Living-Systems Approach

**Living Systems**: A living-systems approach requires seeing organizations as dynamic, interconnected, and interdependent systems rather than as collections of independent parts.

**Systemic Thinking**: Understanding how systems function is important because if you fail to understand the system, you will not be able to unleash the really transformative power of movements. Each element is dynamically interrelated and interdependent, and it is the synergy that derives from interconnectedness that enables exponential expansion.

**Nonlinear Thinking**: Movement thinking requires breaking the habit of linear thinking and learning rather to think in terms of systems—where everything is dynamically and irrevocably interrelated and interdependent. Everything is happening at once, and it is the synergy that derives from interconnectedness that enables transformation.

**The Body Analogy**: The human body is a perfect example of a system. Tamper with one part, and you tamper with the whole. The heart and the circulatory system both need the other to survive and function properly.

### Essential Elements of Organic Systems

For apostolic movements to take place, all six elements of mDNA must be active in the system:

1. **Jesus Is Lord**: Radical and unwavering commitment to the Way (ethos) of the Founder Jesus at the very center of it all

2. **Disciple-Making**: Clearly articulated vision for discipleship as well as a clear process to ensure that disciple making happens throughout the organization

3. **Missional-Incarnational Impulse**: Commitment to extend the movement by going out and going deep into various cultures and interpreting the gospel in these settings

4. **APEST Culture**: Missional ministry (and by extension, leadership) equal to the task of initiating, developing, and maintaining movement

5. **Organic Systems**: System designed around internalized movement DNA, committed to empowering every agent in the system by pushing power and function to wide reproducibility and scalability

6. **Communitas**: Inbuilt culturally embedded willingness to regularly dare to take risks in the cause of the movement

Each of these elements is important on its own, but for apostolic movements to take place all six must be active in the system. Each element unlocks the possibilities of the other elements of mDNA.

### Characteristics of Organic Systems

**Self-Organization**: Organic systems are self-organizing and self-governing in whole and in part. They don't require external control to function.

**Adaptability**: Organic systems are highly adaptive, able to respond to changing conditions and contexts while maintaining core identity.

**Reproducibility**: Organic systems are designed for reproduction. Each part contains the potential of the whole, enabling exponential rather than linear growth.

**Distributed Intelligence**: Rather than centralized control, organic systems rely on distributed intelligence—every part of the system can innovate, adapt, and reproduce.

**Simple Rules**: Organic systems use core principles that guide behavior rather than complex policies and procedures. These simple rules enable adaptation while maintaining identity.

**Network Structure**: Organic systems exhibit network structures rather than hierarchical control. Power and function are pushed to the edges, enabling innovation and reproduction at every level.

**Fractal Organization**: The same patterns repeat at every scale. What works at the individual level works at the community level, which works at the movement level.

## System Dynamics

Organic systems work as an integrated system:

1. **DNA Replication**: The movement's core DNA must replicate through every level—from individual to community to network to movement. This fractal replication enables scale while maintaining identity.

2. **Adaptation and Fidelity**: Movements must balance adaptation to local contexts with fidelity to core DNA. Too much adaptation loses identity. Too much fidelity prevents contextualization.

3. **Self-Organization**: Organic systems organize themselves without external control. They respond to conditions and adapt accordingly.

4. **Distributed Intelligence**: Rather than centralized control, organic systems rely on distributed intelligence—every part of the system can innovate, adapt, and reproduce.

5. **Network Effects**: As networks grow, they create value that didn't exist before. The network itself becomes a resource, enabling connections, learning, and multiplication.

6. **Simple Rules**: Core principles guide behavior and enable adaptation while maintaining identity. Complex systems prevent adaptation and reproduction.

7. **Fractal Organization**: The same patterns repeat at every scale, enabling reproduction at every level.

## Activation Principles

Organic systems activate when:

1. **DNA is clear and replicable**: The movement's core identity and principles are clearly articulated and can be passed on.

2. **Self-organization is enabled**: Systems are designed to organize themselves without external control.

3. **Distributed intelligence is activated**: Intelligence and capacity are activated throughout the system, not just at the top.

4. **Simple rules guide behavior**: Core principles enable adaptation while maintaining identity.

5. **Network structures are in place**: Distributed, decentralized organization enables reproduction at every level.

6. **All six mDNA elements are active**: Each element unlocks the possibilities of the other elements.

What blocks activation:
- **Mechanistic thinking**: Operating through machine metaphors rather than organic ones
- **Centralized control**: Hierarchical structures that prevent distributed reproduction
- **Complex systems**: Policies and procedures that prevent adaptation
- **Lack of DNA clarity**: Unclear identity and principles that cannot be replicated
- **Institutional thinking**: Operating through institutional rather than movemental paradigms
- **Missing mDNA elements**: Not all six elements are active in the system

## Diagnostic Tools

To assess if organic systems are present and functioning:

1. **Evaluate metaphors**: Are we using organic or mechanistic metaphors?

2. **Assess self-organization**: Are systems organizing themselves, or requiring external control?

3. **Check distributed intelligence**: Is intelligence activated throughout, or concentrated at the top?

4. **Examine simple rules**: Are core principles guiding behavior, or are complex systems controlling?

5. **Look for network structures**: Is organization distributed or centralized?

6. **Assess mDNA elements**: Are all six elements active in the system?

Key questions:
- Are we using organic or mechanistic metaphors?
- Are systems organizing themselves, or requiring external control?
- Is intelligence distributed throughout, or concentrated at the top?
- Are simple rules guiding behavior, or are complex systems controlling?
- Is organization distributed or centralized?
- Are all six mDNA elements active?

## Implementation Pathways

To develop organic systems in your church or organization:

1. **Change metaphors**: Move from institutional to movemental metaphors. See the church as a movement, not an institution.

2. **Clarify DNA**: Articulate core identity and principles that can be replicated.

3. **Enable self-organization**: Design systems to organize themselves without external control.

4. **Distribute intelligence**: Activate intelligence and capacity throughout the system, not just at the top.

5. **Create simple rules**: Develop core principles that guide behavior and enable adaptation.

6. **Build network structures**: Move from hierarchical to networked organization. Push power and function to the edges.

7. **Activate all mDNA elements**: Ensure all six elements are active in the system.

8. **Think systemically**: Break the habit of linear thinking and learn to think in terms of systems.

Sequence and priorities:
- Foundation: Change metaphors and clarify DNA
- Structure: Enable self-organization and distribute intelligence
- Rules: Create simple rules that guide behavior
- Network: Build network structures
- Integration: Activate all mDNA elements
- Thinking: Develop systemic thinking

## Case Studies and Examples

**The Early Church**: Organized as a network of communities that could reproduce independently while maintaining core identity. Each community contained the potential of the whole.

**The Chinese Underground Church**: Grew from 2 million to 120 million through organic systems where any part could reproduce the whole, even without central organization.

**The Methodist Movement**: Under John Wesley, created a network structure with class meetings, bands, and circuits that enabled exponential growth through distributed reproduction.

**The Starfish and the Spirit**: Explores how movements operate as distributed networks where cutting off the head doesn't kill the movement—it creates two movements.

**Living Systems Theory**: Draws from scientific understanding of how living organisms organize themselves, adapt, and reproduce.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Mechanistic thinking**: Operating through machine metaphors rather than organic ones.

2. **Centralized control**: Maintaining hierarchical structures that prevent distributed reproduction.

3. **Complex systems**: Creating policies and procedures that prevent adaptation and reproduction.

4. **Lack of DNA clarity**: Unclear identity and principles that cannot be replicated.

5. **Institutional thinking**: Operating through institutional rather than movemental paradigms.

6. **Missing mDNA elements**: Not all six elements are active in the system.

7. **Linear thinking**: Failing to understand systems and interconnectedness.

8. **External control**: Requiring external control rather than enabling self-organization.

## Evolution and Development

The Organic Systems Framework has evolved through:

**Early Development**: First explored in *The Forgotten Ways* (2006) Chapter 9, "Organic Systems," as part of understanding how movements organize themselves.

**Expansion**: *The Permanent Revolution* (2012) and *On the Verge* (2011) expanded the framework, exploring how to transition from institutional to movemental organization.

**Deepening**: *The Starfish and the Spirit* (2019, with Lance Ford and Rob Wegner) dedicated an entire book to organic systems, exploring distributed leadership and starfish organization.

**Integration**: The framework has been integrated with:
- mDNA System (as one of the six elements)
- Movement Dynamics (as the way systems scale and multiply)
- APEST/5Q (as the ministry environment that enables organic systems)

The understanding continues to develop as organic systems are studied and as the framework is applied in diverse contexts.
