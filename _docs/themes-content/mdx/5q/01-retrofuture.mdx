# Chapter 1: RetroFuture — Biblical Foundations for a 5Q Future

> "The problem of clericalism that results from that reduction [of ministry to shepherd and teacher] … is certainly one of the major and most daunting challenges that the Western Christian movement faces as it moves out of the protections of established Christendom."

The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that we begin this journey from the same starting point.

Some readers may be new to the recovery of APEST thinking; the following summary of Ephesians 4:1–16 will provide both orientation and foundation for the paradigm that follows.

### Ephesians 4:1–16: The Key to Activating the Body of Christ

As the text that unlocks the 5Q system, Ephesians 4:1–16 is foundational for understanding the church's nature and purpose.

Ephesians is considered the spiritual template for the church, presenting God's default settings on a primordial level—what some call "the invisible church," or as Eugene Peterson refers to it, "the church we cannot see..."

## The Ever-Present Template: Sense and the Church

> *Sense is the ever-present, but largely unseen, primordial template that seeks to express itself in the life of every church, both now and throughout history.

It needs soft eyes for us to perceive its pressure and to break through our theological blind spots and our ingrained ecclesiological habits.

But it is always present, secretly exerting its pressure to conform our expressions of church to the one that Jesus intended in the first place.*

## Ephesians: Under the Hood

Eugene Peterson notes:

> *Ephesians is an inside look at what is beneath and behind and within the church that we do see wherever and whenever it becomes visible... [It] provides our best access to what is involved in the formation of church, not so much the way the church appears in our towns and cities, but the essence that is behind the appearances: God's will, Christ's presence, the Holy Spirit's work.

This… is what we simply must get through our heads if we are going to understand and participate rightly in any church that we are part of.

This is the only writing in the New Testament that provides us with such a detailed and lively account of the inside and underground workings of the complex and various profusion of 'churches' that we encounter and try to make sense of.*

He is absolutely right about the whole book; this must therefore apply equally to Ephesians 4:1–16.

This text is weighty precisely because that is exactly how Paul intended it to be read.

The language, grammar, theme, and proposed outcomes—all indicate the sheer importance of the text.

Commentators have long held that Ephesians, as a whole, is something of the constitutional document of the church.

Like all constitutions, it is meant to guide all subsequent thinking and action in the organization so constituted.

Read it with this in mind; it is meant to define our understanding of the purpose of God in the church.

By extension, constitutional theology ought to define who we are as followers of Christ, how we understand ourselves, and how we direct our affairs in the world.

## Ephesians 4:1–16 (Highlighted Excerpts)

> *As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
> 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 
> 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 
> 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
> 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
> 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all... 
> 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 
> 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. 
> 14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 
> 15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 
> 16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.*

## Thematic Structure of Ephesians 4:1–16

Three natural sections emerge within the overall unity of verses 1–16:

1. **Foundations for the Unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:1–6)** 2. **The Ascension Gifting of the Church (Ephesians 4:7–11)** 3. **Attaining Maturity and Fullness in Christ (Ephesians 4:12–16)**

---

### Foundations for the Unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:1–6)

The opening of Ephesians 4 flows from Paul's lofty prayer in 3:14–21, where he prays that the church might attain knowledge of God in Jesus Christ and grow into the fullness of Christ—a key theme of the letter.

Immediately after, Paul appeals to the Ephesians (and all Christians) to live consistent with who God is and what He has done in Jesus: to "live a life worthy of the calling we have received" (4:1).

Ephesians 4 is the pivotal section where Paul moves from theology to praxis.

Like any constitution's preamble, Paul condenses core theological essentials into seven axioms relating to the oneness of God, faith, and church: one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.

These foundational convictions hold together the identity and unity within the ever-diversifying movement described in Acts.

Yet the church has seldom lived into this calling.

Division—by race, identity, gender, slavery—has been resolved and unified in Christ, though in practice barriers remain.

The strong appeal of verses 1–16 is not to separate what God has put together, striving for unity of the Spirit.

This unity, organically connected with the diversity of the church's gifts in 7–11, includes the diverse APEST functions given by Jesus.

---

### The Ascension Gifting of the Church (Ephesians 4:7–11)

After laying the basis for unity, Paul affirms the Christ-apportioned ministry of the Body of Christ.

Jesus "gave" APEST to the church, distributing the fivefold among all people as he willed.

The Greek verb for "given" (edothe, aorist indicative of didomi) signals a decisive, once-for-all historic act with ongoing effects—much like the signing of the Declaration of Independence impacts America's self-understanding.

All five APEST ministries are bound together under the ruling verb: Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers.

The structure of the passage resists arbitrary selection or reduction among the five; none may be omitted without violating the grammar and logic of the text. APEST is thereby always an intrinsic part of the Body of Christ's genetic code—the ongoing index of Jesus' activity in his church.

Though aspects may be suppressed, their functions or potential are always already given, inextricable as long as Jesus is present.

---

### Attaining Maturity and Fullness in Christ (Ephesians 4:12–16)

Each function/calling brings something to the Body that the others do not; they mutually enrich one another.

The church always needs to be sent (Apostolic), attentive to God (Prophetic), sharing the story and inviting new life (Evangelistic), developing community (Shepherd), and rich in knowledge and wisdom (Teacher).

All are necessary.

The purpose of APEST is outlined in verses 12–16: "to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ."

This reveals the teleological (goal-oriented) nature of the fivefold ministry. APEST exists to bring the church to maturity and fullness—specifically, "the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." This is no small goal; it represents the church's ultimate destiny and purpose.

When the church operates with reduced ministry paradigms (typically just shepherd and teacher), it cannot achieve this fullness.

The missing apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic functions create systemic deficiencies that prevent the church from reaching its God-intended maturity.

## The Constitutional Nature of Ephesians 4

Understanding Ephesians 4:1–16 as constitutional theology helps us grasp its significance.

Like a national constitution, this passage:

1. **Establishes foundational principles** (unity in diversity) 2. **Defines organizational structure** (APEST ministries) 3. **Outlines ultimate purposes** (maturity and fullness in Christ) 4. **Provides ongoing guidance** for all subsequent church life and ministry When churches ignore or reduce this constitutional framework, they operate outside their God-given design.

The result is institutional dysfunction, spiritual immaturity, and mission ineffectiveness.

---

## Sense: The Ever-Present Template

What I call "Sense" is this ever-present, primordial template of APEST that seeks expression in every church throughout history.

Even when suppressed or unrecognized, Sense exerts pressure on the church to conform to Jesus' original design.

This explains why:
- Churches often struggle with identity and purpose when operating with reduced ministry paradigms
- Revival movements typically rediscover apostolic and prophetic functions
- Healthy churches naturally develop all five APEST functions, even if they don't use that language
- The church feels most alive and effective when all five ministries are active

Sense is not human invention but divine design—the ongoing fruit of Christ's ascension gifts to his church.

Learning to perceive and respond to Sense is crucial for church renewal and mission effectiveness.

## Breaking Through Theological Blind Spots

Our inherited theological frameworks often create blind spots that prevent us from seeing APEST clearly.

Common reductions include:

**The Pastoral Paradigm:** Reducing ministry to shepherd and teacher functions, creating a care-and-instruction model that lacks missional dynamism.

**The Clerical System:** Professionalizing ministry in ways that separate clergy from laity, rather than equipping all God's people for ministry.

**The Corporate Model:** Adopting business management structures that prioritize efficiency over spiritual vitality and mission effectiveness.

**The Academic Bias:** Over-emphasizing teaching functions while neglecting apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic callings.

These reductions, while often well-intentioned, create systemic barriers to the church's full expression of its APEST nature.

Overcoming them requires both theological reflection and practical restructuring of church life and ministry.

## Implications for Church Leadership

If Ephesians 4:1–16 truly represents the church's constitutional DNA, then church leaders must:

1. **Recognize all five APEST functions** as legitimate and necessary expressions of Christ's ongoing ministry 2. **Assess current ministry paradigms** against the full APEST spectrum 3. **Identify gaps and suppressions** in their church's expression of fivefold ministry 4. **Develop strategies for activation** of dormant or missing APEST functions 5. **Create organizational cultures** that welcome and support diverse ministry callings

This is not about wholesale replacement of existing structures, but rather about expanding and enriching them to better align with biblical design.

---

## The Promise of Restoration

The recovery of APEST thinking is not merely academic or organizational—it holds promise for the church's spiritual renewal and mission effectiveness.

When churches begin to operate according to their constitutional design:

- **Unity increases** as diversity is properly channeled
- **Maturity develops** as all necessary functions contribute to growth
- **Mission effectiveness** improves as apostolic and evangelistic gifts are activated
- **Spiritual vitality** rises as prophetic sensitivity and pastoral care work together
- **Wisdom multiplies** as teaching gifts operate within a fuller ministry ecosystem The church's future depends not on new innovations but on returning to its original design—the ever-present template of APEST that Jesus gave his church through his ascension gifts.
