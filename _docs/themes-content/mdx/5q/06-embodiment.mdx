# Chapter 6: Embodiment—The Fivefold Modes of Jesus' Presence in the Church

> In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.

The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.
>
> —Hebrews 1:1–3

> The church is empowered by a certain communion with Christ which allows some measure of his perfected spirituality and destiny to be repeated or re-enacted in our lives.
>
> —George Hunsinger

> This distribution of royal gifts and ministries [APEST] is not a substitute for the Messiah’s presence but the mode of his being present.
>
> —Markus Barth

Thus far, we have focused on one aspect of Jesus’ work—establishing and equipping his people for their mission in the world.

Paul’s teaching on recapitulation (anakephalaiosis) reveals how Jesus establishes the fivefold at the church’s core, but more must be said about his defining role in the ecclesia.

We look to Jesus to know who we are and what we are called to do.

The church’s existence, identity, purpose, and function are all inseparably linked to who Jesus is and what he has done.

As Bonhoeffer reminds us:

> Action in accord with Christ does not originate in some ethical principle, but in the very person of Jesus Christ.

This is because everything real is summed up in Christ, who, by definition, is the origin of any and all action that is in accord with reality.

New Testament faith is about the unfolding purposes in Christ—Head and Body.

The Holy Spirit enables faith to become "living and personal," rooted in the Person of Jesus Christ, and encompassing all he gives to his people as gifts.

Jesus is God’s agenda for the church and world.

He reconstitutes the world in his lived life, resulting in his church—the humanity God intended.

As the people defined by Jesus, we must continually realign with our Founder, Lord, and Redeemer.

## Jesus: The Agenda of the Church

Beyond affirming core Christological beliefs (his divinity, incarnation, exemplary life, redemptive death, resurrection, ascension, and promised return), we must examine how the aspects of Jesus’ person and work directly relate to his people, the Body of Christ.

Paul writes:

> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.

For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.

He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
>
> —Colossians 1:13–20

This comprehensive language—firstborn, head, supremacy, all things—gives us a vision of the universal and cosmic significance of Jesus.

The church is not merely an effect of Christ; she is his fullness and Body.

Encountering Christ the Head includes encountering the Body—the two are indivisible.

Stanley Hauerwas states:

> The whole life of Jesus is to be understood as determinative for the whole life of the church.

Therefore, the church’s very culture and function must mirror Christ.

Dysfunction in the church often stems from a lack of focus on Jesus.

The life of the church must be directly conformed to the life and teaching of Jesus, as the archetype to which we are being conformed (cf.

Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

George Beasley-Murray summarizes:

> The apostles were commissioned to carry on Christ’s work, and not to begin a new one.

## The Five Identities/Purposes of Jesus

Having established the centrality of Jesus, we now examine his ministry through the APEST categories, observing how he both fulfills and redefines them.

These are best seen as five core identities or divine personas that Jesus reconstitutes and imparts to his people.

### 1.

Jesus as the Exemplary Apostle

The term apostle (from *apostello*) means "one who is sent," an empowered, ambassadorial agent acting on behalf of a sender.

Jesus claimed this identity, experiencing himself as sent by the Father to fulfill God’s eternal purposes (see John 20:21; Hebrews 3:1).

He is the great Founder-Leader, sparking a movement of world redemption.

His apostolic dimension touches on the purpose and mission of God in the world.

### 2.

Jesus as the Exemplary Prophet

Walter Brueggemann calls Jesus “the fulfillment and quintessence of the prophetic tradition.” Jesus announces the "fulfillment of time," brings God’s judgment and salvation, restates covenant, and calls for repentance and faithfulness (see Mark 1:15; Luke 4:14-20).

He is the Word of God incarnate (John 1:1–14), the Faithful One, perfectly obedient, and the perfect example of prophecy.

### 3.

Jesus as the Exemplary Evangelist

Though less commonly highlighted, Jesus as evangelist is a clear aspect of his ministry.

He proclaims and demonstrates the good news of the Kingdom.

He offers every person and community an opportunity for radical reorientation, seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:9–10).

Jesus is both proclaimer and content of the evangel—he is the good news (Ephesians 2:14).

### 4.

Jesus as the Exemplary Shepherd

Jesus is our High Priest, mediator, and the true Shepherd of Israel (2 Samuel 5:2; John 10).

He heals, reconciles, and builds a new community (ecclesia), sustaining and guiding his people in love and compassion (e.g., 1 Peter 2:25; Matthew 28:20).

### 5.

Jesus as the Exemplary Teacher

Historically regarded as Rabbi and Teacher, Jesus embodies the Way, teaching through example and life.

He is the Word made flesh, the fulfillment and redefinition of the Torah (see Matthew 5:17; John 1:17, 14:6).

In him "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:2–3).

## APEST: The Onefold Medium of the Fivefold Message

Jesus is the exemplar of each APEST ministry.

All five motifs are essential to understanding his life.

In him, the medium truly is the message: He embodies the fullness of APEST in its perfected form, the defining fractal of the system.

When we examine Jesus:

- **As Apostle:** Sent, representing the Father, founder of the church.
- **As Prophet:** Word made flesh, obedient Son, herald of the New Covenant.
- **As Evangelist:** Good News incarnate, redeemer, movement maker.
- **As Shepherd:** Good Shepherd, reconciler, healer, defender.
- **As Teacher:** Logos, guide, wisdom of God, revelation and light.

These fivefold motifs are core to his ministry and together comprise his identity.

The New Testament gospel integrates all these motifs—mission, prophetic call, proclamation of good news, adoption into God's family, and access to true knowledge—because they are first present in Jesus himself. 5Q is thus an index of the manifestation of his presence in his people; Jesus is the key that unlocks the power of 5Q as its defining center.

## Bringing the Head and the Body into Alignment

The remainder of this book will make the case for why the 5Q system is essential for renewal in church ministry and how it can be deeply coded into your church or organization.

Christian ministry derives its authority and authenticity from its foundation in Jesus Christ.

The church is not only God’s redeemed people, but also the human agency by which Jesus extends his ministry into the world.

The Body of Christ is the living expression of Jesus’ ongoing work.

## The Body Metaphor: Connecting Christ and His People

Paul's "Body of Christ" metaphor is critical for understanding the nature of the relationship between Christ and his people, as well as how 5Q is embedded into the church’s "genetic code." This metaphor requires us to "live into" its implications, making us more responsive to Christ.

The indissoluble association between Christ and the Church is captured in the language: Christ//Body of Christ; Messiah//Messianic; Christ//Christian.

Hans Urs von Balthasar notes:

> While the church is not Christ, she can claim for herself and for the world no other pattern than the pattern of Christ, which leaves its stamp in her and shapes her through and through.

### The Incarnational Implication

Dietrich Bonhoeffer described the church as "the form of Christ in the world." Jesus was "God with skin"; now we are called to "flesh out" what Jesus is like.

The church is the real presence of Christ in the world, a living sign of Jesus' activity.

George Hunsinger writes:

> The church is empowered by a certain communion with Christ which allows some measure of his perfected spirituality and destiny to be repeated or re-enacted in our lives.

Augustine is ascribed this saying:

> A Christian is: a mind through which Christ thinks, a heart through which Christ loves, a voice through which Christ speaks, and a hand through which Christ helps.

### Christ as Head of the Body

The Body of Christ belongs to Jesus; he is its Head and the source of its character.

Frank Viola identifies five aspects of Christ’s headship:

1. **Jesus expresses his character and nature through his Body** 2. **Jesus continues his earthly ministry through the church** 3. **Jesus directs the church and its mission** 4. **Jesus nourishes his Body** 5. **Jesus is the source of the church’s life** The church's agency and mission are bound to the person and work of Jesus.

She is the concentrated expression of a culture birthed and sustained in Christ.

### Ministry Modeled on Jesus

All authentic ministry originates with, is shaped by, and is modeled on Jesus.

Karl Barth called the church "the earthly-historical form of Christ’s existence," necessitating conformity to the life of her Founder.

### The Body as Symphony

Paul envisions the church as a symphony—many parts working together synergistically (cf.

Ephesians 4).

The Body is designed for fullness, maturity, perfection, and love.

The church needs all of its parts to function as Christ intends.

### Agency and Function

A body exists to extend the purposes of its head.

Similarly, the church is the receptacle of Christ’s power and represents him on earth.

Tim Keller summarizes:

> Jesus Christ has all the powers and functions of ministry in himself; it is this ministry that is distributed in and through his church.

The Body of Christ is designed to extend the purposes of Jesus.

## Making APEST Unavoidable in the Life of the Body of Christ

The direct correspondence between Christ and the Body is reinforced by the sociological theory of the "routinization of charisma" (Max Weber).

All movements begin with a charismatic founder, but for the movement to survive, the founder’s charisms must be distributed and embedded throughout the organization.

Applied to Ephesians 4, by recapitulating and bequeathing APEST, Jesus routinizes his ministry and identity into the ecclesia’s foundation.

---

## Case Study: John Wesley

John Wesley, one of history’s remarkable movement makers, exemplifies high 5Q capacities.

Wesley was:

- **Apostolic:** Movement starter and adaptive system builder.
- **Prophetic:** Advocate for social and personal holiness, abolition of slavery, workers’ rights.
- **Evangelistic:** Tireless preacher, mass communicator.
- **Shepherding:** Created systems of care for the poor and broken.
- **Teaching:** Committed to discipleship and prolific in teaching.

Wesley’s remarkable influence stemmed from embodying all five APEST functions.

However, many Wesleyan denominations have since suppressed parts of APEST, leading to decline—the fatal flaw of "un-routinizing" founding charisms.

> Wesley is only a pale reflection of the original fivefold template exemplified in Jesus, the real Founder of the Christian movement.

Wesley’s legitimacy stemmed from mirroring Jesus’ fullness in APEST.

A contemporary example is Pope Francis, who exhibits all five APEST functions; his renewal of the church reflects their ongoing necessity.

---

*The discussion continues with further exploration of the embodiment of APEST in the Body of Christ and the implications for renewal and mission.*

*Note: The original text contained complex footnote references and figure numbers.

For clarity, these were omitted from the main body but should be properly referenced and/or cross-linked in a published edition.*

## Embodying APEST in the Catholic Church

The challenge for the Catholic Church is whether or not Pope Francis’s particular embodiment of APEST will be recognized as such and adopted more fully within the institution.

Only then may the current renewal be “routinized” and extended beyond his papacy.

---

## Let Me Hear Your Body Talk

As both Founder and Designer, Jesus provides the exemplary pattern of behavior against which all corresponding models, patterns of discipleship, ministry, and leadership in the movement are to be measured.

He models the humanity and service by which all disciples are to be evaluated and legitimized.

In other words, Jesus is our spiritual template—a pattern, that, once discovered, helps us better understand ourselves and others.

And here’s the critical point in relation to 5Q:

> **Jesus’ person and work are the perfect embodiments of APEST.**

Conformity to Christ in the Body of Christ must, therefore, mirror the fivefold nature of Christ’s ministry if it is to be authentic ministry.

Likewise, the fivefold must feature in individual discipleship because discipleship is essentially formation in Christ.

To mature into a Christlike person means engaging all the elements of the fivefold latent in our relationship with Jesus.

The idea of becoming like Jesus lies at the heart of all genuine spirituality and discipleship.

The imitation of Christ can take the form of the imitation of the fivefold as expressed in Him—disciples follow their master in all things (Luke 6:40).

One of the most clarifying definitions of ministry is:

> **Doing the kind of things Jesus did, for the same reasons He did them.**

Think of this in terms of the fivefold.

---

## The Church’s Inheritance: APEST from Christ

So, how does the fivefold ministry of Christ get into the church?

To answer this, recall the primary imagery of Ephesians 4:1–16.

In His ascension, Jesus “has given” (vv. 7, 11) to His Body its inherent callings and functions so that the church, through APEST, may mature (vv. 13, 15) and “attain to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (v. 13).

In other words:

> **APEST is not only the mode of Jesus’ presence among His people; He gives APEST to the church so that she might grow, mature, and attain to the fullness of Christ.**

---

## The Ministry of Christ in the Body of Christ

Perhaps the central idea of Ephesians 4:1–16 can be portrayed as:

> **Ministry of Christ given to the Body of Christ, forming the Image of Christ in all.**

There are significant implications for you and your church or organization.

This is a Yoda moment: pay attention to the following logic.

- Jesus lives, fulfills, and exemplifies the APEST types.
- In His ascension, He confers these now-redeemed and perfected APEST functions to the Body of Christ.
- The intention: these functions are to be expressed throughout the church’s life and discipleship.

Thus, the ministry of Christ is given to the Body so the Body might attain Christ’s fullness.

---

### The Problem of Truncation

If we accept the logic of 5Q thus far—and accept that the core purpose of the church is to extend both the meaning and impact of Jesus in the world—then we must honestly answer:

**Can we extend Jesus’ ministry if we are only operating in a truncated, twofold (ST) form of ministry?** 
If Jesus clearly operated as APEST, do we really think we can extend His impact with less?

Tampering with the APEST typologies diminishes our capacity to be faithful witnesses.

New Testament ministry in the Body of Christ cannot be done with anything less than all the dimensions inherent in Christ’s own ministry.

Without full APEST expression, a church cannot expect to extend Jesus’ ministry, attain Christ’s fullness, or fulfill its mission—it will inevitably have dangerous gaps in its culture.

Much of the church’s dysfunction stems from trying to extend Jesus’ ministry with only two of his at-least-five functions.

> Many dysfunctions can be traced to one or more fivefold functions being absent from the equation.

Conversely, restoring APEST is almost a silver bullet in the renewal and mission of the church—because Jesus really is the answer to all our problems.

Restoring mature APEST functionality brings life-changing renewal to your ministry, your church, or your organization.

## APEST: Archetypes and Patterns

Let these images and ideas resonate:

- **Archetypes, Latent patterns, Instincts**
- **Heroic expressions in culture & history**
- **Functions, Purposes (Implicit)**
- **Callings, Identities (Explicit)**
- **Completed in Christ’s Kingdom** (Ephesians 1:22–23)
- **Grounded in God** (Romans 11:36)
- **Reconstituted in Jesus**

Recall the key graphic introduced in chapter two.

With new eyes, you can now see the elegance and genius in the fractal pattern rooted in the Godhead and bestowed on the church (and creation) as fivefold functions and callings.

Feel the theological weight and the internal pressure of 5Q, derived from its latent presence, as Jesus presses us to conform to the logic and pattern of his own ministry.

This is something of an answer to the missional crisis facing the Western church.

The time has come to awaken it in your life and community.

These functions are irrevocably given by Christ; they cannot be removed, even if some would wish it otherwise.

Moreover, the fivefold functions are identifiable, measurable, and developable.

Any adjustments—positive or negative—will have exponential impact throughout the system.

---

## The Stakes of Fivefold Health

It is vital to begin examining the nature of fivefold functions and callings, and the fruitfulness of focusing on them.

The health of the church, its capacity for ministry, and its overall maturity depend on a correct appropriation of APEST typologies.
