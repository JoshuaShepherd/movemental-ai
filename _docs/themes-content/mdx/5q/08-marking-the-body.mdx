# Chapter 8: Marking the Body

> "People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete—the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are."
>
> —Peter Drucker

> "All our ecclesiologies are inadequate and out of date.
>
> Nearly all of them have been constructed in the light of a static concept of the Church as something given, something which already exists.
>
> Much attention has been concentrated on external 'marks of the Church.' ...
>
> As far as I know, no one has yet set to work to think out the theology of the Church in terms of the one thing for which it exists."
>
> —Bishop Stephen Neill

> "Church is not what we do; it is what God does, although we participate in it."
>
> —Eugene H. Peterson

## Seeing the Unseen: The Problem of Awareness

David Foster Wallace described two young fish unaware of the water they swim in, illustrating how the most fundamental realities are often the hardest to perceive or articulate.

Similarly, Christians often struggle to define "church" beyond simplistic or institutional descriptions.

This lack of awareness reveals both a loss of biblical identity and the restrictive effects of reductionist traditions.

## APEST as the Marks of a True Church

The fivefold typology, rooted in the ministry of Jesus and the design of the Church, offers a robust way of identifying and measuring church maturity and effectiveness.

### When Is a Church a Church?

- What observable, defining characteristics distinguish a gathering as an authentic church?
- How do we move beyond institutional or programmatic markers to something more biblically substantial?

Marks (notae ecclesiae) are the observable, measurable characteristics that distinguish the ecclesia from other communities.

Authentic worship, mission, covenant-faithfulness, and gospel-centeredness must be present and visible.

## Critique of Traditional Marks

### Catholic Tradition

- **Marks:** One, holy, catholic, apostolic
- **Drawbacks:** Tied to specific institutional forms (hierarchy, sacraments, magisterium)

### Protestant Tradition

- **Marks:** Right preaching of the Word and administration of sacraments (sometimes church discipline)
- **Drawbacks:** Reductive, focused on programs, dependent on clergy, institutionalizes grace, excludes key New Testament functions (e.g., mission, community, justice)

These reduced visions have shaped both internal and external perceptions of church, resulting in stunted, clerical, and often lifeless expressions.

## Toward Fivefold Marks: Reclaiming the Fullness

If Christ is the ultimate standard, and if the fivefold functions are the means by which his ministry extends through the church, then maturity and authenticity are found in the active presence of all five.

### The Fivefold Marks of the Church

The true church is:

1. **Founded on Christ’s Presence:** The people called, sanctified, and redeemed by God through Jesus Christ.

All other marks flow from this "meta-mark." 2. **Apostolic:** A missional people, engaging in God’s redemptive work.

Churches that live apostolically are authentically church. 3. **Prophetic:** A holy people, calling all to faithfulness, justice, worship, and prayer.

The prophetic ministry ensures the church stands for God’s covenant. 4. **Evangelistic:** Proclaimers and embodiments of the gospel, bringing salvation’s good news into the world. 5. **Shepherding:** A reconciled family, nurturing faithful community and displaying the transforming power of resurrection life. 6. **Teaching:** Lovers of wisdom and truth, nurturing understanding, and communicating God’s knowledge for life.

> "Wherever the marks are recognizably present—missional impact, covenant faithfulness, gospel proclamation, reconciled community, and deep wisdom—there you have a real, authentic church.

This is church as Jesus meant it to be!"

### Maturity through Integration

The more that each of the five marks is integrated and present, the more the community manifests the fullness of Christ.

Spiritual maturity is achieved as all five functions intersect and mutually inform one another.

> "Maturity is increasingly experienced as all five increasingly intersect and mutually inform each other, thus experiencing the systemic synergy of a truly functional Body."

## Dysfunction and Its Results

Neglect or suppression of one or more marks leads to dysfunction, such as:
- Churches lacking the prophetic mark may become complicit in injustice.
- Churches that ignore the apostolic call may become static institutions.
- Churches without genuine shepherding become toxic and unloving.

Authenticity and faithfulness increase with the proportional demonstration of all five marks.

## Diagnosis and Strategy: The 5Q Systems Test

The fivefold marks serve as both metrics and diagnostic tools.

Like an MRI for organizations, a thorough APEST profile enables leaders to:

1.

Identify strengths and deficiencies 2.

Set leadership and organizational strategies 3.

Allocate resources toward neglected functions 4.

Foster holistic maturity and health in the Body

**Action Steps:**
- Assess APEST expression in your community.
- Develop areas of weakness with contextual tools and methods.
- Celebrate and repeat progress in integration.

## Fivefold Instinct and Practice

Just as a child’s innate human potential unfolds with nurture, so every church contains the latent DNA for fivefold ministry.

With intentional discipleship, practice, and leadership, the fivefold gifts can be awakened, reshaping culture, structures, and mission.

### Communities of Practice

APEST is best learned and embodied not only by teaching, but by communal practice—through habits, behaviors, and new mental models.

Discipleship is participation in the way of Jesus, and the fivefold system offers a comprehensive framework for this journey.

## Levels of Change

1. **Discipleship Level:** Individuals discern and practice their fivefold calling through new habits and language. 2. **Church/Organizational Level:** Leaders embed APEST into the church’s rhythms, structures, and organizational culture. 3. **Systemic/Denominational Level:** Permission and strategy are granted for system-wide adoption and experimentation.

Developments at each level involve:
- Enlivening lost truths
- Legitimizing new concepts
- Repenting of obsolete frameworks
- Embracing change and risk
- Celebrating progress

This holistic rescripting of church life is essential for maturity, authenticity, and lasting missional impact.

*This chapter draws on the conviction that Jesus has given His church all it needs—that the fivefold ministry is latent in every congregation, waiting only for the Spirit’s awakening and the community’s faithful stewardship.*

## Embedding APEST in Church Life: Tools, Practices, and Processes

> _“We arrive in the parking lot and think, ‘How did I get here?’ It becomes automatic and unconscious.”_

According to Paul, the wholesale recalibration of the church and its ministry along APEST lines means that God’s people—now and everywhere—might _“attain to the fullness of Christ”_ and become mature.

Maturity is attained through decisive, meaningful, and habitual actions, even when conditions are difficult and old habits come all too easily.

Paul helped Timothy _“learn to drive”_ (cf. 1 Corinthians 4:17), and much is at stake—much more than simply learning to drive—so keep trying.

What follows are suggested tools, practices, and processes for embedding different aspects of the fivefold system (APEST) at the individual, local, and system levels.

## The 5Q Toolbox

Much of this book focuses on aligning our minds and the organizations we lead with the pattern of 5Q, a structure we've traced through theology, culture, history, Christ, and his people.

While ideas are essential to human consciousness, transformation happens less by cogent arguments and more by generating new practices that shift the experience of reality.

To make ideas impactful, we must embed them into the rhythms and habits of the community—through common tools and practices.

### What is a Tool?

A _tool_ is a mental device or physical implement used for a specific operation necessary in a vocation or profession.

Just as a saw is for cutting wood and a hammer is for driving nails, each tool discussed here is designed to deliver a particular result.

Created by myself and my 5Qcollective colleague Rich Robinson, each suggested tool produces a specific impact.

A skilled craftsman knows which tool to use for a given task based on the desired outcome.

Each tool in this chapter focuses on a unique dimension of APEST, so I highly recommend trying as many as possible.

Each will prove useful at different times and in various parts of the process—try them with your teams.

> Remember: all five functions or callings are seeds latent within the system.

Like the potential for a tree within a seed, our role is to cultivate an environment where the seed can flourish.

These tools and processes offer simple ways to create that environment.

**Warning:** Before starting any exercise below, ensure each group member understands the basic definitions and distinctions of the fivefold functions/callings.

For instance, don’t confuse evangelistic work with apostolic work simply because it seems entrepreneurial—entrepreneurial skills can serve any of the fivefold functions.

Likewise, preaching (usually associated with the pulpit) is just a medium; APEST is the message.

Be clear about definitions and distinctions upfront.

## The 5Q Systems Tests

There are two tests to help diagnose and assess the quotient of 5Q in your organization:

1. **5Q Diagnostic Test** A straightforward assessment of current capacities in relation to APEST.

It can be used multiple times to provide a diagnostic overview, similar to the “APEST marks” diagrams illustrated in chapter eight (p. 138).

This helps leaders assess strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies accordingly.

2. **5Q Systems Test** A more in-depth analysis measuring organizational awareness in relation to APEST.

Based on stages of maturity and learning, it offers both a diagnostic and a complex multidimensional view, indicating the depth of both perception and practice.

Both tests evaluate organizational functionality.

_I suggest starting with the diagnostic test.

Once people are familiar with 5Q thinking, proceed to the systems test.

Access these tests at [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com) or [5Qtests.com](http://www.5qtests.com)._

Additionally, Jessie and I have written an accessible book for non-specialists—**Activating 5Q: A User’s Guide to Understanding and Applying 5Q in Your Church or Organization**—which helps church leaders grasp the importance of testing and interpreting 5Q results. I recommend this book for all church staff and volunteers seeking to activate 5Q.
