## Personal APEST Portrait

This tool focuses on developing an individual “portrait” or profile of each person’s calling by ranking APEST functions in descending order.

The most statistically reliable method is to take the online test at [aptest.org](http://www.apest.org) (also accessible via [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com)).

However, a communal discernment process is equally enriching. I highly recommend both the test and the group process.

**Before coming together as a group, each member should:**

- Reflect personally on their APEST giftings (Ephesians 4:7).
- Using the agreed definitions (see page 99), identify their primary or dominant calling and secondary calling.
- Fill out the provided diagram: place your primary APEST gifting in the largest circle, the secondary in the next largest, and so on.
- Reflect on life events that connect to your profile.
- After filling in the circles, take the online test to confirm or refine your impressions.
- Journal insights to share with the group.

**When gathering as a group:**

- Provide up to 30 minutes for each member to share their portrait, feelings, and rationale.
- The leader should model this first.
- The group gives honest, loving feedback: is the portrait accurate?

Can the community confirm or help refine the individual’s depiction?
- Adjust the portrait as appropriate.
- Pray for and affirm each person's calling, encouraging greater self-awareness and impact.

> _“APEST is called a Body dynamic.

We only truly know ourselves in relation to others—in community.”_

## APEST Thinking Hats

Inspired by Edward de Bono's _Six Thinking Hats_, this exercise teaches teams to approach problems through the lens of each APEST function, without labeling people vocationally.

**Process:**

1.

Define a team problem. 2.

Work through the five thinking hats, each representing an APEST function: - **A (Apostle):** Missional extension, guarding the gospel, multiplication. - **P (Prophet):** Truth-telling, cultural depth. - **E (Evangelist):** Sharing the gospel, engaging outsiders. - **S (Shepherd):** Caring, nurturing, inclusion. - **T (Teacher):** Systematic truth, wisdom. 3.

Each member must think from each perspective, regardless of their own vocational gift. 4.

As a group, take turns wearing each conceptual hat and explore solutions accordingly.

_The game-like quality removes defensiveness and ensures all perspectives are heard._

## Base and Phase

This tool helps individuals identify both their primary ("base") APEST gifting and the "phases" in which they have functioned in other APEST roles.

**Process:**

- **Base:** Your primary, most comfortable ministry gifting.
- **Phase:** Other APEST roles you have operated in during different seasons, often prompted by circumstances or God’s guidance.

Paul says the purpose of APEST is equipping for maturity (see Ephesians 4:12).

Everyone is encouraged to grow beyond their base, embracing other functions for well-rounded maturity.

**Exercise:**

- Place your base ministry in the center of a diagram.
- Note phases of ministry experience in the surrounding circles.
- Briefly describe your growth experiences related to each phase.

_We are rarely in control of which phase we enter; circumstances or relationships often guide this.

Remain open to new phases and seek out opportunities to learn from others._

## APEST Inventory

The APEST Inventory helps churches and organizations inventory their activities and functions through the fivefold lens.

**Steps:**

1.

Review the functions list (see page 99). 2.

List all major activities of the church/organization. 3. **Tag** each activity as: - A (Apostolic) - P (Prophetic) - E (Evangelistic) - S (Shepherd) - T (Teacher) You can apply primary and secondary tags (e.g., “Ea” for evangelistic primary, apostolic secondary). 4.

Chart these on a visual diagram. 5.

Assess concentrations, deficiencies, and overall symmetry or asymmetry in the system. 6.

Discuss causes and ways to fill gaps.

_Some churches, like Northwood Baptist Church, have cell groups check off activities related to all five functions during the year to cultivate balanced, mature ecclesias._

## APEST Perspectives

This tool encourages teams to approach topics through multiple fivefold perspectives.

**Process:**

1.

Place an object, idea, or challenge (e.g., "gospel", "church", "culture") at the center. 2.

Each participant describes what they see from their dominant APEST profile. 3.

Group discussion reveals different facets, emphasizing the necessity of multiple perspectives for a full, accurate understanding.

_Use this tool for core values, problem-solving, planning, communication, or strategy building._

## APEST Pipeline

This exercise helps teams paint a picture of a competent practitioner of each of the five APEST callings and map processes for discipleship.

**Steps:**

1.

Profile the ideal attitude, behaviors, skills, and competencies for each APEST calling. 2.

Consider potential blockages or challenges for each in the training process. 3.

Develop curriculum/content and a model process for discipling others into these callings. 4.

Articulate core competencies required to "graduate" to the next level. 5.

Transfer theory through coaching and practice to mastery.

**Leadership Development Levels:**

- **Level Five:** Mature, able to equip others.
- **Level Four:** Able to lead.
- **Level Three:** Able to fulfill all basic tasks.
- **Level Two:** Personal awareness of vocation.
- **Level One:** The undefined disciple.

This approach supports tailored but not individualistic development—always with the goal of organizational maturity.

**Example (Levels Two & Three):**

- **Apostle:** Mobilize action, pioneer new missional frontiers, focus on impact.
- **Prophet:** Help hear and know truth, foster cultural integrity, focus on faithfulness.
- **Evangelist:** Encourage gospel sharing, equip others, focus on communication.
- **Shepherd:** Nurture, demonstrate God’s love, focus on inclusion.
- **Teacher:** Create depth and accessibility in truth, focus on learning.

## APEST Training Environments

To engage with 5Q on an organizational level, consider the three primary training environments:

1. **Classroom** Structured teaching on APEST callings and functions.

2. **Apprenticeship** Relational training, where more mature leaders apprentice others in the same or different APEST callings.

3. **Immersion** Experiential learning by entering environments where a particular function is dominant or where there is a healthy fivefold balance.

_Utilizing all three is vital for fruitful development of leaders in a 5Q environment._

---

## Assessing APEST Culture

A healthy 5Q culture requires attention to both structure and culture.

**Levels of APEST Culture:**

1. **Grounded:** Are all five functions understood? 2. **Holistic:** Are all five present? 3. **Balanced:** Are all five working together? 4. **Fruitful:** Are all five accessing synergy and leveraging strengths? 5. **Multiplying:** Are all five recreating themselves?

A healthy culture will show all five layers and move the organization—together—toward maturity.

## From Knowledge to Discipleship

Biblical teaching emphasizes not just knowing about God, but knowing God—and obedience is the sign of true understanding (Matthew 7:26; James 1:23).

This obedience and imitation leads to discipleship:

> _“As Jesus’ disciple, I am his apprentice in kingdom living. I am learning from him how to lead my life in the Kingdom of the Heavens as he would lead my life if he were I.”_

We have been given APEST by Jesus to mature and attain his fullness.

It is not enough to acknowledge the fivefold as good theology; we must commit ourselves to this logic and let it shape the Body.
