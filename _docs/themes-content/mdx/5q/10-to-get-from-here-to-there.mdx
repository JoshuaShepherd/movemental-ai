# Chapter 10: To Get From Here to There

## Learning by Process, Not Just by Answers

We often want quick answers, but transformation requires learning the process, not just arriving at the right answer.

As illustrated in teaching a child math: it's more valuable to show the process than to simply supply the answer.

Apply this lesson to church leadership: lasting, fruitful change comes by embracing new theological paradigms and praxis, not just programs or manuals.

Changing structures may take months; changing culture takes years—and it starts with us.

## Embracing Change: The Challenge

As you reflect on what you’ve learned, ask these key questions:

- Are you willing to relinquish the security of old thinking and adopt "soft eyes"?
- Will you courageously change, not just personally but communally and organizationally?
- Are you willing to pay the price to “learn again”?

The first step on this journey is repentance—a willingness to expand your thinking and adopt new truth.

## Stop, Look, Listen

Repentance is more than turning from sin; it means to "open your mind" or "expand your thinking" (Mark 1:15).

Like the Green Cross Code in England:
**Stop, Look, and Listen** before responding to new situations or information.

- **Stop:** Pause your rush to act or to resist new ideas.
- **Look:** Observe your context, yourself, and others with fresh eyes.
- **Listen:** Be attentive to how God may be speaking or leading.

After reflection, step out and act on the new truth—"believe the good news." Learning means not just understanding, but applying, innovating, and multiplying (per Bloom's taxonomy).

**5Q Challenge:** 
Write in your journal, reflect, pray, walk, read—do what you need to Stop, Look, and Listen for God’s truth.

Ask:

- What is God saying to expand your thinking?
- Where are you stuck or have settled for less?
- How can this new understanding help you or others grow?

## Steps for the 5Q Journey

The journey of living out 5Q is not for the faint-hearted; it is stretching and rewarding.

Here are key ways to begin:

### 1.

Be Like a Child

Approach learning and challenge with childlike curiosity and faith—a spirit of exploration and experimentation, not rigid classroom learning.

Children engage fully, learn through experience, and maintain "soft eyes" that see possibilities.

### 2.

Be a Padawan

Embrace the posture of an apprentice.

Like the disciples who learned by watching and following their teacher, we must move beyond information transfer to personal, relational, and experiential learning.

### 3.

Be a Long-Distance Runner

Transformation results from repeated, intentional practice:

- **Discipline**: Do new things intentionally, even if it feels awkward.
- **Habit**: Continued practice becomes your default pattern.
- **Lifestyle**: Eventually, right practices become second nature—unconsciously competent.

### 4.

Be an Explorer

An explorer relies on:

- **A Map:** Understanding and orientation (theory and information from this book).
- **A Guide:** A mentor who has journeyed before.
- **A Destination:** A compelling vision.
- **A Compass:** The Holy Spirit guiding direction and pace.

### 5.

Be an Architect

Long-term change requires building strong foundations.

Consider the five marks of the church (chapter eight):

- Missional impact (A)
- Covenant faithfulness (P)
- Gospel proclamation (E)
- Reconciled community (S)
- Deep wisdom (T)

Intentionally engage and grow in all five marks, set solid foundations, and seek out "master builders" to deepen your competencies.

## Final Encouragements

1. **Start Small:** Don't be overwhelmed. Begin with one or two sustainable steps.

2. **Journey with Others:** Don't travel alone. Identify mentors and companions for prayer, encouragement, and accountability.

3. **Stay Connected:** Engage with others journeying with 5Q through resources and training via [5Qcentral.com](http://www.5qcentral.com).

And the end of all our exploring 
Will be to arrive where we started 
And know the place for the first time.”_
