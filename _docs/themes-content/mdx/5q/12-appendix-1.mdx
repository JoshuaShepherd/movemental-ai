## Appendix 1: The Cessation of Cessationism

Cessationists believe that the fivefold (especially apostolic and prophetic) functions ceased with the establishment of the New Testament canon and church hierarchy.

However:

- **Scripture Writers:** Only a handful of the original apostles wrote New Testament texts.

What roles did the rest serve?
- **Doctrine vs.

Function:** Apostolic doctrine was never intended to replace the apostolic function.
- **The Original Twelve:** Restricting apostleship to the twelve does not fit the New Testament data—others were called apostles, including Junia (a woman) and Paul (not one of the twelve).
- **Functional Continuity:** The logic of Ephesians 4 posits the fivefold as essential, interdependent, and simultaneously present.

Cessationism, therefore, rests on later church assumptions and not New Testament teaching.

The dynamic, living functions of apostles, prophets, and evangelists remain vital for the ongoing mission and maturity of the church.

## The Uniqueness and Role of Apostolic Witnesses

> "Ask yourself, how many other people also witnessed the resurrected Jesus?

The answer?

Five hundred! (1 Corinthians 15:3–8), plus Paul, plus the women in Jesus’ band, etc.

So even that is hardly unique."

Recognizing that there are some unique and irreplaceable aspects to the witness of the original Apostles, it is still clear that certain functions—such as church planting, translocal networking, pioneering, and regional leadership—were bequeathed by the original Apostles as the inheritance of the church.

The crucial issue becomes discerning the degree to which all subsequent apostolic functions reflect (without superseding) the unique, foundational role of the original twelve within church history.

In *The Permanent Revolution*, this process is referred to as extracting the “little a” from the “Big A.” In parallel, we must also extract the “little apest” from “Big APEST,” recognizing that all five functions are rooted primarily in Jesus Himself.

## The Logic of Cessationism: A Critique

Cessationists struggle to explain—biblically or historically—why God’s gifts and callings, so evident in the New Testament church, are seemingly absent today.

They also cannot adequately account for the continual emergence of outstanding apostolic and prophetic figures across the ages: Patrick, Francis, Thérèse of Lisieux, John Wesley, Catherine Booth, Martin Luther King Jr., among others.

By arbitrarily excluding apostolic (and, to lesser extents, prophetic and evangelistic) functions, early church fathers effectively removed the very abilities necessary for the church to attain full maturity—clearly a case of self-sabotage.

This reductionism was then passed down to the Western church as tradition.

It is reasonable to suspect that the underlying motivation for this limitation was less about theology and more about consolidating power within an increasingly bureaucratic hierarchy, moving the church under the administrative control of episcopal bishops.

Such logic is profoundly anachronistic and willfully distorting the New Testament witness.

From exegetical, theological, historical, and organizational perspectives, these arguments do not hold up.

Thankfully, recent decades have seen a growing recognition among scholars and leaders that cessationism is, at best, an anachronistic interpretation of Scripture, and at worst, a manipulation of the clear New Testament teaching.

There is nothing in Scripture suggesting that three of the five APEST ministries would cease, leaving just two expressions remaining.

The church is to conform to the original design given by the resurrected, ascended Lord.

If, for instance, Paul—or any of the other apostles—were asked whether a Christianity without apostles or broader APEST was conceivable, he would undoubtedly respond:

> “What?

Never!

What am I?

Chopped liver?

The history of the church (Acts) is APEST writ large ... isn’t it?

Besides, I made it absolutely clear in my letter to the Ephesians that these are *given* (aorist-indicative) as the victory-gifts of the ascending Lord to his Body as an integral unit of Christ’s ministry. A Christianity without apostles would be an un-missional Christianity and therefore untrue to itself.

Why would I contradict my clear teaching and the church’s standard practice throughout?”

## Tradition versus Scripture

One cannot simply appeal to church tradition, such as the shift by Clement of Alexandria from the fivefold ministry to a hierarchical episcopate, as evidence for the obsolescence of the fivefold.

While Clement may have acted as he thought necessary to secure the church in his time, that does not grant his decisions lasting authority—especially given their profoundly unbiblical and disastrous long-term impact.

Church tradition is not infallible or ultimately authoritative; church fathers were subject to the same vulnerabilities, prejudices, and fears as any generation.

Were we to follow every tradition handed down, the result would be an unmanageable and distorted church.

The good news for followers of Jesus is that we are not constrained to uphold every bad decision from church history.

We can—and must—repent, for Clement does not annul Paul: Scripture always trumps tradition.

## A Call Back to the Original Design

To address the complexities of our own context, we must return to fundamental patterns of ministry and leadership found in Scripture.

The failure of the church to live up to its transformative calling often traces back to choices made and codified over time.

In the spirit of *semper reformanda*, the church must continually reorient itself to the gospel and its Founder-Leader.
