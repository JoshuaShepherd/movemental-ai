## Appendix 2: A Game of Thrones?

Charismatic or Missional Approaches?

A separate but related issue to cessationism is the tendency to interpret the fivefold ministry through a hierarchical leadership paradigm, especially in the context of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and within Pentecostal-Charismatic (P-C) traditions.

Many in these circles frame the fivefold primarily in terms of authority (*exousia*) and power (*dynamis*)—both for individual believers and the corporate church.

While the pursuit of Holy Spirit empowerment is valid, applying this paradigm to the Ephesians 4:11 vocations constitutes a categorical error.

Within the P-C stream, conferring the titles of apostle or prophet is often associated with an aura of spiritual power and priestly authority.

This can give rise to a cult of religious celebrity, fostering environments where leaders become untouchable and may dominate or exploit followers.

This is not unique to charismatics; similar dynamics appear elsewhere in evangelical circles.

The gifts of the Spirit listed in 1 Corinthians 12–14 are for the empowerment of all Christians, but Ephesians 4:11 describes gifts from Jesus to the entire Body. APEST is the heritage of the church as a whole, not just for leaders, and is prescriptive for all.

### Ministry for All, Not Leadership for a Few

Where dysfunction emerges is in churches that identify leaders as “God’s anointed”—untouchable individuals operating within hierarchical office structures, manifesting authoritarian power.

This misappropriation of APEST typologies as a warrant for hierarchical authority subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus’ leadership (see Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11).

Instead, APEST must be continually shaped by the humility and self-emptying of Christ.

Any co-option of these gifts to worldly concepts of power undermines the polycentric, radically non-hierarchical dynamic of the New Testament church.

Ephesians 4 makes clear that ministry is given to the *entire* Body (v. 7), not just to a subset of leaders.

Notably, leadership is not even explicitly mentioned in the text; approaching Ephesians 4 as a leadership passage risks institutional dysfunction and division.

### Activating the Fivefold without Division

The way forward is to recognize APEST as the means by which the ministry of Christ is expressed through the whole Body, leading to its fullness and missional vitality.

Paul addresses the entire ecclesia—men and women, slaves and free, every race—emphasizing that each member is apportioned a gift from Christ for the common good (Ephesians 4:7).

Leadership should emerge from *within* these distributed gifts, not be imposed above them.

Approaching the fivefold with this Christological understanding frees us from the destructive power dynamics that have plagued much of church history.
