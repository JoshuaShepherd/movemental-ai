## Appendix 3: The Exiling of the APEs 

*By Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim, 2012*

> "The basic trouble [with the modern church] is that the proposed cure has such a striking similarity to the disease." 
> —Elton Trueblood

> "In a revolutionary era ... you need to learn to think and act like a revolutionary.

People in revolutions who don’t act that way have a particular name: victims."
> —Joshua Ramo Cooper

The recurring theme of the “exiled hero” in literature and film points to an embedded wisdom: sometimes the solutions needed by the community come from the margins and from those who have been rejected.

Likewise, the ministries of Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist (APEs) have been cast out of mainstream church life.

The prevailing Shepherd-Teacher (ST) model of leadership, though essential for stability, has, in isolation, led to equilibrium and stasis—a condition akin to organizational death.

### The Dangers of Equilibrium

When the ST roles dominate at the expense of APEST as a whole, the church loses its capacity for adaptive change, missional engagement, and creative renewal.

Jeffrey Goldstein describes organizational equilibrium as the state of least complexity—a place where any change is resisted and innovation is stifled.

Over time, the resources necessary for renewal (often embodied by APEs) are ejected, leaving the organization incapable of change even when it is most needed.

However, these issues are not necessarily the result of bad intentions; rather, the ST gifts serve to build community and sustain faith.

But as integrators and operators, Shepherds and Teachers are not equipped to drive missional movement alone.

Generative, adaptive ministry comes through the interplay with APEs.

### Restoring the Necessary Dialectic

Living systems resist change and tend toward equilibrium, but continual adaptation is vital.

Thus, leadership must be willing to endure necessary conflict and disruption in order to move God’s people forward.

The vested interests, pride, and failure to recognize systemic issues can hinder change—but the Spirit’s calling toward mission must be awakened.

All humans are vulnerable to the misuse of power.

Both APE and ST roles carry risks, but it has largely been the monopolizing of leadership by priestly (ST) types that has led to profound abuses and a loss of generative capacity within the church.

This has robbed the church of its adventurous, missional character, leaving it defensive and risk-averse.

Christ’s Kingdom calls leaders to guide the church into the future, embracing risk and overcoming the impulse for safety.

The Great Commission is not a guarantee of “safe” ministry, but rather a call to faithfulness amid challenge.

### Re-embracing the Exiled Ministries

Renewal requires a return to the foundational sources and a willingness to integrate all five APEST ministries—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—for the sake of the church's mission and maturity.
