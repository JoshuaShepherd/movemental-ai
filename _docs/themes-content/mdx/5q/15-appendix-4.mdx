## Appendix 4: Threefold or Fivefold Patterns in Ministry

Historically, Christian theology has often categorized Jesus’ ministry using the Munus Triplex, or the Threefold Office: Prophet, Priest, and King.

While these categories have helped many comprehend different aspects of Christ’s work, they offer only a partial framework for understanding ministry as it is expressed through Jesus and, by extension, the church.

The tri-perspectival model (Prophet, Priest, King), though an improvement over the simple duality of pastor and teacher, lacks robust biblical grounding—particularly when applied to the roles of believers (for example, the “king” office is difficult to justify for average Christians).

The most scripturally consistent and practically nuanced model broadens this lens to the Fivefold—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher (APEST).

Paul locates APEST ministry in Jesus Christ as the origin and source.

The fullness of Christ is expressed in and through these diverse forms and practices, as shown in Ephesians 4:

> "To each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it … So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ...

We will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.

From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."
> —Ephesians 4:7–16 (paraphrased and emphasized)

**Key Points:**

- The ministry of Christ is embedded in and fulfilled through the ministry of all His followers.
- Diminishing engagement with any dimension of the fivefold reduces our communal and individual ability to embody Jesus.

Living systems theory, as well as scriptural evidence, urge the church to keep all five dimensions of Jesus’ ministry dynamically engaged in its life and mission.

Any reduction narrows the church's ability to respond faithfully to its call.

## Conclusion: Continuous Reformation

In a time of institutional decline and cultural change, the church’s primary calling is to realign continually with Scripture and the missional designs set in place by the resurrected Lord.

Returning to the fivefold ministry gifts—understood christologically, exercised communally, and freed from the distortions of hierarchy or tradition—is imperative for the life and mission of the church.

We are called, in the spirit of *semper reformanda*, to repentance, renewal, and faithfulness.

## The Extra-Ecclesial Dimensions and the Orders of Creation

The language used to describe the extra-ecclesial dimensions of life—those aspects outside the visible Church that constitute society's structures—is important.

These dimensions, too, are part of the "orders of creation," disciplined, sanctified, and redeemed by the kingdom work of Jesus.

> "I need to reiterate that while I believe the kingdom of God calls us to relate to, and work redemptively in and among all the various domains of society, I do not personally adhere to the theocratic domination theology of the so-called New Apostolic Reformation or the associated Seven Mountains movement."

While such groups use the language of APEST, they generally advocate for a hierarchical model of leadership, which stands in direct contradiction to the servant leadership modeled by Jesus (see Matthew 20:25–27; Philippians 2:1–11).

Do not let terminological similarities—ironically shared with Reformed theology—obscure the real importance of this topic for the broader missional conversation.

## Leadership, Calling, and Ministry: The APEST Typology

Paul’s teaching in Ephesians 4:7 ("to each one of us") implies the ministry of all believers and affirms leadership as an integral dimension within that ministry ([Lee, 2013](#references)).

The APEST model—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—provides a fivefold lens through which to view the church's participation in Christ's ministry ([Hirsch & Frost, 2013](#references)).

## On Hierarchy Versus Servanthood

Despite their use of APEST language, movements like the New Apostolic Reformation generally adopt a hierarchy that counters Jesus's model of servant leadership.

Servant leadership is foundational to the New Testament understanding of ecclesial ministry structures.

## Creation, Redemption, and the Divine Image

The imago Dei, though marred through the Fall, persists and is restored through Christ.

Creation is not merely about origins; rather, it is about recognizing the entire cosmos, throughout time, as dependent on God ([Pannenberg, 2004](#references)).

As C.S. Lewis and Wolfhart Pannenberg argued, God is both above, beyond, and behind nature, yet not to be identified with natural processes ([Lewis, 1996](#references)).

---

## Storytelling, Evangelism, and the Hero's Journey

Storytelling embodies the evangelistic archetype and highlights the narrative structure at the heart of Jesus's story of redemption.

Walter Brueggemann demonstrates that gospel proclamation is multilayered storytelling ([Brueggemann, 1993](#references)).

Jesus's life mirrors the stages of the hero's journey as articulated by Joseph Campbell and summarized by Christopher Vogler:

1. The Ordinary World 
2. The Call to Adventure 
3. Refusal of the Call 
4. Meeting with the Mentor 
5. Crossing the Threshold to the “Special World” 
6. Tests, Allies, and Enemies 
7. Approach to the Innermost Cave 
8. The Ordeal 
9. Reward 
10. The Road Back 
11. The Resurrection 
12. Return with the Elixir

> "As myth transcends thought, Incarnation transcends myth.
>
> The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact."
>
> —C.S. Lewis, *God in the Dock*

This "myth became fact" in the Incarnation: the narrative of redemption entered history in the person of Christ ([Lewis, 2012](#references); [Markos, 2012](#references)).

## The Logic of Recapitulation: Christ as the New Adam

Irenaeus taught that Jesus recapitulates, or "sums up," all stages of human existence, sanctifying each by obedience ([Hinson, 2005](#references); [Allison, 2007](#references)).

The apostle Paul makes a similar argument concerning Christ’s resurrection, contrasting Adam and Christ (see 1 Corinthians 15:21–28), illustrating this principle of recapitulation.

---

## Jesus and the Fivefold Ministry

Chapters five and six present Jesus as the ultimate embodiment of the APEST archetypes.

The five functions—apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher—find their perfect fulfillment in him.

These are not arbitrary; rather, they are deeply woven into the biblical witness (see Old Testament types and their fulfillment in Christ).

### The Apostolic Sending

The term “apostle” is rooted in the Greek verb apostello, "to send." Its meaning denotes an agent or ambassador with the authority of the sender ([Brisco](http://missionalchurchnetwork.com/missionalsending-language/)).

In the New Testament, apostles are sent by Jesus, just as Jesus was sent by God (see John’s Gospel, and especially the language of “sentness” used over 60 times in reference to Jesus).

## Ministry Functions in the Early Church

Paul's gospel in Colossians 1:25–29 exemplifies the multidimensional nature of church ministry:

- **Apostolic**: Commissioned to make known God's word among the Gentiles
- **Evangelistic**: Proclaiming Christ
- **Prophetic**: Disclosing God’s mystery, admonishing
- **Didactic**: Teaching with wisdom
- **Pastoral**: Presenting everyone mature in Christ

As Eugene Peterson notes, biblical metaphors for the Church are more than symbols; they ground us in reality and connect us to the unseen work of the Trinity.

> "If the movement fails to resemble, act, and sound like the Founder, then something must be deeply wrong." 
> —*The Forgotten Ways*, ch. 4

## The Marks and Ministry of the Church

Missional theologian Darrell Guder emphasizes that the Nicene marks of the church should be interpreted in reverse order—apostolic, catholic, holy, and one—so that apostolicity defines every aspect of church life ([Guder, 2016](#references)).

Charles Van Engen affirms that "the Church is, by its nature and calling, in the first and last instance an apostolic body," sent into the world to witness to God's redemptive order ([Kraemer, 1956](#references)).

> As Neil Cole states, "If you can define church without Jesus then you can do church without Jesus."

---

## APEST in Contemporary Practice

Churches and denominations worldwide are gradually rediscovering the APEST framework.

However, function often becomes replaced by form, and ministry roles are depersonalized.

Knowing one's vocation and calling, as discerned through APEST, is vital for spiritual fulfillment and effectiveness ([APEST Test](http://www.apest.org)).

> “We are told in Ephesians 4:1 that we are to ‘live a life worthy of the callings we have received.’ It’s our life’s purpose to integrate the calling of God into our individual lives—to live worthily.”

---

## Practical Implementation and Theological Challenges

- **Cessationism** tends to abstract apostolic and prophetic functions into doctrine rather than lived function, typically for sociopolitical reasons, not Scripture.
- The ministry of the Body of Christ is "radically democratic" and polycentric; power and function are distributed among all believers.
- Movements and organizations risk decline when they lose touch with their founding charism, as Max Weber observed.
- APEST ministry is not about hierarchical "offices," but a comprehensive, democratizing structure rooted in the ministry of Jesus.

## Conclusion: Participation in Christ's Ministry

The ecclesia (church) exists to extend the experience, logic, and impact of Jesus’s ministry in the world.

All acts of ministry are a participation in the ministry of Christ through his Body.

> "The church is the primary agency of the kingdom of God, the principal arena through which God is blessing and redeeming the world.

It is through the deliberate choices, actions, and activities of all his people that Jesus chooses to extend his kingdom."
> —Adapted from *The Permanent Revolution*

Getting the APEST model right is crucial, as mistakes have far-reaching consequences for mission and witness.
