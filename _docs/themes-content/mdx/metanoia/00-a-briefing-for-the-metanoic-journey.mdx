# Metanoia

In Metanoia, Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly recognize the church has reached a turning point.

Social unrest, political discord, a life-altering pandemic—all of these are forcing leaders to consider how they move forward in a changed world. Hirsch and Kelly offer insightful answers to important missiological questions: What if, instead of following old models, we turned to God for new ideas? What if, instead of holding onto the past, we sought God’s future? Metanoia brilliantly explains how repentance realigns our hearts with God’s and creates a shift that prepares his people to reach the world in brand-new ways.

DAVE FERGUSON, lead visionary, New Thing; author, BLESS The church needs a course correction! Far beyond the guilt and shame frameworks of repentance we have previously held to, this book beckons us to consider metanoia as the radical paradigm shift we need in order to see with fresh eyes the beauty awaiting us in Christ. Compelling, hopeful, and unflinching, Metanoia is a masterful book that every Christian leader should read.

LISA RODRIQUEZ-WATSON, national director, Missio Alliance; contributing author, Voices of Lament and Red Skies Every once in a while, I find myself reading a book that I have to close. It’s too much, too good. My imagination is captivated, the vision of God is beyond belief, and I need to breathe.

It’s so overwhelmingly true and hopeful, that it shifts the foundation of my soul. With the WHY linked with the HOW, Alan and Rob plumb the depths of Jesus and emerge with a way forward for all of us, individually and collectively—a force, perhaps like the one that caused the disciples to drop everything and follow.

NANCY ORTBERG, CEO, Transforming the Bay with Christ; author, Unleashing the Power of Rubber Bands In a world awash with peripherals, the message of Metanoia is truly and refreshingly radical—striking right at the very radix, the root, of the ways in which we are to think, live, and lead as followers of Jesus Christ. I particularly welcome the blend of provocative thought and pragmatic empowerment, typical as it is of Alan Hirsch’s life as both a prophetic intellect and catalytic leader.

PETE GREIG, 24-7 Prayer International and Emmaus Rd, UK There are very few writers who can take a concept that you have known for a long time and help you rediscover it in a way that helps you see everything anew. Alan Hirsch seems to do this with every book. In Metanoia, he and his coauthor, Rob Kelly, reframe a biblical idea that for many has become burdensome and guilt-inducing into a pathway for new energy, creativity, and deep transformation. You’ll want to return to this book over and over again, as Hirsch and Kelly demonstrate their ability to be docents of genuine transformation.

TOD BOLSINGER, Fuller Seminary; author, Canoeing the Mountains and Tempered Resilience We are living in days of unprecedented change and cannot afford to ignore the practice and discipline of metanoia. Alan and Rob help us understand how we have got to where we are and show us how to get to where God wants to take us. Metanoia is not for the faint of heart but for those who wholeheartedly want to join God in his mission here on earth. This book should be read by every leader, and the concepts integrated into every church, ministry, and organization.

CHRISTINE CAINE, founder, A21 and Propel Women Coming to terms with, and applying, the grace implicit in discovering and admitting error (our own not others) may be the most important competency of our time. This book is a master class, a philosophical tour de force—a profound, transformative, and luminous work.

BRIAN SANDERS, founder, Underground Network; author, Microchurches Metanoia courageously peels back the wilting ecclesiastical onion and exposes the heart of our problem within the Western church. Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly challenge us to a fundamental intellectual reorientation of our very selves as a true and fitting worship response before we ever dare to chart a new course. Unlearning before relearning. And mind-blowing metanoia in between. Through personal experience and biblical reflection, Hirsch and Kelly offer us dynamite in a few dangerous pages. Read slowly and carefully.

And at your own risk. For what your heart has been craving might be revealed.

JEFF CHRISTOPHERSON, leader and movement catalyst; author, Once You See This book comes at a time when it is deeply needed, as the church continues to recover from a global pandemic, as well as navigating racial unrest, political polarization, and the need for a new awakening within evangelicalism. Within these pages you will gain insights that hopefully lead you as church leaders to rediscover biblical rootedness, reimagine the mission of the church, and re-engage cultures for a greater advancement of the kingdom of God.

DR. EFREM SMITH, co-pastor, Midtown Church; author, The Post-Black and Post-White Church and Killing Us Softly This book is like Lady Wisdom crying out in the streets, inviting people to open their minds and soften their hearts to receive the precious, life-altering, beautiful, good news of Jesus. Read it and weep. Your tears will turn to joy as the One who holds our lives and future comes into clearer view.

DANIELLE STRICKLAND, advocate, author, and speaker The body of Christ is the hope of the world, but is there hope for the church? Hirsch and Kelly have gifted us with eyes to see that we are living in a kairos moment in time, and that if we choose continual metanoia, God can shift the tracks of history through us.

JR WOODWARD, national director, The V3 Movement; author, The Scandal of Leadership and Creating a Missional Culture With scholarly care and penetrating insight, Metanoia offers us a broad sweeping reset for how change happens in our lives and our organizations. Not for the faint of heart, nor for those who only want to think and not do, Hirsch and Kelly’s book forces us to reconsider the depths of Christian metanoia for how we live and how we lead. For every church, pastor, and Christian leader longing for Christ’s inbreaking future.

DAVID FITCH, BR Lindner Chair of Theology, Northern Seminary, Chicago; author, Faithful Presence There are few writers I know who write with such prophetic insight as Alan Hirsch. We are still reaping fruits from The Forgotten Ways many years later. Metanoia is as catalytic, perhaps more so than anything Alan has written to date. I believe that Metanoia will rank among the books that changed things in the twenty-first century.

PEYTON JONES, author, Church Plantology; director, The mX Platform; founder, New Breed Training Metanoia is exactly what the church needs today. Hirsch and Kelly not only present an accurate diagnosis of what ails the church, but they also provide a compelling remedy for the cure. I instantly desired to make personal application to my own life and ministry. I absolutely love this book!

BRAD BRISCO, director, Bivocational Church Planting for the North American Mission Board; author, Missional Essentials, Next Door as It Is in Heaven, and Covocational Church Planting Of all the people that I’ve known and worked with in ministry for these past forty years, Alan Hirsch has had as much profound impact on the Western church as anyone I’ve personally known. Together with my friend, Rob Kelly, in Metanoia, he’s once again delivered “North Star” guidance by which to set a course. The strategically thoughtful, experientially informed, personally challenging, and collectively transformative content has been written for today with tomorrow in view. It is visionary in scope yet practical in nature for leaders no longer content with the status quo of docile acquiescence. If Alan’s writing, I’m reading … and you should, too!

DR. MARK DEYMAZ, directional leader, Mosaic Church (Little Rock); CEO, Mosaix Global Network; author, The Coming Revolution in Church Economics Hirsch and Kelly present a profound and urgent message to the church today. The call to metanoia can no longer be a mere prologue. It must be the leitmotif of the life and mission of the Christian and the church. Read at your own risk, and prepare to have your mind blown.

FR. JAMES MALLON, pastor; author; founder, Divine Renovation Ministry For two decades, Alan Hirsch has been a leading voice at the intersection of gospel, church, and culture. In Metanoia, along with Rob Kelly, Alan is once again prompting the church to find her best self through rethinking everything, reviewing all her plans and programs in light of Jesus and his gospel of the kingdom. This is a courageous book for passionate leaders.

TODD HUNTER, founder, The Center for Formation, Justice and Peace; former national director, Association of Vineyard Churches; author, Christianity Beyond Belief Today’s church in the Western world holds a dangerously anaemic vision for repentance. More than ever, the church must lean into the deeply robust vision for repentance (metanoia) with the hope of dismantling toxic systems and turning toward a more vibrant and bright future. Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly have been sounding this alarm for more than a decade, and now they prophetically and pastorally call the church to repent, relearn, and re-embrace the mind of Christ. If more church leaders read this book and submit to the way of metanoia in the power of the Spirit, a radiant future could be ahead of us.

TARA BETH LEACH, pastor; author, Radiant Church This is a mind-blowing book, literally. In Metanoia, my friends Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly lay out both the promise and the pathways for the kind of personal and collective conversions we desperately need if we want to see God’s shalom reigning in and through us.

Redeeming the often misused and misunderstood word “repent,” they show the beauty of the kind of transformation Jesus promised. An inside-out transformation that holds the promise of renewal. Our culture is struggling. It’s ripe for renewal. Will we be ready?

KEVIN PALAU, president, Luis Palau Association; author, Unlikely This book is so awesome that I don’t know if I can find words to do it justice! In it, Alan and Rob give a much needed powerfully prophetic word to the Western church. This book should come with a warning label because you will not be the same after you read it. Your discipleship and engagement with the local church will be forever changed, and it will impact everything you do.

DANA ALLIN, synod executive, Evangelical Order of Presbyterians; author, Simple Discipleship Decades of the “missional” conversation have not led to church-as-movement. Why?

Perhaps because we cannot go from unlearning our inherited paradigm to learning anew without wholeheartedly embracing Jesus’ call to metanoia. This book describes that indispensable, painful, and beautiful process of biblical transformation so that we can see and be the church Jesus promised to build: multiplying networks of disciples in communal relationships who exist in and beyond the gathered expression. Take the red pill, and brace yourself for a paradigm-shifting journey.

WES WATKINS, facilitator, Motus Dei Network; missiologist, One Collective We long for change. Metanoia reminds us that the deep transformation we want for ourselves and our mission will not be possible until we are willing to be changed. It invites a rigorous assessment of where we are and casts a vision of where we could be. To go forward may look like turning around.

MANDY SMITH, pastor; author, Unfettered and The Vulnerable Pastor This book is a refreshingly honest look at our need to embrace repentance. Alan and Rob dive deeply into the idea of metanoia and portray it as a gift of God for us and our churches if only we would heed and respond to its call. They weave theology, social change theory, and practical tools together in a way that not only convinced me afresh of my need for repentance but also filled me with hope for deep and lasting change in the Australian church. It’s a must-read for Christian leaders!

BREE MILLS, director, Micro Churches Australia; Australia director, The Company Asignificant shift needs to happen for the church to embrace a broader understanding of her kingdom calling—one that is truly Christlike, gospel-fluent, movement-minded, and city-renewing. This is especially true of my tribe, the Latino church. But we cannot just jump to change. We need to first be awakened to change to avoid the typical “plug and play” pragmatic approach that, in the case of the Latino church, has perpetuated colonized expressions of ministry. Being trained and coached by Alan and his team in the journey of metanoia helped me and the leaders I serve understand that before we step into the new, we need to deeply reflect on the old and enter the journey of painful deconstruction.

Then, and only then, can we be awakened (metanoia) enough to journey into the new with different paradigms, platforms, and practices. This book is a must for servant leaders who are serious about ushering movemental changes in their churches, organizations, and cities.

ROBERT GUERRERO, vice president catalyst, Redeemer City to City; founder, Avance The church is living in the midst of a tectonic shift in American religion. Needed more than ever is a theology for navigating this cultural paradigm shift. This book provides a theology for embracing change through a biblical analysis of metanoia. This is an essential read for aspiring church-based changemakers. It is both inspirational and practical, while maintaining missional faithfulness. This is a book about hope, not despair.

DR. DAVID JOHN SEEL, JR., author, The New Copernicans and Network Power Every Christian leader who longs for personal, church, or organizational transformation needs to read this book! Alan and Rob aren’t just talking about distant theories; they are speaking of what they know and have experienced for themselves. Get ready for true and radical change when you apply the wisdom from these trusted guides.

REV. DR. NICOLE MARTIN, chief impact officer, Christianity Today; author, Made to Lead and Leaning In, Letting Go For those wanting to close and address the gap between the church and its missional engagement with the culture, this book outlines the hard and humbling journey we must undertake together.

MARK REYNOLDS, senior strategic advisor, Redeemer City to City Metanoia is a prophetic masterpiece of the highest order. Hirsch—now with Rob Kelly—has led the way in helping us see the need to shift our ecclesial paradigm from Christendom to a postmodern apostolic framework. Together they have shown us how to do it. Overcoming the knowledge-practice gap is always the challenge. Metanoia unpacks the biblical process—step-by-step—for unlearning and relearning what we need to activate the church’s apostolic DNA. Amust-read for any disciple-leader that wants total transformation in the church now.

DR. MICHEL THERRIEN, founder and president, Preambula Group, Pittsburgh, PA; former academic dean, St. Vincent Seminary; author, The Catholic Faith Explained New strategies don’t fully work unless we let go of the old ways that no longer serve the needs of the hour. Taking a new route involves leaving the old route behind. Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly show how this conversion to the new involves reversal, reorientation, and mindset shift. There is simply no change without it. This book reveals how metanoia is the root of ongoing fruitfulness. Agreat addition to the literature!

MICHAEL FROST, Morling College, Sydney Jesus’ most important words occur within the Lord’s Prayer: “on earth as it is in heaven.” The gospel movement from heaven toward earth is captured in doctrines of incarnation, revelation, and kairos. The gospel response from human beings is captured in the idea of metanoia. Discipleship is a journey of aligning ourselves with an ever-agile Jesus who leads us on a journey toward healing and repairing the broken creation. Hirsch and Kelly have done a great service in describing how this happens, not only within individual lives but also for organizations becoming discipled to align with the movement of Jesus.

JOHN CHANDLER, founder, Uptick; author, Uptick: A Blueprint for Finding and Forming the Next Generation of Pioneering Kingdom Leaders Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly have written the right book at the right time. At this moment of global upheaval and escalating cultural change, the church has struggled to meet the enormous challenge it presents. As the title of their book indicates, what is needed now is metanoia, a deep, thoroughgoing change, both individual and corporate. The strength of this book is in its clear definition of the nature of metanoia, its determination to lay hold of radical Christocentric change, and an insightful, accessible model that sheds light on a pathway to that change.

PETER HERBECK, executive vice president and director, Missions for Renewal Ministries The word “reset” has become a byword. God’s word for reset is “metanoia.” It has personal, communal, and cosmic dimensions that “reset” can never reach. Hirsch and Kelly’s exploration of metanoia in the Christian’s spiritual life and its outworking in ministry is compelling and provocative. Their journey through the theoretical and practical elements will capture the reader’s attention. If ever there was a key to the Christian life, metanoia is it. Getting your life and your ministry in sync with the flow of the Spirit will generate new fruitfulness. It will be risky and challenging, but it is God’s default setting for renewal.

STUART DEVENISH, independent scholar, writer, practitioner, teacher, and researcher in Christian formation, spirituality, and ministry When the world is changing so fast, what about us? Are we reacting to these volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous times by digging in our heels or changing our hearts?

Alan and Rob have reversed my thinking on metanoia in this timely read. Warning: the word “change” is found on 109 pages! Take it in, and let it do its work. The world is desperate for Jesus’ church to look more like its Founder.

DR. TAMMY DUNAHOO, executive dean, Portland Seminary; author, Cultivating a DiscipleCentric Growth Culture The Christian life has been described as a series of commitments, big and small, that we make in response to every new commitment God offers to us in Christ. If that is the transforming journey for us individually, it is also the paradigm shift for the community of Jesus, which Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly so vividly call for in this book.

LEIGHTON FORD, founder, Leighton Ford Ministries; author, Transforming Leadership In this book Hirsch and Kelly restore repentance (metanoia) to its true priority and significance, rescuing it from a once-for-all personal piety and restoring it to its foundational role in both personal discipleship and the ongoing transformation of churches and organizations. Metanoia is disclosed as a joy, not just a turning from, but a turning to a fuller engagement with Jesus and his kingdom. The processes described in part two make profound institutional change imaginable.

GRAHAM CRAY, honorary assistant bishop, Diocese of York; former archbishops’ missioner; leader, UK Fresh Expressions Team; author God’s Invitation has always been toward metanoia. Aseed must fall to the ground. New wineskins are needed to rightly hold the new wine. And we too need to be converted and become like children, over and over again in order to change and grow. In Metanoia, Alan and Rob invite the church to join God’s process for growth, change, and renewing impact.

DR. ERIC SWANSON, senior fellow, Leadership Network; coauthor, To Transform a City It has been vogue for decades to speak about brokenness in the Christian life. What Hirsch and Kelly do in Metanoia is move us beyond a trite expression of a superficial spirituality to the deep and rich language of repentance. Their call to both personal and organizational metanoia is a first step to seeing a genuine movement of God in the West. Such repentance presents new possibilities, even ways of thinking, for us and the ministries we lead. The unlearning that needs to take place to get us in a posture that genuinely acknowledges Christ as the head of the church presents a learning curve that isn’t insurmountable but will certainly require humility and contrition as well as the mind of Christ. These are not easy waters to navigate. Alan and Rob expertly steer us through what must be considered nothing less than the spiritual discipline of metanoia—a superpower for Hirsch and Kelly.

MICHAEL T. COOPER, professor, Missiological Theology; author, When Evangelicals Sneeze and award-winning Ephesiology At Moore Theological College, one of my lecturers used to say, “All of life is repentance (metanoia).” It puzzled me at the time. Wasn’t “repentance” the word for a one-off transformation: becoming a Christian? After decades of living, loving, and leading, I have slowly realized, in my own kind of “repentance,” just how right my professor was. In Metanoia, Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly have unpacked this important insight for both the individual and the community, both the Christian church and (dare I say) any organization that wants to be nimble, flexible, and just! Scriptural, psychological, and sociological—here is an exciting guide to becoming a perpetual learner, always guided by the higher things, never settling for the idiosyncrasies of our often-misguided selves.

DR. JOHN DICKSON, author; Jean Kvamme Distinguished Professor, Wheaton College, I llinois Disruptive times call for a new kind of leadership. Metanoia is a guidebook for those ready to unlearn existing paradigms, small-minded thinking, and obsolete practices.

It directs us back to the Invitation of Jesus and Paul, to discover a wholehearted spirituality that emerges from repentance and openness and embraces new rhythms and habits. Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly will guide you and your tribe to “Eureka!” experiences of deep transformative change that are essential for us as individual leaders and the churches and training systems we serve.

DARREN CRONSHAW, Baptist pastor; mission catalyst; research director and professor of Missional Leadership, Australian College of Ministries, Sydney College of Divinity; author, Credible Witness and Dangerous Prayer; coauthor, Sentness In this liminal time in which we live, Metanoia is a gift to the church. My friends Alan Hirsch and Rob Kelly have given us a unique combination of a deeply theological, yet practical guide for any leader or organization seeking to reorient themselves to the mind and mission of Jesus.

DAVE RUNYON, coauthor, The Art of Neighboring “Do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is,” wrote Paul in Romans 12:2. But how do we, the people of God, experience this kind of deep transformation together, and where will it take us? Hirsch and Kelly call it “metanoia,” and in this book, they help us explore who the church can be if she attunes herself to this deep work of God in human life. So inspiring and helpful. Awonderful read.

LINDA BERGQUIST, church planting catalyst; adjunct seminary professor; coauthor Alan and Rob have written a masterful missiology rooted in repentance, naming our collective need to unlearn, turn, and be transformed by Jesus in every dimension, so that we might build the movements that God imagines. This hopeful book is a wise guide to reimagining the future for the church.

TYLER PRIEB, founder, Missional Labs, New York City Once again, Alan Hirsch (with Rob Kelly) has disturbed my status quo and forced me to acknowledge my false assumptions and blindness to different ways of seeing the world.

Metanoia frames repentance in a much bigger, richer, more grace-filled perspective that sets us free from the epidemic levels of anxiety, discouragement, and frustration that many of us feel. Christendom is changing and, more than ever, we need a paradigm shift, a metanoia, to allow Christ to renew our minds and see the mission he has given us with new eyes. I welcome this disturbance!

RIC THORPE, bishop of I slington; acting bishop of Kensington; director, The Gregory Centre for Church Multiplication I am convinced the global church has an opportunity to change and return to its movemental design. I call it “our John 15 moment.” The old must be pruned so the new can grow. But to endure this John 15 moment will require us to repent of the old and see the new again. Change is hard. Yet, I think you will agree the church must change. The hard part is how to change and, more importantly, what must be changed. Change begins with repentance, which is challenging for all of us and is why this book will disrupt your paradigms.

## DENNAE PIERRE

My daughter Rosa, a vivacious fifteen-month-old, loves exploring the world around her. Other kids her age run away from danger, but open doors and busy intersections seem to exert a magnetic pull on her tiny legs. We’ve learned that closed doors keep Rosa safe because they separate her from potential danger. We make especially sure that every door leading out to the street stays shut!

  Closing doors is only part of our plan in raising Rosa. Our grander
  purpose—and our ultimate desire—is that she would be able to enjoy the
  full freedom of exploration and discovery in the huge, wide world that is
  is a world filled with all kinds of awe and wonder to satisfy her wide-eyed
  out there.
  The mental frames of Western Christianity have often focused on

  means of protection while neglecting the grander purpose for which
  sin-avoidance as closed doors—ways of staying away from the dangers of
  an Invitation to explore God’s expansive kingdom.
  And that’s not the worst of it. Even more tragic is that our spiritual

formation and communal practices are often anemic, making it difficult to maintain attunement to the Spirit's adaptive and progressive work in our lives, and we have continued to keep the doors shut, to keep Rosa safe into her teenage years, and we will need to maintain some form of healthy fear as she is handed car keys and backs out of our driveway.

But we will need to gradually change our parenting methods between now and then to ensure she is ready to drive a vehicle and explore our city. Similarly, the one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter solutions, and "magic pills" the church offers for discipleship, church planting, and theological formation expose an immaturity in our understanding of the journey we each must take to see true transformation. The consequences are evident in our own lives with God, each other, and our neighbors.

We need metanoia.

Metanoia is a practice of making visible what is currently invisible. It invites us to see differently and to experience personal and corporate transformation. It requires us to have the courage to sit in the discomfort that we may be transformed, healed, and renewed. Metanoia will form us not only to see objective fact, but also to see through the eyes and heart of God himself. The practice of metanoia deepens our yearning for God in ways that increase our longing to experience his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

It attunes us to God's wondrous reality. It increases our capacity to look at brokenness in the world through the mind of Christ, melting away the very shame and pride that keeps us from looking in the first place. I believe this is what God is doing in the church today. The Spirit is awakening us to new ways of seeing and being in order to have greater communion with himself and each other. He is asking us to look again at that plot of dirt and see the treasure he has hidden just below the surface. He is inviting us to leave everything behind to purchase that field!

Metanoia is a practice the church desperately needs today; and because we, as leaders, have so often failed to engage with it, we have gained a public reputation for misusing power, maintaining oppressive systems, and creating services and discipleship models that do little to challenge consumerism or to equip people to live courageous lives of radical love in this world. If you are a leader who is unsettled with Christian community that feels far from being the body of Christ, if you are unsettled with the men and women far from Christ who struggle to discover him in our churches; if you long to see the kingdom of God break into our everyday lives, then receive the gift of grace that is metanoia.

It is for this reason that I am incredibly grateful for Alan and Rob's work on this book. We are in deep need of this significant theological contribution and its Invitation to inhabit the glorious mind of Christ! I am hoping that their work invites countless men and women into a practice of metanoia that challenges the spirit of the present age and seeks conformity to the King and his kingdom.

Holy Spirit, please grant your people the courage to live in solidarity with Christ's sufferings as we follow in his steps and discover the healing and transformation that comes from you, and grant us the grace to extend this healing to a world deeply in need of him. Grant us the grace required to pursue

A Briefing for the (Metanoic) Journey

"It is one of the sad ironies of aging, that after decades of struggle and learning, one finally discovers an idea that would have made all the difference." Metanoia has been such an idea for me (Alan). If I had understood this life-changing concept earlier, my work with movements, networks, and denominations, as well as in local ministry, would have been far more effective. I write this book in the hope that they might see greater fruitfulness, as well as avoid significant mistakes, whether churches, non-profits, or marketplace enterprises.

## The Pre-History of This Book

This book has a rather unusual history. The idea of metanoia was explored as a key theme in the book I coauthored with Mark Nelson, Reframation: Seeing God, People, and Mission Through Reenchanted Frames.1 As the title suggests, Reframation explores the importance of seeing things in a different frame in order to advance in our knowledge of God and his mission. Metanoia—paradigm shift and conversion that changes the heart—is the gateway for seeing through a different, Jesus-shaped lens and is therefore a topic explored throughout Reframation. The topic is also explored somewhat throughout all my writings—the missional paradigm shift in The Forgotten Ways and On the Verge, and the need to rethink the apostolic (sent, teacher) ministry in 5Q, in particular.2

But the real stimulus for this book you are now reading started when Movement Leaders Collective, the organization I cofounded and colead, ran a series of training events in 2017, situated amid the ideological swirl of the Trump presidency and the beginning of the global crisis, the theme resonated with all present and proved to be deeply needed. Because of the widespread misunderstanding by most Christians on the topic, and because it was so needed in these times, I began to explore more deeply the nature of metanoia and how it can be implemented to bring transformative change

Early on, I approached Dennae Pierre to co-write the book with me. As the highly capable leader of Redeemer City to City (North America) as well as Surge Network in Phoenix, Dennae is not only a remarkable young leader whom I deeply admire but also would have brought a much-needed female perspective to the book. I am convinced that many of the problems we currently face arise from the fact that almost all thought leaders and theologians (in the Protestant world at least) are male and therefore see things through a distinctly one-dimensional, male, outlook. This deficit in the female perspective means we are not getting the whole picture. And, with apologies to Einstein, we must recognize that we cannot solve our (decidedly male) problems with more of the same (male) kind of thinking that created them in the first place.3 This necessitates an integration of the female mind and voice into the equation. By coauthoring, Dennae and I wanted to show we really do need each other to answer the problems we seek to resolve. However, Dennae had a season of growth in her work and family (including an unexpected fifth child joining her family!). She felt led to focus on developing the new leaders on her teams and decided the Spirit was calling her to forego the writing project with me. Thankfully, she did not pull out before she had offered some invaluable commentary and editorial feedback on the material I had written. And so I want to acknowledge her input into the shaping of this book. Watch out for Dr. Dennae Pierre! I believe she is a highly significant, thoroughly refreshing, emerging voice in missional movements.

Believing deeply in the synergistic value of coauthoring, I subsequently approached my dear friend and colleague, Rob Kelly—an absolute gem of a human, is super smart, and has a unique grasp of what metanoia means in practice. And like me, he loves theology, the social sciences, organizational leadership, and generally all things nerdy. We resonate deeply on just about everything. He was therefore a natural fit. Although I am the primary author of this book, Rob made a significant contribution to the material by taking the lead on three chapters in part two (chapters seven to nine) and by adding editorial comment throughout. Since I did secondary editing on his material, it is expressed using the common word "we." But every now and again, we will refer to the "I" when relaying autobiographical content, as I am doing now, and Rob will do later.

## Issues of Style and Substance

If you have read any of my previous books, you will have something of a sense of my style and approach. This book is no different in that it seeks to provide substantive but distilled content applicable to discipleship and spirituality, as well as to leadership in the local church or organization.

True metanoia in the biblical sense is inseparable from the person of Jesus, and so Rob and I make no apology for using theology to guide best practitioners in a way that is consistent with the God we serve. We reject pure pragmatics and the can-do techniques so prevalent throughout leadership literature because they have proven inadequate to address many of the many serious issues we are now facing—including celebrity culture, toxic leadership, and organizational structures that are almost impossible to change.4 Besides, as God's people, we are called to the discipline of thinking thoughts after God and following his ways (Ephesians 5:1).

Certainly, all Christian leaders are expected to operate from a theologically informed mind, arising from the discipline of seeing the world through the prism of God-logic.

Thinking and speaking theologically is also important because theology is the "authorized language" that reaches deep into our collective consciousness to retrieve reserves and resources that lie largely hidden in the Word.

As you read this book, keep in mind that, in the Scriptures, genuine knowledge of God cannot just be theoretical but involves the loving engagement of the whole person (the Hebrew word yada, "to know," is far richer than the Greek). Knowledge of God can only come about through direct contact with God himself. For example, there is a world of difference between describing the attributes of God theoretically and actually experiencing those things in our daily lives in such a way that they change us. In this latter sense, we know God and are known by him at the same time. To allow the content of this book to have this effect on you, we encourage you to read it on your knees. Prayerfully seek to attune yourself with what God is revealing to you through these pages. This will allow you to look again … to reframe.

Although we offer a distinctly biblical understanding of metanoia in the book, we want to also acknowledge that metanoia is by no means exclusively a Christian concept. While the word (and the concept) originate in ancient Greek, it is also experienced in all major religious traditions. The idea of paradigm shift (even if they actually use that term) is found in the secular marketplace, from Thomas Kuhn to Fritjof Capra, among others. As such we will refer to them throughout.

Adopting the language of leadership and organization, this book outlines a comprehensive “theory of change”—essentially how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a particular context. There is much to learn from the social sciences and organizational psychology in this regard.

Because of the way we use theological and sociological material, and because of the relative unfamiliarity with the depth of meanings inherent in the biblical theology of conversion and repentance, this book will require some mental effort on your part.

Contrary to our culture of quick reads and quick fixes, we encourage you to slow down, to look again, to break through the veil of familiarity you may have with these ideas. The teaching on repentance is a case in point. Although it's been in the Bible all along, it has all too rarely been understood in the way that Scripture itself intended. So we encourage you to be patient with the text.

## A BRIEFING FOR THE (METANOIC) JOURNEY

### Change in Two Dimensions (Personal and Collective)

In all genuinely biblical forms of spirituality, the personal encounter with God must inevitably lead to loving action in the world. When we wrestle with deep, transformational change at the personal level, we will become the kind of leaders who are able to deal with the exponentially more complex transformation required at the collective level—in the organizations we lead. This book will therefore seek to address metanoia in both the personal and the collective dimensions. It was psychologist Carl Rogers who famously noted that “what is most personal is most general.” This is not only true for psychology but is also particularly true for spirituality, be it individual or communal. Henri Nouwen extrapolates,

Anyone trying to live a spiritual life will soon discover that the most personal and the most solitary is the most communal. What we live in the most intimate areas of our existence is of the greatest importance to others … why our inner lives are lives for others … why our most secret thoughts affect our community.6

Contemplation of God is the discipline that makes the heavenly dimension and truth of the Christian life present in the life of the disciple.

What arises from these prayers is simply the working out of this truth in the transient conditions of this world.7 In our deepest self-reflection, we discover that the roots of our personal problems are the same as those that permeate a sick society. In our personal struggle with brokenness, we cannot but become critics of the prevailing social order. On the other hand, as revolutionaries struggling to bring about a new world order, we will find that we are also fighting the same reactionary fears and false ambitions in ourselves that are laced throughout society. And so we soon discover that we cannot change the world without seeking to change ourselves. "Therefore, every true disciple is called to be a revolutionary at heart; the one who walks the way of Jesus is called to unmask the illusory quality of human society."8

Because these things are true, we will sometimes call for a personal experience of the joy of metanoia as we seek to follow Jesus in discipleship, and at other times we will highlight the need for collective (be it church or organization) conversion. These are two sides of the same coin, which means that the process we suggest for one applies equally to the other. This is clearly reflected in the Lord's Prayer, where we are called to pray for the forgiveness of the sins of the heart as well as the sins of the whole collective. This two-dimensional approach to metanoia is critical, and we raise it now to guide you as you read.

## Other Quirks of Style

Consistent with much of my previous writing, there are extensive endnotes throughout thebook. This is meant to provide a deeper rationale to the concept being explored as well as stimulation for further study. We hope they will prove a fruitful resource to those wishing to pursue the topic at hand.

Throughout the book, we use the forward slash “/” to force double play on certain words—for example un/learn, re/define, re/calibrate. This is a deliberate technique so that the text is read more like poetry, enabling

## Overview of Contents

This book seeks to articulate a thoroughgoing understanding of metanoia, why it is critical, how it works, and suggests ways it can be implemented.

  Part one focuses on the theological and sociological basis of metanoia
  and why it is critical for both an ongoing relationship with God and for our
  fruitfulness—whether as an individual disciple or as part of a collective.

We will focus not only on the serious challenge that repentance is to our current ways of thinking and acting but also on the incredible blessings A BRIEFING FOR THE (METANOIC) JOURNEY xxix it brings—the mind-blowing, vision-enhancing, spiritually rich life God intended for us as his people.

  Part two focuses on providing a model of metanoia that is entirely
  consistent with the content of part one, but that has been tried and tested

Part One

## Why Metanoia

  In part one of this book, we propose a thorough framework for why
  metanoia is crucial for Christians in any era—but particularly in ours.

  We lament deeply that a genuinely biblical understanding of metanoia
  has been all but forgotten by large swathes of the church in the West.

Certainly, our (Protestant) traditions passed on a highly reduced understanding of metanoia. How it is that we have managed to bypass, or even actively suppress, the incredible revelation given to the church on this vital topic? Much frustration could have been avoided if we realized that God has indeed bequeathed to us a potent avenue of change built into the faith itself. Missing this has been disastrous in the life of the disciple, but perhaps even more so for the communities that are called to be the dynamic presence of Jesus in the world.

  About a decade ago, I (Alan) cofounded a program that aimed to
  help a group of megachurches adopt a scalable and disciple-reproducing
  model. We took roughly 250 large churches through the program in
  it made precious little difference on the ground. Although most of the
  cation movements, they tended to lean toward a more pragmatic style
  mental mapping needed to inform and sustain significant organizational
  paradigm shifts often lacked the deeply spiritual, transformational
  importance of unlearning as a precondition for new learning, nor did
  genuinely paradigmatic change. In other words, we failed largely because

  For the benefit of all involved, I hope to never make that mistake

  again. All my work with organizations and leaders is now predicated on
  zational re/design and leadership, I now encourage participants to take
  holders in the legacy system, of the often unspoken assumptions built into
  of the many hindrances to movement that are latent in the culture and
  zation. This is only the beginning of the process, but it is an essential part.

We are beginning to see evidence of real change, as viable movements emerge from this challenging and disruptive season in which we find ourselves.1

  In our work, we have found that individuals and leaders (and their
  organizations) who are willing to explore and appropriate the sheer
  grace of metanoia find themselves ushered into a place of new possibi-
  explore, is that metanoia involves having a radically open mind. From
  form of sanctification—the process of being increasingly attuned to God
  increased conformity to the human archetype of Jesus (God’s way of
  of letting go and letting be. It is not only entry to the kingdom of God that
  (Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18). Metanoia is, and ought to be, integ-

  In our work with organizations seeking to embrace the mission of the
  church, we believe the stifling status quo is caused partly by our inability
  to bypass obsolete ideas and practices and to instead tap into better, more
  and more besides, require metanoia—paradigm shift and conversions

## A Briefing for the (Metanoic) Journey

At the collective level, metanoia ushers the organization into becoming what social scientists call a “learning organization”—an organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and at modifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights.

Clearly, new ideas are essential if any learning is to take place, but these can only be accessed and appropriated through the collective un/learning that takes place in a genuinely metanoic process. The basis of this will be laid out in part one. We will start with an exploration of why metanoia is particularly appropriate in these apocalyptic times (chapter one); we will provide rich definition and nuance to the biblical teaching on topic in chapter two; chapter three will give a comprehensive rationale as to why metanoia is critical across the system and throughout life; chapter four will show how metanoia leads us into seeing the world through the mind of Christ; and chapter five will propose an “anthropology of the heart” and why it is critical to bring the mind, soul, and will into the equation of transformational change. By the end of part one, it should be clear that change is not only possible but necessary to the life of faith as well as to the effective missional impact of the church.
