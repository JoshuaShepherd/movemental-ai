# Chapter Five: Wholehearted Metanoia Activating Mind, Soul, and Will
  To experience metanoia is to quicken the conscience by the

  holiness of God, to feed the mind with the truth of God, to purge

  love of God, and to devote the will to the purpose of God.

  Faith is a way of experiencing which is undertaken with one’s
  whole being, all out, “with all one’s heart, with all one’s soul,
  and with all one’s might.” Faith is our way of leaning into life.

  And when you return, you will remove every trace of
  idol worship. I will give you a whole heart and a new
  spirit; I will take from you your hearts of stone and give
  my laws and be my people, and I will be your God.

  Jesus wants faith from the heart. He wants the very
  center of our being and not just a couple of nerve-
  twitches from the threshold of our ego.

  We speak of “having a change of heart” so often that the phrase seems
  pretty ordinary—even banal, perhaps. But understood biblically, to have
  a “change of heart”—or similarly “to change your mind”—is not merely

  Having explored the dynamics and definitions of metanoia, as well
  as how it is the gateway to the mind of Christ, we now want to explore
  how this transformation—this change of heart—might take place. We are
  siveness to God; how we might grow as disciples; how we can mature as
  his purposes in our lives.
  We must first tackle the biblical issue of the heart and why it matters

  in determining our identity and our actions. Failure to understand the

  This resistance to change is as old as human organization itself. We
  need only consider Judaism in Jesus’ times to see the reality of religious
  entrenchment. Jesus absolutely requires metanoia as a precondition to
  him (Mark 1:15). As we have seen, without repentance, Israel was effec-

  Once again, we encourage the reader to constantly apply the ideas in
  this book, both individually (as a disciple) and collectively (as a leader).

Resist the temptation to read the Bible individualistically. Remember, it is primarily directed at communities (for example, Israel and church) and only at individuals in and through them. It is only when we read the Bible in this way that we can feel the profound significance of the biblical teaching for personal life as well as whole societies. In the end, all the desires, longings, and plans associated with all that is human are issues of the heart—individual and/or collective—and so, if we are to experience some level of transformation at all, we will need to get a handle on the heart and how it works.

  God Wants (to Change) Your Heart

Woven into the revelatory fabric of the Bible is an unavoidable and consistent appeal for a wholehearted change. The primary words for “heart” in the Scriptures (leb in Hebrew and kardia in Greek) occur over 750 times. Teaching about the heart is therefore not incidental and cannot be overlooked if we are to understand both the nature of revelation and our human response. Very rarely is the word “heart” used to refer to the actual physical organ that pumps our blood. In other words, it is primarily used as a metaphor. This gives the concept profound significance, delivering invaluable insights for biblical anthropology, psychology, and spirituality.3

  Our understanding of the heart is particularly significant in relation
  to the knowledge of God … theology. Thinking about God is so closely
  wedded to the heart that an understanding of one is quite impossible
  mation about God giving his people (note the collective dimension) a
  circumcising the heart (Deuteronomy 10:16, 30:6; Romans 2:25–29).

Both examples demonstrate the critical role of the heart in authentic human response and responsibility, in the ongoing covenantal relationship between God and his people, in regeneration, and in ongoing worship.

  The heart is also the seat of understanding, the source of thought
  and reflection, as well as the root of the will and therefore the origin of
  all resolve.4 In other words, the heart is the real source of all significant

  others. Each desire represents a lord; many lords are therefore at work in

  Seen in this light, the heart is a complex battlefield. Because it is the
  hidden source of all thought, desire, volition, loyalty, and hope, it can
  readily become the scene of deadly conflicts, as one desire competes with

It is the source of both good and evil; therefore, failure to understand or master it can be catastrophic. Dedicating your heart to some cause can create not only great mathematicians and saints but also Nazis and suicide bombers.7

  And so when God effectively says, “Give me your heart” (e. g., Joel
  2:12–13), he is saying, “Give me your internal reality; give me the source
  of your imagination—the root of your capacity for image making and
  your passions and your evil urges.” It appears that if God can get our heart,
  consciousness, and experience. It is as if God says to humanity, “When
  authentic change and deeply spiritual connection with God is therefore

  Before we explore the multi-dimensional nature of the heart, it’s
  important for us as Westerners to appreciate how we tend to limit the
  heart to the realm of emotions (notice how we express this reduction in
  the emotional/affective dimension is a key function of the heart, the

  beyond this understanding. So when the Bible talks about the heart, it

## One Heart in Three Dimensions

In the Scriptures, the heart is made up of at least three discernible, but profoundly interrelated, dimensions: mind, soul, and will.

  Although these components have some areas of functional overlap,
  each comprise discrete elements that together form the whole heart.

For the biblical writers, human transformation takes place through the uniting of the disparate elements of mind/intellect, soul/pathos, and will/ free choice, in such a way that engages the whole human being at the very core of his or her consciousness. Likewise, throughout Christian history, faith has been represented as notitia (the intellectual element), assensus (the emotional element), and fiducia (the volitional element).

These together comprise a holistic, three-dimensional understanding of faith and correspond directly to the three-dimensional model of the heart presented here.10

  Consider the following diagram, which locates wholeheartedness in
  the intersection of all three separate dimensions. The more these inter-
  penetrate and coalesce around the center, the more wholehearted is the
  integrated—so that all that can be seen is “the heart.”

  mind/paradigm) primary love)

  Once again, we must recognize both individual and corporate dimen-
  sions of the model above. The local church—or any organization because
  of their collective nature as extensions of human life—can exhibit a divided

  It is important to keep in mind the primary and holistic nature of

  the heart if we are to understand and experience radical metanoia. The
  relationship of wholeheartedness to the transcendentals of being.) In the
  toward greater individual and collective wholeheartedness.

## The Mind and Mindfulness

We noted in chapter two that in the Scriptures the words “nous-noia”— commonly translated as “mind”—do not primarily refer to the physical organ of thought (i. e., the brain) but are best understood as a certain way of thinking, a rationality, or a mindset. The mind is that part of us that receives, assimilates, and makes sense of our experience of the world, whether spiritual or material.11

  Because the mind is an inseparable dimension of the heart, any
  change of mind involves a change of heart, and every change of heart is
  soon a change of mind.12 The heart is not governed by mindless emotion
  intellect, especially when it is integrated with the mind of Christ.13
  If transformation and paradigm shift are to take place, it is critical to

  address the prevailing rationality of the individual or group and do the
  without this. As we have already noted, authentic metanoia involves
  of seeing the world—adopting a new mental map.14
  Being conscious of, and actively rescripting, this mental map is a

  critical part of the wholehearted change process. Aconstant reassessment
  therefore essential for transformational change. To leave the mind out of

  answer) questions like, Why are we doing this? What is the meaning of
  ities involved? Is what I am doing built on truth, or is it a deception?
  Being mindless works against the intelligence needed to adapt to the

  challenges of life and leadership.

## The Soul and Soulfulness

Because the concept of the soul is particularly elusive, it warrants more clarification than the mind or the will. In Scripture, the terms for “soul” (nephesh, ruach, psyche) have a broad range of metaphorical meanings and can be variously translated—depending on the context—as “soul,” “life,” “consciousness,” “person,” “appetite,” “desire,” “emotion,” “passion,” and so forth. But importantly, the soul represents the animating principle of life—its “spirit”—and so it is sometimes used synonymously with the idea of spirit.15

  The soul is also strongly associated with pathos; those aspects of
  human life that enthrall, that involve eros, empathy, compassion, and
  sympathy. The soul is the seat of the restless yearnings that inform the
  and salvation. These yearnings drive and motivate our greatest endeavors.

Furthermore (as Augustine well understood) the psyche is that part of us that is mysteriously drawn to the infinite; and thus it is the soul that senses, and responds to, the sacred in all things. It is therefore from the soul that all great art is generated.

  The soul is also linked with the senses and therefore forms the basis
  of our primary experience of the world; that part of us that hears, tastes,
  feels, and sees.16 When the senses are properly rooted in the heart, life will
  personal acts of the whole human.17 Humans have peak experiences when
  encountering beautiful art, music, or nature.
  James Hillman, a psychologist who has sought to understand

  the nature and dynamics of the soul, says that the soul generally
  is awoken in moments of crisis that break the routine. For Hillman,
  that is realized in reflective speculation, dream, image, and fantasy.18
  or soul.
  In relation to motivational dimensions of the soul, eighteenth-

  century preacher and theologian Jonathan Edwards sought to articulate
  soul. Edwards’s famous treatise on the religious affections (that which
  Christian conversion, no less. He maintained that if the soul is left
  will take place.
  I am bold in saying this, but I believe that no one is ever changed, either
  by doctrine, by hearing the word, or by the preaching or teaching of
  a word, there is never any great achievement by the things of religion
  in the affections.19

Soulfulness, it appears, can be developed when individuals and communities live out their values and beliefs, and in so doing demonstrate sensitivity to God and his purposes for the world. To “have soul” therefore means to live from the inside out—where the outside is consistent with the inside.

It is to wear your heart on your sleeve—being genuinely unpretentious.

It means to have integrity, presence, gravitas. It is even said that in true love, the soul of a person envelops their body, which is why saints are often depicted with auras or halos.20 Our great saints, our heroes in the faith, are inevitably those people who lived their messages with soul. I (Alan) recently met with the leaders of a remarkable Catholic lay movement called the Focalare Movement. These people did not need to say much about their organization. In one of the most compelling encounters I have had with Jesus in and with his people, I could feel what I can only describe as “Jesusenergy” in their very presence. Their soulful gravitas worked its magic on me, as I am now fascinated with this remarkable movement.

  Organizations that have soul have a certain personality—a vibe, a
  feel, a mood. They too wear their beliefs on the outside for all to see.
  soulful church, therefore, is one that reverberates with the presence of

  Activating the soul is therefore essential for the idea of wholehearted,
  lasting, metanoic transformation. Without bringing the soul into the equation,
  we will not only be soul-less, but we will also be half-hearted at best, heart-less
  commitment required for transformation—our hearts, will not “be in it.”
  It is not revolutions and upheavals That clear the road to new and better days,
  But revelations, lavishness and torments

  The passionate pursuit of a goal alters the structure of reality.

## The Will and Decisiveness

Perhaps getting a biblical handle on what is meant by the will is the easiest task in describing this anthropology of the heart. The soul and the mind tend to hide in plain sight, more on the level of un/consciousness and indescribable yearning. However, the will is much more evident. Every day, we feel the impact of our own choices, as well as those made by others. Acts of kindness are a case in point. We benefit from other people’s positive choices to serve and love. But we also experience negative examples of the will. I deologically driven politics are an obvious, and all too contemporary, example. You don’t have to look too far to see this. Just think of the power politics at play in countries across the globe over recent years, as well as throughout history. What is patently clear is that we all have a will, and that it plays a large part in all our lives, for good or ill.

  Dallas Willard says that will, or choice, involves the capacity of the
  person to originate things and events that would not otherwise be or
  occur.22 This ability to “originate” things and events arises from human
  before God requires responsibility, direction, and choice. To choose God

  Our ability to choose is part of what it means to be created in the image
  and likeness of God. As humans, we can and must choose. In this way we
  can alter the course of our lives and determine something of our destiny
  gift of free will.” It is a gift because it opens us to all kinds of possibilities;
  the uniquely human capacity to be proactive, to initiate, to create, to bring

  It’s not just our active choices that can create problems for us and
  others around us; passivity and indecision (the unwillingness to make a
  choice) can also cause all sorts of issues. Sins of omission can be just as
  (acedia) and decisionlessness to be the root of sin.23 Martin Buber says
  our problems with evil.24 Passivity clearly plays a role in various psycho-
  oppression and bondage, where humans relinquish their freedom to, and
  nature of spiritual deliverance often say that demonic oppression derives

  In this sense, full-on repentance—transformative change, conver-
  sion—requires definite actions of the will, along with the ability to be
  strategic and proactive, to reset the direction of our lives, and to make an
  and by responding, that we can create new futures. God’s kingdom comes

## The Symphony of a Whole Heart

The three-dimensional model of the heart is clearly evident in Israel’s Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4–9, which is confirmed and supplemented in Jesus summation of the Torah and the greatest commandments—the call to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength [will]” (Mark 12:30).25 When we integrate and unify the dimensions of the heart—soul, mind, and strength (will)—in what we have named as wholeheartedness, we can truly love and worship the One God.26 By leaving any of these out of the equation, we can neither experience a true love of God nor fully undergo the deep metanoic change that comes with such an experience.27

  Throughout history, various Christian traditions have sought to
  incorporate the three-dimensional understanding of the heart into their
  prayer, worship, and practice. Orthodox theologians, for example, speak
  offering of the whole person—intellect, reason, will, and affections—as

  The human heart—comprising mind, soul, and will—is the executive
  center of an individual’s life.29 In other words, it is the place of action
  where ideas and intentions, plans and passions are implemented. “The
  is its function.”30 Furthermore, because the heart integrates the intellect,
  fundamental to human perception itself.
  Our feelings are the way in which the heart integrates and unifies all

  that we engage with in life. As the activity of the heart, feelings are not to
  as in any way inferior to them. Feelings are the integration of all human

  All three dimensions of the heart presuppose and ground one another.

They are interrelated and cannot give their true contribution without being informed and impacted by the others. The mind needs the soul, which needs the will, which needs the mind, which needs the … and so forth. The more we can integrate these three dimensions, the more we can experience a transformed, changed, metanoic heart—a heart aligned with God’s purposes and focus for our lives. Conversely, the more fragmented the heart, the more dysfunctional our lives will be.

## The Pain of a Broken Heart

The problem of the “broken” heart—our incapacity to bring our whole heart to what we are doing—lies at the core of our broken lives and systems. This is because at least one of the three dimensions that bring metanoic transformation of the heart is missing from the equation. The broken (divided) heart is a heart confused by too many alternatives and is therefore unable to employ its integrative power.

  Like a body whose core functions are at odds with one another, the
  half-hearted, double-minded, indecisive person/organization is out of

  Think about the people or organizations you know that exhibit a
  whole heart. I (Alan) immediately think of Christine Caine, one of my
  dear friends and heroes, who founded Equip & Empower Ministries,
  Christine as a wholehearted person. She is brimful of “soul” and passion
  formation. She is exceptionally smart, carefully considers things, and
  sticks with. Because she is so radically open, critically aware, and predis-

  An important aside here regarding women and wholeheartedness:
  In my (Alan) experience, women are usually much better at integrating
  mind, soul, and will, partly because they don’t tend to compartmentalize
  anointed Jesus with perfume with the religious elite who watched her.

They sat at a safe distance, arms likely crossed, and assessed the incident rationally. She, on the other hand, engaged with heart, mind, body—as a whole person. She’s the one who Jesus praised and whose story has been told through the ages (Mark 14:3–9; John 12:1–8).33 There is much to learn from women in this regard. For instance, I was recently talking to a female colleague about how difficult it is for me to experience wholeheartedness, that I tend to engage primarily in one dimension. She said that the best way to integrate all three at once is to shed a tear because when we cry, all the pieces of the heart (as well as the two sides of the brain) come together. This tallied with my experience; most of my major metanoic/conversion/repentance moments have involved weeping.

  Conversely, we can all recall people who operate from a fragmented
  center. For instance, we likely know individuals who are passionate for
  God and are even willing to make costly choices for him based on that
  good intentions, they tend to create chaos wherever they go.
  The same, of course, can be true of organizations. Some are overly

  We need to bring all these dimensions together. And here we arrive at the idea of wholeheartedness.

## A Model of Wholehearted Change

As part of the training systems of MLC, my dear friend and colleague Rich Robinson and I (Alan) developed a comprehensive model for understanding the wholehearted, transformative change process. It is incorporated in the model of personal and organizational change that we will elaborate on in chapters six to nine. Here, we simply address the matter of the heart as it relates to metanoic, transformational change, using the framework of mind-power, soul-power and will-power.

## Activating Mind-Power

Leaders seeking to activate mind-power need to be proactive in helping their organizations consciously identify the ideas that drive them, evaluate whether these ideas are still valid, and, where necessary, discover and implement new ones. Once there is awareness of the relative strengths and weaknesses in the group, leaders will also need to facilitate the necessary unlearning so that members can readily adopt new ideas and pathways.

Failure to do this will leave entrenched thought and behavioral patterns in place.

  We need to be aware of our foundational ideas and principles—
  what MLC refers to as meta-ideas.35 This is particularly important
  for ecclesial organizations, where core theology is critical in
  with the Christo-logic gifted to them in Jesus; and if they have an
  they should be able to discern the foundational ideas and how they
  meta-ideas accurately, they will need to engage in intelligent reading
  break from overfamiliarity with previous ideas. They will also need to
  and digests information. (See appendix six on upstream-downstream

  The processes above apply equally to the individual, except that the
  application is more personal. Essentially, we need to become increa-
  singly self-aware, develop our critical-thinking abilities, and commit

This can be achieved, for example, by dialoguing in book clubs; by committing to reading the thought-leaders in any field, even if it means learning whole new vocabularies; by learning to ask poignant questions and following through in a quest to answer them; and by limiting consumption of TV and other media that dumb us down and generate passivity. Always remember that the word “disciple” in the Greek (matheiteis) means learner or student, and so whatever else it means, it involves growing in wisdom and understanding. There can be no dodging or outsourcing our thinking if we are to mature as lifelong disciples of King Jesus.

## Activating Soul-Power

As we have seen, the soul of an organization embodies the vibe or atmosphere of the organization—in effect, its resonant culture. Culture, as a dimension of the soul or spirit of the organization, acts like an invisible force field that influences everything we do. Leadership expert Peter Drucker reputedly remarked that culture eats strategy for breakfast. If this is the case, we are wise not to leave it unattended. Activating soul-power will require a significant focus on the issues of culture and its impact on the organization.

  Organizational behaviorists have long taught that organizations are
  laced with invisible cultural elements—actions, values, language, symbols,
  purpose, and ethos. We are often blind to these forces of culture around

Newcomers approaching the ambit of an organization readily perceive its vibe and can feel constrained to behave in certain ways, even though no one explicitly tells them how to do so.37

  The outward expression of an individual soul can be detected by
  looking at what is loved and desired because the soul arouses passions
  and focuses motivation. Soul is also evident in the core values of
  passionate commitment and allegiance, guides behavior, shapes thinking,

  Without a resonant soul-power, the organization will over rely on
  power and rules to try to maintain itself. However, using this approach, it
  is unlikely to sustain itself over the long term and will inevitably languish
  critical in revitalizing organizations.
  Leaders should understand what gets people in the organization

  interested, what activates them, what makes them sad or happy. What

We suggest that organization, as well as the artifacts within it (for example, buildings, music, art pieces) seek to be more artful, beautiful, and culturally resonant. The core values should not appeal just to the head but should also move the soul, making people feel things deeply.

## Activating Will-Power

Passivity and indecision can be a significant problem for individuals as well as organizations. Churches or denominations that are full of complacent individuals have trouble getting anything done. There are many reasons for this complacency, but inevitably it involves some disorder of the will that leads to an inability to make meaningful choices and stick with them.38 In Christian organizations, this results in a culture of resistance to the demands of the kingdom of God—a serious spiritual malady that will frustrate God’s purposes in and through his people. Repentance will therefore inevitably involve obedience and a willful resolve to act in accordance with God’s will.

  Another disorder of the will manifests itself when individuals or
  collectives make many decisions, but they are haphazard and seem to
  have little lasting impact. What is lacking is a discernible, strategic plan
  ration and hopelessness, which leads to further passivity and inactivity.
  In order to focus the organization’s sense of will, we suggest that

  leaders consider issues strategically. What decisions made here and now
  organization, and how can you allocate resources to achieve these? Have
  those you fail to make.

## All Together Now

Again, this comprehensive model of wholeheartedness will be built into the processes of metanoia that are explored in part two.

  For now, try doing a quick test on 1) yourself and 2) your church or
  organization, to get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of each. Use
  the results to develop a pathway to strengthen the areas that prevent you

## Mind Soul 5 5

## Will

Unification of the heart and its direction toward God is how we are to love God, and it lies at the very heart of the biblical worldview. When Jesus said, “Blessed are the pure of heart for they shall see God” (Matthew 5:8), he was not only referring to the importance of personal holiness but also alluding to the biblical idea of being single-hearted. To be pure of heart means to have an undivided heart. As we have already noted, according to the monotheistic logic of the Shema, all the forces of human life (soul, mind, strength) are to be focused on the One God and not dispersed among many idols and ideologies that appeal to our hearts. We can only know and love God by integrating the disparate forces of the heart and directing these toward the One.39 According to Jesus, it is only those who have undivided and simple hearts who are able to understand, to look upon, experience, perceive, and discern God.40

  Wholeheartedness—corporate and individual—is essential to
  metanoia, and metanoia in turn is essential to our knowledge of God.
