Part Two

# How Metanoia

  We now come to the second, more practical, section of thebook. This
  content is derived from a process designed by Rich Robinson and
  myself (Alan) as a vital part of our work in MLC. In the chapters that
  organizations to bear, adding credibility and experience to the process.

To be clear, MLC exists to help churches and Christian organizations become more movemental, and in doing so to have greater transformational impact. This process—what we here call the “Metanoia Journey”—has now been built into all our leadership development training, including our Movement Labs, the Starfish and the Spirit Accelerator, the mDNA Accelerator, The City Movement platforms, and the 5QChurch Planting Cohort.1 It has, in turn, been embedded into many of the processes of the various movements we work with, including New Thing, City Leaders Collective, The Underground Network, Redeemer City to City, For Charlotte Network, The Salvation Army, and others.

  We say this to demonstrate that metanoia is not simply a theoretical
  exercise. What follows incorporates all the core ideas in this book—
  metanoia as paradigm shift and re/learning, as participation in the
  in an active process that will deliver real, enduring, and deeply spiritual
  un/learning that will make space for the process that follows; chapter
  conscious clarity about the organization’s mental model/map as well as
  the platform of change through which the culture and structures prede-
  practices, and algorithms that shape the whole life of the organism/

  Before we dig into the content of the Metanoia Journey, it’s
  important to state that, in line with the purpose of this book to provide a
  thorough conceptual framework for metanoia as a whole, what we offer
  description of it. The nuts and bolts will be provided in the associated
  offered by MLC. Therefore, please read these chapters as something of
  enable change.
  As we have already explored, metanoia is essential to any ongoing

  growth as disciples of Jesus, and the exact same metanoic process involved
  needed for individuals to grow, adapt, and change mirrors the process that
  is a skill that leaders need if they are to not only disciple individuals but
  and attunement with God and his purposes in the world. If change and
  discipleship, our religion will always end up protecting the status quo as

  We have already noted that transforming a whole organization is
  far more complicated than changing an individual—and that is difficult
  enough. Even revamping a small traditional church is extremely
  a movement tend to institutionalize in order to sustain themselves.

I nstitutions are almost always conservative agencies, designed to preserve the status quo and to resist regular adaptation and change.3 Of course, movements must be embodied in some form of organization, but once we begin to think of the church primarily in terms of organizational structure, it becomes one of the very principalities and powers that the gospel is supposed to withstand.4 However, as we have already stated, in these VUCA times, the ability to innovate and adapt is absolutely critical to organizational survival. Under such conditions, leaders who lack an understanding of the complexities of change, and have no workable process of metanoia, will either be finally expelled from the organization or will be unable to fundamentally alter its trajectory of decline.

## The Way of Un/learning

Humans almost always resist change. Part of the reason for this is that organizational insiders, and especially leaders, are the key beneficiaries of the current system and tend to work to maintain it. The existing paradigm therefore becomes something of a mental (and spiritual) prison of selfinduced repetitiveness and bias. These are the deep, often unconscious, reasons for resistance to change, and so embarking on a process of transformation requires a fair bit of courage and a whole lot of self-insight. We need to unlearn a lot, it seems, to get back to that foundational life which is “hidden in God” (Colossians 3:3). Yes, transformation is often more about unlearning than learning, which is why we call it “conversion” or “repentance.”

  It’s also important to understand and acknowledge the reality
  of spiritual warfare behind intransigence in the form of powers and
  principalities that seek to bind human behaviors through ideology,
  (the “elemental spirits/principles”) are the foundation of the religious,
  to life. They assume spiritual power when people give their allegiance to

They enslave people, and religious institutions tend to be laden with them (Galatians 4:8–11). Paul warns us to not submit to the stoichea, expressed in human rules and religious ritual such as “Do not handle!

Do not taste! Do not touch!” (Colossians 2:21). I nstitutions can have a “life” of their own and are often opposed to God’s purposes. Leaders trying to help the church get back on a missional footing will need great spiritual discernment and a commitment to prayer because the struggle to advance the kingdom of God is not just a human battle but a spiritual one (Ephesians 6:12).

  transformation. The U-shape of the curve suggests we can only learn if

By doing so, we can emerge on the other side with a renewed ability to achieve our mission. This metanoic process releases individuals and the organization from cycles of brokenness and rehabituates them to patterns more consistent with Jesus and his cause.

  This notion of un/learning is consistent with the ancient unders-
  tanding of how we can know God. Theologians have long talked
  about the way of negation and unknowing (the via negativa or the
  positiva or the kataphatic way). At different times, and for different
  God.

## The Hero’s Journey

Awillingness to trek through the valley follows the same archetypal pattern in the now universally recognized “hero’s journey,” which informs most of the defining narratives in human culture and religion. On this expedition, the hero is commissioned to undertake an arduous journey, during which they will undergo significant testing and existential struggle to eventually, and against all odds, emerge victorious and solve the threat to broader society. This pattern is not only found in myth and popular storytelling but can also be seen in the lives of many of the biblical heroes, including Abraham, Moses, Jeremiah, Mary, and Paul—but supremely in the life and ministry of the Arch Hero of the story, Jesus himself. The sending of the Son of God, his incarnation, his ministry, rejection by his people, the existential struggle in his passion, death, his victory in the resurrection, and the return to a new reality in the ascension—all follow this U-shaped journey, which results in Jesus bringing salvation to the world.6 As we saw in chapter four, metanoia follows the pattern of Christ’s life (incarnation, life, cross, and resurrection) and in so doing brings us in sync with the mind of Christ. There must be no avoiding metanoia—and the hero’s journey we must take—if we are to be consistent to Jesus’ “way.” The hero’s journey as a Metanoic Journey can be readily seen in the following diagram, which is based on Joseph Campbell’s classic monomyth.7

Developmental psychology also asserts that learning is achieved through an undulating U-shaped pattern that involves consecutive un/learning and re/learning phases. The U-shaped curve (also called a sigmoid curve) charts the process proposed by seminal educational philosophers and developmental psychologists such as Jean Piaget, Kurt Fischer, Lawrence Kohlberg, and Carol Gilligan, among others, as well as organizational theorists like David Kaufer, Otto Sharmer, and Peter Senge. Is it any wonder that the greatest teacher of all time, Jesus, used this same pattern in the transformative journey God designed for us as his image bearers, and by extension our organizations?

Journey Like Your Life Depends on It

As you begin the Metanoia Journey, it is imperative that you approach it as a quest in which everything important to you and your organization is at stake. In ways we are not always aware of, this really is already the truth of the situation. There can be no return to some form of an idealized past.

There must be no more doubling down on attractional strategies if we want to achieve missional outcomes. It is a time of significant liminality.9 If we don’t change our systems and paradigms now, in this wet-cement cultural/apocalyptic moment, it is likely our standard organizations will eventually break down.

We must now search for a better way to be faithful witnesses of the kingdom. The journey into the future of the church can be understood as something of a pilgrimage—a liminal journey that takes us deeper into the heart of God and his purposes. Under similar conditions, if it doesn't kill you, it will make you stronger.

Liminality, negotiated faithfully, really can be good for the mind, soul, and will. Therefore, engage with the liminality by being willing to live like a vagabond, as an itinerant on the road. Be desperate! Don’t even bother to take a change of clothes, let alone food for the journey. Learn to depend on God’s provision and guidance as you go (Luke 10:1–20). You should feel the all-too-real risk of failure—this will motivate you in ways you cannot even now imagine. Abandon the concept of “failure is not an option,” recognizing that failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it.

Engage with the risk; let the liminality teach you what only liminality can.

“Fill the gaps! Stay liquid! Survive!”11

Any attempt to change the trajectory of any organization—and perhaps especially the church—remains a tough challenge. But there are significant signs of hope among the ashes. If we are willing to unlearn, relearn, and rebuild a viable organization from there, we will not only see transformation in our organizations, we will also know God in a deeper and more profound way.

"It's the economy, stupid" was Bill Clinton's slogan when he successfully ran for the White House in 1992. The US was experiencing an economic downturn, and many voters felt the incumbent president was out of touch with the needs of ordinary Americans. Clinton's campaign team hammered home the message about the economy every chance they got—the slogan was even framed and hung in their campaign headquarters.

We want to co-opt that saying and claim (with all due respect), "It's the system, stupid." By this, we mean it is impossible to correct the almost universal decline of the church in the Western world without grappling with the systemic nature of the problem. Failure to address the systemic nature of the problem will mean that all attempts to resolve it will be superficial and ultimately ineffectual. As Robert Pirsig famously stated, "But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible. The attack must be directed against the construction of thought itself, rationality itself. If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced that factory is left intact, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government."

Witness, for instance, the failure of the democratic Arab Spring movement to overthrow systems of autocracy throughout the Middle East. Similarly, this inability to dethrone deeply entrenched systems of Christendom has been the story of the church for far too long. In the last few decades, leaders have sought to weaken the stranglehold with church-growth methodology, which has only further entrenched attractional paradigms and intensified the problem. For all the techniques and plug-and-play solutions adapted from various “successful” megachurch models, the fundamental Christendom paradigm has been left untouched.2 This is evident in the panic-driven attempt to return to what was considered the “normal” church expression in the aftermath of the highly disruptive COVID-19 pandemic. But those who did this simply kicked the can down the road and will eventually have to deal with the problems of the system. The reality remains: If leaders fail to change the operating system of the organization itself, then anything we do is just a Band-Aid and, in the end, nothing will change. We must therefore dig down to the very roots of the problem; we need to get to the core of the system itself, and from there we must take responsibility for reconfiguring it.

## The Downcurve (To Un/learn)

Leaders need to both understand the transformative power of metanoia and have a process by which they can guide the organization through meaningful, deep, spiritual change. The Metanoia Journey is precisely the kind of tool needed. As noted, many attempts at generating movements focus on a re/learning design process on the upcurve. However, what is critically lacking is the un/learning process of the downcurve. Without this, no real change can take place. The primary template of the organization remains deeply entrenched and largely invisible to the organizational insiders. Many pragmatic leaders, impatient with concepts, are like Evel Knievel—wanting to “jump the chasm” to avoid the hard learning journey. And, because they are also ardent pragmatists, they are always looking for the quick fix, the plug-and-play app, the seven-step miracle solution. But in so doing, they dodge the painful unraveling necessary to “convert” the organization from a more institutional form to being a more decidedly movemental one. We have seen this played out over many years, and painfully few organizations have attained the prize of being a Jesus movement. It’s impossible to jump over your own shadow, and it’s equally impossible to see transformative change without first doing the deep work of unlearning.

In the biblical way of metanoia, the shortest way to the next mountain peak is down through the valley. The only way up is to go down. We must be willing to descend into the dangerous valley if we are to get to the next peak. We must hit bottom (as the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step process affirms) before we are willing to come to recognize that what really hinders new ways of thinking and acting. Richard Rohr calls this process "falling upward." Leaders or organizations that refuse to go down will eventually become stuck, fearful, and finally obsolete.3

This chapter will focus in some detail on each of the four stages of the downcurve: Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, and Understand. Because we have already explored the theological and spiritual dimensions of metanoia in part one of this book, we will cover these four stages briefly in this chapter. The upcurve—Paradigm, Platform, and Practices—in the following three chapters, along with the conclusion—enables organizations to bake ongoing metanoia into the DNA of the organization and align it to our calling.

## Unravel

The journey to change begins with facing head-on what design thinkers call a “wicked problem.” Wicked problems are those organizational dilemmas that are extremely difficult to solve because of their complex and interconnected nature. They are often not immediately obvious, but even when they are, the potential solutions are not risk-free. The COVID-19 pandemic presented something of a wicked problem to many established organizations (for example, hospitality, airlines, supermarkets, healthcare, and churches). Other examples of complex wicked problems are climate change, global poverty, and homelessness.

But there is a somewhat paradoxical dimension of a wicked problem in that although it can threaten to undo the organization if it is not properly addressed and resolved, if a solution can be found, it promises to make the organization stronger and more effective than ever before. In other words, solving a wicked problem brings with it the potential for exponential growth and impact.

Wicked problems present an adaptive challenge, which usually comes in one of two forms: 1) as an adapt-or-die scenario, where either a new way of operating must be found or the individual or organization will cease to exist; or 2) as an opportunity to thrive in new ways. In adaptive challenges, the problem is often unknown or hard to identify; the solution likewise is also unknown and therefore requires learning.

Facing the crisis head-on precipitates a search for new and innovative ways of achieving the organization’s purposes—which is why leadership gurus suggest (as we said in chapter one) we should never waste a good crisis. Grappling with a wicked problem ought to trigger the un/learning process that, if followed well, leads to metanoia/paradigm shift, which UNRAVEL PERFORM

To be generative, rather than destructive, a crisis needs to be engaged with the whole heart (mind, soul, will). It must not be avoided. It must be felt as a threat. Only in this way can it galvanize action and initiate a process of un/learning. There must be something of a "coming apart at the seams" if it is to be proved fruitful.

At the Unraveling stage, it is critical to become aware of the anomalies inherent in the prevailing paradigm of the organization. In an earlier chapter, we explored the nature of paradigms in some detail, so here we simply need to affirm that the paradigm is the largely unconscious mental map that guides our thinking and ways of doing things. To unravel means to become conscious of ourselves, to become aware of the obsolete thinking and redundant practices. The crisis forces us to investigate the contours of the predominant mental map—the map that is producing the problems we are now facing.

One of the tools MLC uses to help identify the crisis in the moment is what we call a "pre-mortem." Whereas a post-mortem happens after death, a pre-mortem is a mental exercise where participants imagine the future failure of a project in which they are investing all their energies. Participants visualize the death and anticipate the failure, then try to figure out why and how the project failed. What are they not doing that they should be doing? What are the warning signs of danger? By imaginatively grappling with the demise of the organization before it happens, participants can identify possible ways in which the crisis can be averted by decisions made in the present. This exercise brings remarkable clarity and focus to life!

- At the Unravel stage, key questions to explore might be:

   What does this (or some future crisis) reveal about the fragilities
  own leadership of it?

   As leaders, are we willing to take personal responsibility for our

   Are we resolved to embark on the difficult journey of un/learning
  financial model)?

## Uncover

This stage follows closely that of Unraveling. Having faced (and named) the wicked problem, with all its associated threat and promise, this next stage ought to initiate a quest to both solve the problem and create new possibilities. This quest must be undertaken (as we mentioned in chapter three) with what we call “soft eyes”:

> "You know what you need at a crime scene?... Soft eyes... If you got soft eyes, you can see the whole forest. If you got hard eyes, you stare at the same tree missing the forest... Soft eyes, grasshopper!" (Detective Bunk Moreland, The Wire)

No one is sure of the exact origin of the phrase "soft eyes," but it was popularized by the HBO series The Wire.

Having soft eyes is essential to hunting, detective work, medical diagnosis, and to all new discoveries and learning. In order to see something, we must be willing to "look again" and see it as if for the first time, choosing to defer judgment and remain open. So, for instance, if we look at a crime scene with hard, prejudiced eyes, we are likely to miss the details necessary to solve the crime. Having hard eyes means reaching a conclusion before really seeing the scene.7 Therefore, as you initiate this Metanoic Journey, in which the destiny of your organization is at stake, it's important to ask yourself how much of your thinking and practice has been predetermined by historical processes you have uncritically inherited. The very fact that the Christendom paradigm is still overwhelmingly predominant, even though we have been living in a post-Christendom context for at least two hundred years, ought to be proof of how lacking in self-awareness most of us as church leaders really are. We are part of the system! We must have the courage to look again.

A critical aspect of becoming self-aware (for both individuals and organizations) starts with the recognition that all is not well with the status quo. There are serious threats not just from the changing cultural context but also from within the system itself. An anomaly is that "splinter in the mind" (as it was called in The Matrix) that tells us something is missing or wrong.8 Coming to grips with the anomalies initiates the process of questioning that is the precursor to a new way of seeing the issues and solving the problems. The problem with the Newtonian understanding of the world was that it could not account for certain anomalies that were being observed.

When scientists began to study atoms and what they were made of, they soon realized that they behaved quite differently from how standard cause-and-effect typology would predict. This fundamental anomaly finally led to the birth of a new paradigm called quantum physics, which operates on an entirely different rationality than the preceding paradigm.9

Sensing anomaly is one aspect of what we call upstream processing. If the river runs dry at the bottom of the mountain or it is polluted, you look upstream for the source of the problem. We need to untangle the knots in the system itself. (See appendix six on upstream and downstream processing.) We engage soft eyes to see what God the Designer and what he wants to say, to sense the Spirit's correcting voice, to understand the nature of our particular mission, calling, and design. We try to identify the ways in which we have drifted from God's original intent.

Even more specifically, we aim to uncover the meta-ideas—those foundational concepts on which subsequent thinking is built. (We introduced this concept in chapter five.) Think of a meta-idea as playing a similar role to that of a foundational thinker—for example Einstein in science, Kant or Kierkegaard in philosophy, or Bach in music—whose ideas fundamentally shape the trajectory of their various disciplines. Locating these foundational meta-ideas allows us to impact the system with the least effort. But meta-ideas also help us identify the DNA that will define every aspect of the organization going forward.

This is what we call “fractal organizing,”—a concept we will explore more comprehensively in the upcurve process in the next few chapters.

As examples of powerful meta-ideas, consider those that frame MLC's vision and purpose to engender movemental forms of leadership and organization wherever and whenever we can. To do this we focus on what we call the mDNA (missional DNA)—six core elements that they ensure authentic movement in any context.10 The mDNA are the meta-ideas that inform all our practice. They are:
- Jesus is Lord—a radical and unwavering commitment to Jesus at the center of identity, mission, and purpose. As a meta-idea, this ensures that Christ remains the defining center of everything. Any move away from this defining center will inevitably distort the organization's identity and purpose.

- Discipleship and Disciple-Making—a clearly articulated understanding about the intentional processes that ensure disciple-making happens. This meta-idea determines the focus of effort and thus disciplines the organization to do what it is called to do.

- Missional-Incarnational Impulse—a commitment based on the theological pattern of the missio Dei and the incarnation of Christ that sends the gospel and church into every context. Our greatest theology is missiology. As a meta-idea, this determines and shapes how the organization engages with the world. Without this, organizations don't go anywhere and are stuck with one model of the church.

- APEST Culture—the ministry of Christ expressing itself in and through the body of Christ. APEST forms the latent intelligence needed for healing, fullness, unity, and functional maturity to the organization and the required competencies of its leadership. This meta-idea ensures the full capacity to extend the mission of Christ in the world.

- Organic Systems—the decentralized, networked structure that undergirds transformative movements. Here the organization is designed to reproduce itself across the whole system, from center to edge. As a meta-idea, this ensures that power and function are distributed rather than centralized and will ensure reproduction. Without this meta-idea, we default to means we opt for a high control, centralized, elitist, clerical model rather than empowering all believers as active agents.

- Communitas—the shared experience of journey and ordeal (liminality) that creates a much more vigorous form of community. This meta-idea compels people to regularly take risks together. Liminality is a catalyst for growth and determines the willingness of the organization to engage in, and grow through, challenge. Without this, we default to church as a risk-averse, uncreative, boring Sunday gathering.

The core proposal of my (Alan) book The Forgotten Ways is that, although each of these is highly significant in themselves—and there are others—it is when all six coalesce and inform each other they create a movemental dynamic that is absolutely inevitable. Alignment or misalignment changes the nature of the organization entirely.

Because MLC's vision and purpose is to engender movemental forms of leadership and organization wherever and whenever we can, we ask leaders to assess whether their mindsets and praxis enhance or inhibit movement. Through this analysis, they can begin to see how their core meta-ideas are either supporting or blocking their movemental aspirations. Other meta-ideas (for example, a leadership pipeline, microchurch, or missional community) can be added to enhance the dynamic.

In the living-systems theory of organizations, all living systems are designed for health and flourishing. For example, when you consider your body, if you eat the right kinds of foods and maintain a healthy balance of exercise and rest, your body will thrive and live a fruitful life. If, however, you do things that damage the system, your body will begin to experience some form of disease. In a similar way, Jesus has designed the church to be a movement, and this movemental DNA lies dormant in the heart of every authentic group of believers. Therefore, if the meta-ideas are aligned with movement, movement will happen. For example, if you want your church to be missional/sent ("go to them"), but most of the "mission" is centered on an attractional mindset and praxis ("come to us"), the focus on attractional forms of evangelism will always undermine your capacity to "go." In other words, the "come-to-usness" cancels out your "go-to-them-ness"—it effectively blocks genuine missional engagement. This is a significant problem in the majority of churches that operate largely from the inherited Christendom paradigm of church—a paradigm built squarely on the "come to us" forms of ecclesia. They might believe in sentness/mission, but they never really do it because everything in the system works against it. To see clear indicators of this, just look at the way churches tend to use their buildings and their programming. Everything about the building says, "come to us." Understood in this way, attractional forces are blockers to a genuinely missional paradigm.

A force-field analysis can be applied to any particular organizational vision to see what is either hindering or enhancing it. It ought to be relatively easy to see how metanoia comes into play in this situation. Helping participants identify what is blocking the stated vision invites repentance and new thinking/acting.

Regarding the dynamics of blockers inherent in the system/paradigm, economist John Maynard Keynes wrote these startling words in the introduction to his General Theory:

> The composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape, and so must the reading of it be for most readers if the assault upon them is to be successful—a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression. The ideas which are here expressed so laboriously are extremely simple and should be obvious. The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.11

This escaping of old ideas is no small feat, especially in the case of the church where a deeply embedded Christendom ecclesiology continues to hold sway. In this situation, profoundly obsolete ideas, developed in fundamentally different contexts, continue to shape our mind. We have a lot to unlearn if we are to return to our first love and to the movemental form of church Jesus originally designed.

> Only where the plow of God has tilled our lives can sowing bear fruit. This happens through the plowing of repentance. Therefore our main task is to work for the fundamental transformation of mind and heart.12

We will also need to feel the pain of our intransigence and inability to be what Jesus originally designed us to be. Metanoia will occur when we are willing to experience lament—what our mystics have called "the gift of tears"—because when we cry, we engage both sides of the brain, and the mind is opened to new possibilities. Imagine what corporate lament can do for a community of people! History has noticed that almost all revivals and breakthroughs are accompanied with corporate lament.

- Questions you might ask at the Uncover stage are:
   Having gone through the last few years of cultural upheaval, what
  anomalies have we uncovered in the culture and structures of our
  observations that differ significantly from standard behaviors or
  feel? What are these telling us about the problems inherent in
   Where have we become aware of our unfaithfulness to God’s
  lament these before God and community?
  on which other principles are based? What cornerstone concepts,
  change everywhere) can we name for our organization?
  (practices, habits, or aspects of organizational culture) that are
  change them?

## Unlock

As we have noted, this journey involves something of a spiritual quest for a holy grail of peak performance and transformational impact.

Because it is a profoundly explorative process, we must ourselves become intrepid trailblazers in search of new frontiers, charting the way forward for others to follow. Apostolic leaders especially need to form a new mental map to help the organization move forward in a meaningful and integral way.

Make no mistake, this is challenging work, and we mostly choose to avoid it in the hope that more of the same will deliver different results.

However, if we are to change and become more like Jesus intended in the first place, we will have to find a way to deal with the muscle memory, habits, ruts, and defaults that now entrap us. "Escaping" from these snares is critical if we are to find new forms and ways of doing things. This can be achieved through healthy practices and the creation of new habits and appropriate tools. (This will be more comprehensively explored in chapter nine on Practices.) But what is unlocked at this stage of the journey will be critical in the process of "discipling the organization" that comes into full operation in the upcurve stage of the Metanoic Journey. Our discoveries here will also inform the organizational DNA, which will in turn enable the development of the platform and the practices essential for metanoia to be embodied, whether individually or collectively.

In this Unlock stage, we will also need to start exploring new frontiers, comparing notes with other agencies facing similar challenges, and cultivating a culture open to learning new ways. This will also involve prayer-filled exploration and the spiritual receptivity that is characteristic of children in the mode of approach play.13

> [We] begin to understand why the Christian Bible insists on believers becoming like children … Children do not act as if their mental map is the final word on reality. Adults, on the other hand, choose to live as if their mental map is the final word on reality. We need to approach the world with a certain playfulness as children do.14

Use childlike imagination to explore alternative ways of doing things.

You need to think like a beginner rather than an expert. Deliberately put yourself out of your comfort zone. Think like a hacker—try to figure out the frailties in the system and crack the code. Learn from opposites, from people with a different outlook and culture. Look at how other disciplines have gone about resolving wicked problems. Sometimes the answer comes from entirely out of left field—such as Alexander Fleming’s accidental discovery of penicillin.

- At the Unlock stage, the key questions to explore might be:
   What are some of the bad habits, or behavioral ruts, we always
  seem to fall into? How do these bind us to outdated thinking and
   What other organizations are facing similar challenges? How can
  them?
  instance, worship is a core function of the church. To worship
  other than communal singing?
  And if not, what would we change?
  can we deliberately and regularly step out of our comfort zones,

## Understand

Here, towards the bottom of the downcurve, we should have gained sufficient (collective) self-awareness—through assessing the flaws in our system and by exploring possible solutions to the wicked problem—to be able to name some viable alternatives to our inherited ways of thinking and acting. Although we won’t yet have formulated a coherent mental map that fully interprets our situation, we ought to be aware of some of the broad frameworks of a new paradigm, and sense the promise of movement, along with some pointers to viable ways forward.

For instance, in the MLC Movement Lab, as participants enter the Understand phase, they will seek to gain a better comprehension of the broader characteristics of a distinctly movemental form of organization.

This clearer mental picture of movement provides a point of comparison to the inherited paradigm upon which most churches are currently founded. Having access to a viable and promising alternative vision of the church-as-movement in turn guides the selection of the core DNA, as well as the development of the platform and practices in the relearning side of the process. As a counterpoint to the standard ways of organizing, we learn that movements …

- have a dynamic world-changing vision and "can-do" culture;
- are built on communitas (comrades on a significant journey) as opposed to transactional relationships;
- are DNA-based organizations;
- are structured more as a decentralized network than a centralized hierarchy;
- are more like starfish than spiders—each part can reproduce the whole;
- are inherently adaptive because they are designed to move;
- spread like viruses.

A cursory comparison with the overwhelmingly non-movemental, more institutional forms of organization will quickly highlight areas of needed change. This understanding helps participants see how to resolve the wicked problem and so get to the next level.

At this stage, participants should also be able to identify the possible meta-ideas latent in the system that are waiting to be activated. The elements of mDNA are understood as the primary meta-ideas, but there are others that will become increasingly clear to the participants and the team.16 Clarity here is essential because these meta-ideas will form the organization's DNA, which will eventually be replicated in its culture, tools, and practices.

At the Understand stage, the key questions to explore might be:
   After extensive research, which organizations have we found that
  seem to have resolved their wicked problems? How can we engage
   Can we articulate what a movement is, and how it might compare
  organization compare?
   What are some specific thoughts and actions in the current
  organizational paradigm that either aid or hinder our organi-

## The Turning Point (The Moment of Insight)

Here we arrive at the bottom of the U-shaped curve that is the Metanoia Journey. By this point, we have engaged with a huge amount of un/learning; we have become aware of the frailties in our current way of doing things; we have sought to examine our systems to see what hinders and what helps in terms of achieving our preferred future; and we have also looked at alternative ways of fulfilling our unique calling.

This is the point of nakedness and openness to God, but this is precisely the place where God can impact us in a new way. The bottom of the curve is powerful because it is where God meets us … in the valley. Like Israel in the desert for forty years or Jesus' passion on the cross before the resurrection, this is that point in the hero's journey—the abyss—where insight into how to resolve the wicked problem is finally given.

This is the turning point.

> After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force … The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. The change is in accord with the time; therefore no harm results.17

Much has already been said about the power of insight gained through metanoia, but in terms of the Metanoia Journey, this is experienced as a moment of revelation—a breakthrough that comes in such a way that it cannot be unseen. With regard to our organization's core identity and purpose, this is the moment of revelation, and where we receive the elegant solution that makes complete sense. This is what we call "rectitude" or "fittingness"—the intuition that "this just feels so right" that you know it is from God. Archibald Wheeler extols the discovery of an elegant solution:

> To my mind there must be, at the bottom of it all, not an equation, but an utterly simple idea. And to me that idea, when we finally discover it, will be so compelling, so inevitable, that we will say to one another, "Oh, how beautiful. How could it have been otherwise?"18

This metanoic moment ought to be experienced for what it is: a conversion, something that involves the whole heart and not simply one dimension of our being. This is where you recognize that ancient archetypal template of the church that is latent in the core of the faith, and it begins to express itself through you. You should make every effort to attune yourselves to this moment, for it is the culmination of the passionate search that has been underway in the un/learning dimension of the journey. If you look at something long enough, it will reveal itself to you. Metanoia really does work this way.

For us, as authors, as well as for the organizations that we are directly part of (MLC, New Thing, Forge, City Leaders Collective, Redeemer City to City, For Charlotte Network), the elegant solution presents itself in the form of church-as-movement—in terms of its identity, nature, purpose, and practices. This understanding is based on the movemental expressions of church in the New Testament, as well as those that have occurred as defining moments throughout history—the Celtic movement, the early Franciscans, and the missionary orders (for example, the Jesuits, Franciscans, the early Methodists).

Depending on the nature and purpose of your organization, the elegant solution might be somewhat different. But we suggest that if you see yourselves as a functioning expression of the kingdom of God, united to Christ and his mission, then movemental characteristics will be somewhat present because it is the paradigm that is most consistent with Jesus' vision and God's mission in the world. It is, we believe, the truly instinctive form of church.

## The Journey Up (Inventing a New Future)

Because the next few chapters will explore the Metanoia Journey in more detail, we now wish to simply point out that the reconstructive design process that follows builds on the significant un/learning gained through the downcurve process. As we have noted time and again, it is absolutely critical to undergo this disassembling/unlearning phase and to become conscious of the system itself if we are to have any hope of guiding the organization to more hopeful and fruitful outcomes.

The main purpose for the upcurve, on the other hand, is to design a viable, integrated, organizational model and then to ensure that this is properly integrated in every aspect of the system going forward. This involves formulating a paradigm that characterizes it, building a platform consisting of culture and structures, and developing practices that embody the organizing—the process by which various ideas, values, and practices are fractalized throughout the organization.

  The upcurve therefore is about repurposing or, as we like to say,

  discipling the organization. And this is a critical process because failure
  least resistance every time, regardless of how much painful unlearning
  the old ones, the organization will return to inherited ruts and routines.

I nstitutional “muscle memory” pulls the organization back to the old and outworn modes of engagement. Attempts to change often fail because the organization hasn’t been restructured in a way that is more consistent with the paradigm shift that has occurred. There can be no avoiding this renovation if we are to successfully solve the wicked problem and gain the prize that awaits at the end of the process. And because this process is so involved, we are dedicating the next three chapters to the three stages of the reconstruction upcurve of the Metanoia Journey. For now, here is a brief overview of each of these stages.

   Paradigm: Expressed in the form of a consciously articulated mental

  It is important at this point to explicitly note how the design process itself
  (Paradigm   Platform   Practices) relates to how movements establish
  and grow. In the diagram <!-- Page 115 -->, note the exponential "movement

  It is important to note here that each sequential phase of the process

  (Paradigm   Platform   Practices) is critical to the viability of the next

  platform will likewise undermine viability later on; failure to create acces-

  As someone who has given their entire adult life to advancing what has

  been called “the missional movement”, I (Alan) hate to admit that—apart
  end, really “changed the game” of the Western church. Many leaders now

  (How could you not agree with Barth, Newbigin, Bosch, Guder, et al. on

  a great paradigm that people bought into but that failed to produce the
  great forest of a movement.
  This challenge remains open-ended, and the task remains unfulfilled.

And this is why we need to take charge in architecting the organizations we lead toward mature Jesus movements that will change the world because of the gospel of King Jesus that is at the heart of them.
