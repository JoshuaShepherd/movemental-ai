  It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.
  It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.

  For years, I (Rob) have framed my own teaching, preaching, and church/
  network consulting around what I referred to as “my three conversions.”
  I used the word “conversion” because I didn’t know of a better term to
  unsee moments that occur at critical points in life, where a barrier is
  that what I had previously referred to as a conversion is more accurately

  My first conversion (or metanoia) centered on the theology of
  union with Christ. This specific doctrine was a game-changer for me.

I have always found it helpful to state the obvious, so allow me to articulate this most beautiful of truths: Although we may have never met, all of us who believe in Jesus will spend forever together, perfectly united to God and each other, in the person of Christ Jesus. This is very good news!

  My second conversion was to the city. In 2007, the human
  population crossed a remarkable threshold. For the first time in
  history, the world became majority urban.1 Cities are the centers of
  our mission. If the church can reach cities, we have the opportunity

  I’m buying.”
  My third conversion centered on the concept of platform—the ideas

  and principles that show how decentralized, networked organizations

  I raise these personal metanoic experiences because they signi-
  ficantly shaped my life and ministry. They caused me to focus my
  calling on creating new paradigms that allow the church of the city

  you lead.

## PARADIGM

## Beginning the Upward Journey

As discussed in previous chapters, a fully orbed biblical understanding of metanoia ushers in a new way of thinking, a new way of seeing and engaging with the world—a paradigm shift. For it is only by looking deeply within our own paradigms that we can make the needed changes that allow us to unleash our full kingdom potential.

And even though this Metanoia Journey is one we choose to embark on, this work of shifting paradigms is far from easy, as experienced through the downward journey. As depicted in the U-curve diagram in the previous chapter, the Metanoia Journey is not simply climbing a mountain. It is far more akin to doing the rim-to-rim hike through the Grand Canyon. Think of the order—first going down, and then climbing. Those activities affect the body in different ways. Downhills are jarring. They pound the joints and ligaments and require keen awareness to avoid a fall. The uphill climb burns. The big muscles swell, the back aches, and extra endurance is required to make it to the top. Both directions involve pain, but knowing which pain comes at which stage is important. Whereas the journey down is full of unknowns and questions (Can I really do this? How long will it take?), the upward journey is full of hope. It is about building, creating, and charting a new way forward. But in this chapter we find ourselves at the bottom of the U-curve. We have reached the metaphorical Colorado River that carved out the Grand Canyon. It is here where we can stop and celebrate the progress we have made on our Metanoic Journey. At this point, having crossed the halfway mark, we can begin the upward journey with new confidence. From here on, endurance will be key.

We will feel new muscles, and in short order they’ll begin to burn— but take heart! When we experience these sensations, we’re well on the way to an unimaginable vista.

  As seen in the diagram on the following page, we begin the upcurve
  journey by articulating our internal organizational paradigm. This, as we
  will see, acts as the mind of the organization, with all its key DNA, mental
  zational platform and practices, addressed in the coming chapters, that

## Once Upon a Paradigm

Aparadigm is a way of perceiving and making sense of the complex world in which we live. Once established, paradigms in many ways do our thinking for us; that is their purpose.3 Paradigms are largely shared realities—social constructs.4 They are essentially the beliefs you share with those around you, such as your friends and family. These ideas, concepts, and beliefs that you and others have in common about religion, nationality, and other aspects of culture form a significant part of your individual and collective identities, but how often do you consider where they came from or how they might change? For example, you’ve no doubt heard the phrase “the American way.” This is a paradigm because it refers to a collection of beliefs and ideas about what it means to be American, namely a pronounced individualistic and pragmatic way of life that

## PARADIGM

adheres to the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.5 For those who hold this paradigm, it will likely serve as the foundation of how they view or interact with the world around them. This example emphasizes one of the most important purposes of a paradigm, which is that it comprises beliefs and ideas that form a framework or a lens through which we approach and engage with other things or people.

## Paradigm Blindness

However necessary paradigms are, everyone is subject to the limitations and distortions produced by their socially conditioned nature. Unless we undergo a disruptive event, or the deconstructive experience of the downcurve as described in the last chapter, the paradigm will remain largely unconscious and therefore unarticulated. Most of us generally assume that our paradigm is correct without ever having thought about it. In relation to organizations, a paradigm functions as the effective mind of the organization, controlling thinking and behavior without us being aware of how or why this might be the case. This is why the downcurve of the metanoia process is so vital and must not be bypassed. If we are to experience genuine metanoia, we must work to become conscious of the system itself, including its frailties and blind spots—what we called “anomalies” in the previous chapter.

  You likely know the saying, “We don’t know who discovered water,
  but it wasn’t the fish.” The fish simply swim in the water and take for
  granted that it is part of their reality. So, too, when we are fully immersed

  churches and organizations have inherited certain ways of doing things,
  we might have a sneaking suspicion there is a better way.
  Although paradigms are essential and enable us to meaningfully

  negotiate the world, they can also create what is called “paradigm

  consider the well-known image (shown below) that, depending on how
  tend to see one at the exclusion of the other, even though both are there.

We simultaneously see and are blinded.

  This highlights just how important metanoia is in the equation of change.

The steps of the downcurve of the Metanoia Journey (Unravel, Uncover, Unlock, Understand) reveal not only the fragilities in the prevailing system but also uncover the possibilities lying dormant in the threat. It is this point, at the moment in the curve when the fragilities and possibilities collide, that a “Eureka!” moment occurs. From there, we can actively design and construct a viable and meaningful mental map that will guide the organization toward achieving its greatly desired prize. We believe that this is the moment when organizations conceive of becoming a movement.

  Paradigm as the “Seed of Metanoia”

As we begin the upcurve of the Metanoia Journey, we will examine the three distinct yet interconnected elements of an organizational paradigm, which we call the “the seed of metanoia.” They are:

   paradigm as organizational mind;

## PARADIGM

   the associated mental maps that orient the organization in the
   organizational genetics (something akin to DNA) that encode the

  Because of how paradigm influences the genetics of the organization, we
  can think of no better illustration to show how these three key elements
  work together than the seed, shown below.

## The Seed of Metanoia

  Paradigm as Organizational Mind

Just as the apostle Paul commends the church to be transformed through the renewing of our minds (Romans 12:2), here we explore what it looks like to renew our organizational mind. To understand the organizational mind, we must examine the second part of the word metanoia (–noia), which, as we previously noted, is derived from the Greek word nous, meaning “mind.” In the New Testament, this refers to a person or society’s outlook or mindset.

Just as your mind guides your choices and the way you see the world, your organizational mind serves as a guiding framework for the organization.

  In order to change our mind, we need to become more aware of
  the nature of paradigms themselves—how they work and how they can
  change. In exploring corporate change, consider these elements of the

Primary/Controlling Metaphors of Identity. The organizational mind reveals how we describe ourselves as a spiritual community, such as “the body of Christ,” “church as organism,” “the family of God,” “network,” “parachurch,” or “mission agency.” We might also use metaphors that describe our design or model for mission, such as a starfish (as opposed to a spider), a seed (which contains the potential for the whole forest), or a spark (which contains the potential for a forest fire).

  The Heroic Story. The organizational mind is shaped by what and
  who the organization values. This is often revealed in the primary
  stories or origin stories that are central to their identity, such as what
  the perseverance of the leaders, which allowed it to survive until
  various transformative Jesus-movements throughout history. From
  the Methodist Movement to the Great Welsh Revival to the Back to
  amazing stories of men and women obediently pursuing God’s mission

  The Defining Idea. The defining idea acts as the core driver of the
  organization. For instance, the defining idea of MLC is that of an apostolic
  movement, as opposed to the less dynamic and more centralized ideas of

  Sense of Meaning. Most organizations have a sense of unique identity,
  purpose, and direction. Keeping with the example listed above, the core
  sense of meaning at the heart of MLC as an apostolic movement is the
  sent Jesus, Jesus has sent us (John 20:21), it allows us to see how we fit into

  All these come together to form the collective mind of the organi-
  zation and its innate, ultimate sense of purpose (telos). They function
  as a worldview—a way of viewing reality for the community that shares

## PARADIGM

held, even if it has not been fully considered. The mental map is often assumed to be legitimate until some event disrupts it and exposes its frailties and flaws. Consider, for instance, the assumptions on which most churches in the West operate—a Christendom paradigm in which the church is the primary or exclusive religion in culture and, as a result, churches operate almost completely in attractional mode. With this mindset, the expectation is that if the church offers services (whatever they might be), people will automatically come to the church (building) in order to find God. As a result, there is little understanding or practice of “sentness” in the standard Western church. Yet, when reading the Bible, it seems clear that having a unique outward-focused mission was an essential dimension of the early church’s understanding and practice.

  By this stage of the metanoia curve, the paradigm will have come out
  of the shadows of our collective unconscious and will be more concrete.

We are now aware of its presence in both defining who we are (identity) and calling us forward to our unique purpose (mission). We will also be aware of the flaws of the prevailing paradigm and will begin to address them throughout the rest of the upcurve journey.

  With this understanding of paradigms in mind, leaders must take respon-
  sibility for constructing the mental map that will guide the organization going
  forward. This process of creating a mental map is far more important than
  the mind of Christ fully active and engaged. The mental map must appeal to

Redesigning a viable mental map requires a thorough theological audit to move us from our largely uncritical acceptance of consciously held beliefs to more explicit belief statements. Such beliefs have a significant impact on the culture of the organization, an aspect we will explore more deeply in the next chapter.

  Conscious Competencies. Awell-formed mental map will require
  the organization and its members to move from unconscious incompe-

  One of the greatest benefits of a well-designed, conscious mental map is

  that it helps create a clear and compelling vision for where we are going.

After all, this is the point of a map! For instance, our vision for MLC is to “shift the tracks of history” by helping authentic movements to scale.

The mental map created by the combination of all the above points guides everything we do.

  Recognizing the key issues in our current paradigm will help us

Although the church in the last few decades has finally become more aware of this legacy, this implicit paradigm is still very much alive throughout the contemporary church.

  Paradigm as Organizational Genetics (Elements of DNA)

In many ways, paradigms operate in a similar way to genetics in an organic system, thus we suggest the metaphor of organizational genetics. The DNA dictates both the uniformity as well as the uniqueness of the organism. For instance, if you’re reading this, it’s pretty likely you’re a human, a member of a group of billions of other organisms called homo sapiens. But even though there are multiple billions of humans, you are an utterly unique expression of this group, with your own distinct characteristics and identity. The Encyclopedia Britannica defines DNA as an “organic chemical of complex molecular structure that is found in all organic, living, cells.”10 We can also say that DNA:

   codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits;
   is self-replicating;

   carries vital information for healthy reproduction; and
   when it mutates, affects the integrity of the whole system.

  Functioning like organic DNA, organizational DNA is composed of the
  elements that make up the organizational mind (primary metaphors of
  identity, the heroic story, the defining idea, and the sense of meaning)
  determinative “genetics” of the organization. Each element of DNA ought

## If IHad a Lever Long Enough

As a recap, a meta-idea is essentially an idea that determines and organizes other ideas. Think of it as a foundational idea that provides a platform on which to build a working theory or an organizing principle; or as a cornerstone concept around which other ideas are formed. Ameta-idea is therefore not a “mere” idea among others; it is a doorway to the thinking of the organization. It is a primary idea that organizes other secondary ideas.11 Meta-ideas provide a way of seeing better and working smarter because they help us make sense of lots of confusing experiences and seemingly isolated facts. As such, meta-ideas are critical in creating the right culture and behaviors in the organization.

  Theology is loaded with meta-ideas. Consider, for example, the
  doctrine of the Trinity, or of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resur-
  rection of Jesus. We know all too well that when someone seeks to distort
  across our entire theological system and, as a result, for our culture and

  Meta-ideas are not simply doctrinal; they have huge, practical impli-
  cations. Take discipleship, for instance. To test whether discipleship is
  simply a good idea or a meta-idea, ask yourself, What problem in the

  disciple-making means to fail everywhere. Right now, our assessment

  Another way of seeing the importance of meta-ideas is to see them
  as levers for system-wide change. It was Archimedes, who once stated
  that if he had a lever long enough, and a fulcrum on which to place it, he

## Name the Baby

Following the clues from living systems, and from what you have learned along the Metanoia Journey, you are now ready to identify and name the core DNA of your organization.

  Once you have identified the meta-ideas that have high leverage
  in your organization and that are consistent with the organizational
  mind and mental model, naming DNA is relatively simple. It will

## PARADIGM

again, let’s use discipleship as an example. A DNA statement might well be expressed as follows: “We are committed to discipleship in all that we do, to ensure that every believer is involved in an observable process of becoming increasingly like Jesus.” It is important that this not simply be a statement of intellectual belief but instead one that requires observable and measurable action. Another example of DNA might be a commitment to incarnational forms of ministry and mission. This can be measured in a consistent culture and practices that can be seen in the life of the community—for example, how the church contextualizes the gospel or its physical proximity to those the church is trying to reach.

  The process of developing explicit DNA statements that encode the
  organizational paradigm must be a prayerful exercise, which takes place
  over time and with your core leadership team.

## Fractalize It Y’all

To best understand how DNA scales, we must understand the fractal nature of movemental organizations. Afractal is an irregular or fragmented geometric shape that can be repeatedly subdivided into parts, each of which is a smaller copy of the whole. In other words, it’s a pattern that recurs at every scale. Fractals can be found everywhere in the natural world. In trees, for example, the limbs, branches, and leaves reproduce in the exact same pattern. DNA is a powerful fractal in your body as well—it is in every one of your thirty-two trillion cells! You can also see fractals in snowflakes, lightning and electricity, plants, flowers, seashells, clouds, crystals, and in the circulatory systems of mammals.

In other words, fractals represent how God designed the created order to scale.

  In the diagram on the following page, the basic fractal is that of the
  simple triangle. This pattern in turn forms the foundational structure of
  the more complex patterns that build on it, while maintaining the core

The fact that the fractal recurs at every scale of the organization is crucial, because it means the idea will inevitably occur throughout. Thus, when DNA arises from deep within the paradigm, takes shape in the platform, and is infused into all the tools and practices of the organization, it will achieve scale. We will examine this in more depth in the next two chapters.

  From Paradigm Set to Paradigm Shift

Now that we have examined the nature and power of paradigms and how they control the organization, we will move on to what must be in place to shift your organizational paradigm—to “blow your (organizational) mind.” As you begin this upward journey, remember the following:

## PARADIGM

  Essentials for Shifting Paradigms
  Several essential elements must be present if your organization is to experience paradigm shift (metanoia) and become a movement-ready organization.

- Shifting Paradigms Requires Leadership Unity

It might seem obvious, but a disunified leadership team cannot unite a church or organization around a new paradigm. It is important to remember that shifting paradigms is an important part of organizational discipleship. This requires all the organization’s leadership to be involved and on the same page. Below are a couple of common barriers to leadership unity that stifle paradigm shift:

  Staff/Board Division. In our work with churches and ministries, one
  of the biggest barriers to metanoia we encounter is the divide between
  senior level staff (pastors/directors) and their board/elders. Sadly, in most
  tional discipleship includes senior leaders bringing their boards along in
  structures.
  Leadership I nsecurity. Many senior leaders are afraid of shifting

  paradigms because of identity issues. They think when subordinates point
  on them or, in some cases, is a direct attack on their leadership. This fear
  senior leaders open themselves to this process and address paradigm
  typically turns out well for them personally, in the following ways:
   Other staff and leaders respect the senior leader more for
  addressing organizational issues head on.
  help solve organizational problems, causing them to be more
   As a senior leader wrestles with areas of dysfunction and

  personal and professional growth that will bear fruit for them

We must not let leadership insecurity get in the way of the change that is needed. Too much is riding on it!

  Shifting Paradigms Requires Apostolic Imagination

One of my (Alan) favorite sayings is that, as organizations, we are perfectly designed to produce what we are currently producing. In other words, most of the problems we face are because of the choices we (or others before us) have made that need to be corrected if we are to see change. This is clearly evident in the church as most of us know it, which has been formulated and primarily led by pastors and teachers, and thus is perfectly designed to produce pastoral and didactic outcomes. The problem of course is that the church is meant to be more than that. One of the biggest design faults in the church is that it lacks apostolic imagination and focus—the very thing the New Testament church had in abundance.

So what do we mean by “apostolic” imagination? Technically, apostolic refers to the “sentness” of the church. The apostles were the ones sent by Jesus—the ones willing to take risks and innovate to create new structures and organizations.12

  Most leadership within the Western context is dominated by left-
  brain thinking, focusing on logic, analytics, methodologies, and the
  like, all of which can be extremely positive. But left-brain thinking can
  must activate our collective right brain—the seat of creativity, intuition,
  instead, just as we are to become wholehearted organizations as examined
  the creative gifts God has given us. We worship a creative God, who has
  within our organizations and within our culture, it will require operating
  nation within us. Imagination is soaked in possibility; it can see around

  Unleashing apostolic imagination will require church leaders to be
  willing to take risks. As we mentioned in an earlier chapter, we must
  abandon the concept of “failure is not an option.” Failure is not failure

## PARADIGM

when you learn from it. Failure is simply “validated learning.” And in this time of extreme liminality, if we cannot shift our paradigms, we should not be surprised when our churches and organizations die. This process of activating apostolic imagination is a way to foster joy and new life within your organization’s leadership team—and the church as a whole needs joy now more than ever!

- Shifting Paradigms Requires Perseverance
  Perseverance is needed in shifting your organizational paradigm because:

  Shifting Paradigms is Hard. Genuine paradigm transformation
  requires getting to the deepest parts of the organization. This is almost
  always a hard, painful process. In his book, Systems Thinking for Social
  though the majority of the issues lie under the surface, most leaders prefer

  describe the process as a cold, dark, and lonely endeavor, in which it is

  Shifting Paradigms is I ncremental. There are no shortcuts on the
  journey of metanoia. No silver bullets. It takes time and patience. To see
  the change you hope for, you must play the long game—which is why we

  But take heart. Some of God’s greatest work in conforming us
  into the likeness of Jesus, both personally and organizationally, comes
  through perseverance. We know this both experientially and through the
  character, hope, and maturity (Romans 5:3–5; James 1:2–4).
  Shifting Paradigms Requires Telling an Alternate Story

  The late Austrian philosopher, I van I llich, was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change society. He responded by saying,
  Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society,

  rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps

  that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent
  take the next step forward. If you want to change a society, then you

  I llich is right; the only way to upend an existing powerful story is with a
  paradigm that dominates our current approach to leadership and church,
  and better story, a story that is unapologetically laser-focused on the
  our lives, organizations, and society. We must not allow our stories to
  reductionism or false dichotomies, such as us/them, left/right, God/

  Once we write a new and compelling story, one that sets the hearts of
  God’s people on fire, we must allow it to reframe us and seep into every
  part of our culture, systems, and practices. It is only through the reframing
  change, growth, and impact we desire. And unless the paradigm at the
  must come from deep inside the paradigm (the bottom of the iceberg!).

Anything less will simply be surface level.15

- Shifting Paradigms Requires Letting Things Die

In part one of this book, we addressed the reality that if you fall in love with your system, you lose the capacity to change it. This love of the system can be tantamount to idolatry. People are formed by the things they love, which is why idolatry is so dangerous. It is misplaced love, and it blinds people to the only Person worthy of our affections. Perhaps the clearest picture of how idols affect us is the golden calf narrative in Exodus 32.

When Moses came back down the mountain and saw the idol the people had created, he destroyed the golden calf, ground it into dust, and forced the Israelites to drink it. They literally consumed their idol. It became part of them. And from that point on in the story, the Israelites are often referred to as having the qualities of their idol. Just like the golden calf, they had eyes but could not see. They had ears but could not hear. They were hard-hearted and a stiff-necked (stubborn) people.

## PARADIGM

  The church might be the chief of sinners when it comes to holding
  on to systems, paradigms, traditions, programs, and thinking that need
  to die. This process of letting things die is far from easy, but it is essential

  Shifting Paradigms Requires Seeing Reality for What It Is
  The last element that must be in place to shift paradigms is the ability to
  see reality for what it is. Well-known businessman Max De Pree noted that
  that Jesus is the One who decisively shapes the movement that claims his
  parameters of how people think about his church. Allowing Jesus to guide
  in the world. In other words, it’s the job of leaders to define ecclesia for the

This leads to seeing what they want to see rather than what actually is.

  Confirmation Bias. Confirmation bias is incredibly common within
  our culture, especially in the church.19 This is the tendency of leaders to
  interpret reality in such a way as to confirm their beliefs or paradigms.

People display this bias when they favor information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. Its effect is particularly potent among those who desire certain predetermined outcomes, in emotionally charged issues, and for those with deeply entrenched beliefs.

It can also be seen in how leadership teams are formed—when senior leaders surround themselves with yes-people and sycophants rather than a team that allows for diverse types of thinking to thrive.

  All Answers, No Questions. Leaders are expected to have all the answers
  people are looking for. Unfortunately, trying to be the source of all knowledge
  is both exhausting and can significantly hinder your pursuit of the unknown.

Defining reality requires leaders to approach the task of shifting paradigms by having many more questions than answers—not resting on your past knowledge but fervently seeking to be attentive to the present and what is unknown. American philosopher and rabbi Abraham Heschel argues that people are kept from seeing reality because what they know is always getting in the way of what they don’t know. He states, “The principle to be kept in mind is to know what we see rather than to see what we know.”20 He goes on to teach about the importance of being able to truly think and see things in the present. This ability is the basis of true insight … metanoia.

  Becoming an Open-Minded Organization

As we seek to be transformed through the renewing of our minds, we close this chapter asking, What does it mean to be an open-minded organization? Through extensive experiments in the field of personality psychology, it has been shown that open-minded people process

## PARADIGM

information in different ways and may literally see the world differently from others. Open-minded people are more inclusive in their thinking and more expansive in how they process information. They tend to be intellectually curious, creative, and imaginative. They are interested in art and are voracious consumers of music, books, and other fruits of culture. According to personality theorists, this level of openness reflects a greater “breadth, depth, and permeability of consciousness” and propensity to “cognitively explore” both abstract information (ideas and arguments) and sensory information (sights and sounds). In other words, open-minded people are able to see and understand things that close-minded people can’t.21 The same is true for open-minded organizations. Becoming an open-minded organization is at the heart of metanoia. As explored in earlier chapters, our minds are in constant need of recalibration to the mind of Christ. As we look at the state of the contemporary paradigm of the church, we see that we have quite a challenge before us.

  That said, changing the course of history will not require every
  Christian leader and organization to shift paradigms all at once. That
  simply isn’t the way mass change works. In a standard bell curve of the
  innovators.22 When they embrace a new paradigm—a new way of seeing
  adopters make up the next 13.5 percent of the whole. When they embrace
  will pay attention.
  The question every leader and organization must wrestle with is what

  group they will be in. Will they be part of the 2.5 percent that are willing
  wholehearted leaders and organizations for the sake of the future of the
  comes after them? If you are part of the 2.5 percent, you are ready to
  you lead can begin to embody your new paradigm.
