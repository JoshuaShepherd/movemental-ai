  When the 2010 movie I nception was released, it became something
  of a cultural phenomenon with surprising staying power. At the center of
  this mind-bending story is Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo Di Caprio), a

However, instead of being hired to steal someone’s thoughts, the protagonist is hired to implant a thought deep within the subconscious mind of a CEO, a process called inception. Through this inception technology, Cobb and his team enter into the dream world of their target, journeying so deeply into the subconscious that they are able to change the CEO’s mind. And all this is achieved through architecture! Within this dream

world, the architect has the power to create completely new realities, guided by systems and structures that change how all those who participate in them operate. For instance, while in this dream world, the city’s streets and buildings look, move, and function in new and extraordinary ways, where the laws of gravity seem to be mere suggestions. But even in this dream world, the architect cannot change someone’s mind for them. Rather, they architect the settings, surroundings, scenarios, and characters so purposefully that the idea simply “occurs” to the target.

When the dreamer wakes, it is their idea—they know just what to do.

And if the architect has done their job well, the subject will never know the architect was even there!1

  This is similar to the way platforms work. As leaders, our role is not
  to change the mind of the people we lead by force, but to create platforms
  that architect the organizational culture and structures so purposefully

Because these platforms so clearly align with the paradigm itself, the practical implications become obvious.

## Platformed

In the previous chapter, I (Rob) referenced the first two metanoias that dramatically shaped my life and ministry—a conversion to “union with Christ” and a conversion to “the city.” Working in, for, and with churches for more than two decades—and seeing and experiencing the brokenness of the system of the church—led to my third conversion: to the concept of platform.

  Today, many use the word “platform” to describe either a technology
  (such as Airbnb, Uber, or Facebook), or someone’s own personal platform
  (their public persona). However, the way we use the term refers specifi-
  the basis for its various practices and rhythms—in a similar way to how
  the various apps function. This platform infrastructure is made up of two
  culture. The power of culture and structures cannot be underestimated.

They impact how everyone experiences and moves within the organization.2 For those that prefer formulas, here’s a simple way to illustrate this:

  Platform = Culture + Structures
  Think of platform as one of the key components of movemental organi-

  zation that must be in place for the church/organization to both move

  embodies the hard-won paradigm, where concepts are experienced more
  might have a great paradigm, but it will fail to have any real impact. It will

  The table below shows the key components of platform that we will
  review in this chapter. To facilitate a truly movemental infrastructure,
  both culture and structures must be fully architected and implemented.

## Platform Alignment

To understand how the different aspects of the organizational platform work together, consider a piece of furniture most of us have in our homes: a table. Atable is a physical structure that has a purpose. It can bring people together; it can be a surface on which to place your coffee or food; or it can be a place on which to work, and so forth. Thus, a table is a structure (a literal, physical platform) on which people can perform certain functions. But that’s not all there is to say about tables. The type of table (coffee table, dining room table, conference table, school

## PLATFORMED

desk), what it’s made of (metal, plastic, wood), and the environment in which it exists (coffee shop, board room, office, kitchen) completely changes the working function—or the culture—of each particular table.

Placing a kitchen table in a conference room would feel incongruous.

But when a kitchen table is placed in a kitchen, or a conference table is placed in a conference room, both culture and structures are fully aligned. In the same way, healthy, movemental platforms are formed when culture and structures are aligned. But let’s be clear: In this illustration, the focus is not on the table but rather on what is happening around that table—whether a deep conversation over a shared meal, or a team accomplishing an important project, the point is on architecting the table properly, with its purpose in mind, in order to accomplish the desired outcomes.

  Unfortunately, in the majority of churches and organizations, a strong
  alignment between culture and structures is the exception rather than the
  rule. Often this is because leaders don’t see the two dimensions as being
  the platform work. To carry forward the table illustration, a misaligned
  small coffee shop or, even worse, using that table as a chair. It would be

  In the field of psychology, family systems theory has much to teach
  us about the importance of culture-structures alignment. In her book,
  Brain-Body Parenting, Mona Delahooke examines the connection
  them to be functioning in alignment for the child to be physically and
  the brain (similar to culture), controls how the child acts, the body
  child acting. I ronically, the term Delahooke gives to the interconnec-
  “platform”! When the platform connection between the body and brain

  the presence of these symptoms helps parents and health professionals

  Organizations work in exactly the same way. When the platform (the
  interconnectivity between culture and structures) is not aligned, the whole
  organization is out of sync with itself. This inevitably leads to extensive
  zation. And again, as with parenting, the evidence of the dysfunction

  When I (Rob) was a child, my mother would often say to me, “Your
  actions are speaking so loudly, I can’t hear a word you are saying.” (I
  may have had a slight rebellious streak.) Similarly, in most churches,

It turns out that the famous quote by philosopher Marshall Mc Luhan really is correct: that the medium (of attractional church or clericalism) really is the message!4 What we win people with is what we win them to. This misalignment between culture and structures creates inevitable frustration and doubt.5

## A Unique Opportunity

In addition to the concept of platform as we have just defined it (Culture + Structures), the notion of platform can also encapsulate a set of principles, rules, and processes for how platform-based organizations are governed.

These principles and processes, which are deeply rooted in network science and theory, look very different from traditional, hierarchical, and institutional organizational operating systems and structures. Platform principles and practices have been proven to lead to far greater scale than traditional operating systems. These principles have been nearly perfected with the advent of the internet and global technology platforms, such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google—and have led to what many call the “platform revolution.”6

  But here is the beautiful thing about these platform principles. The
  more we study and understand the design principles that undergird
  them—which we will be doing later in this chapter—the more we

## PLATFORMED

realize they reflect how our Lord Jesus intended the church to operate in the first place. This presents the church with a unique opportunity.

If churches and organizations can effectively architect and implement a new platform based on these principles, we have the opportunity to “double align” our organizations with reality. First, to align our organizations with Jesus’ original design and ongoing intent for the church; and second, to come into alignment with the broader cultural platform revolution that is happening in our day—thus, developing a kingdom equivalent to the movie I nception. New churches and organizations will be more aligned to Jesus, while simultaneously aligning with a redeemed version of our cultural reality. Bring on this inception!

  Having established that our platforms are the movemental infras-
  tructure of our churches and organizations—and that we not only form
  them, but they ultimately form us—the remainder of the chapter will

  Culture: The Soul of the Organization

Just as the paradigm operates as the “mind” of the organization, the platform—and more specifically, the culture—is the functional “soul” of the organization. When you think of someone’s soul, you think of their true self, their essence or ethos. The culture of your organization acts in exactly the same way. It embodies what is most true about the organization. Getting your culture right, therefore, cannot be left to chance.

  As we noted earlier, Peter Drucker once famously quipped,
  “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” Was Drucker saying that strategy is
  unimportant? Certainly not. He was just saying that getting the culture of
  good your strategy is, if the culture is unhealthy, strategy won’t make a

Unfortunately, toxic culture is all too often the norm, and maintaining a healthy culture is extremely difficult.

  Ahealthy culture should begin to explicitly (and implicitly) bring to
  light what we truly value. In other words, we have to name the values that
  are important, make them concrete, and develop a living culture that will

  Below are the six key aspects of organizational culture, each of which is essential to discipling the organization:
  I dentify and Develop Theological Distinctives

  As churches and organizations, we have all been given the gift and
  creeds of the church, which should be nurtured and consciously rehearsed.

However, as churches and organizations, we will all have core theological distinctives. Therefore, to be a leader within Christ’s church requires us to be working theologians, helping people understand those theological distinctives. We are to share theology in a way that makes it contextually unique. This process of articulating explicit theological distinctives is directly tied to identifying our implicit beliefs (explored in the previous chapter).

  Theological distinctives should clearly communicate to those
  stepping into the church or organization what you hold most dear.

Members or participants should be able to read them and say, “Oh, that’s why they defined it that way.” We suggest forming only three to five theological distinctives, as too many can cause confusion. For instance, we have friends who have planted churches that frame their theology as Sacramental, Communal, Missional. These three words give their members and prospective members enough information to discern whether this is

## PLATFORMED

the right community for them. Theological distinctives might also reflect denominational background, such as charismatic, Spirit-filled, reformed, complementarian, egalitarian, and the like.

  When I (Rob) was forming the For Charlotte Network, we were aware
  that we were working with a diverse, citywide network of churches from
  across racial, denominational, and socioeconomic lines. Therefore, our
  the Centrality of Christ, the Unity of His Church, and the Flourishing of Our
  openly, but these three distinctives—which can be shortened to Christ,
  pastors that lead one of the many networks in the For Charlotte Network

## Formulate Core Values

In the process of creating culture, it is important to delineate between theological distinctives and values. Both are essential, but they are not synonymous.7 Values are often implicit, but through a process of dialogue in community, these are made explicit and then must be categorized according to their relative weight and significance. In other words, the difference between general values and core values should be clear. Core values get us all passionate and worked up. In this way, they are tied to the meta-ideas and DNA statements articulated in your paradigm. Core values translate the DNA into and through the organization. This is at the heart of the fractal organizing process addressed in the previous chapter. When fully adopted and embodied, core values ensure the DNA is embedded as the organization scales. Leaders must take great care to articulate core values, since they impact every aspect of the organization.

  As a best practice, we recommend creating six to eight core values.

Once we are clear about what we truly value, we can then deliberately reorder our thinking and choices around them. In such a way, values become guides to thinking—shaping attitudes and behaviors. Core values act like road lines, which help us keep our car in the appropriate lane or from veering off the road altogether. But road lines only do this if they are clear and well lit, and if the person in the driver’s seat is paying attention to them as a matter of course! So, take the time to craft value statements that capture the imagination. The best core values are typically a fun combination of honesty, creativity, stickiness, and most of all, are deeply personal and unique to the organization.

## Develop Shared Vocabulary

As we addressed in the previous chapter, words define reality. If you can shape the various conversations in the community, you can shape the culture. If you can change the language, you can significantly restructure the way people process information and communicate. The Bible is very clear about verbal integrity and avoiding the sins of the tongue (see James 3:1–12; Matthew 15:11, for example), so we must be careful that the development of our vocabulary is not manipulative. At the same time, we must recognize that it’s extremely important to shape the organizational discourse—to guide how members talk about church, mission, heroes, and so on. We suggest you define or redefine terms and create a commonly understood vocabulary consistent with the central paradigm of your church or organization. For example, because most people have a concrete perception of church, you might choose to use the word “movement” in place of the customary term “church” to describe who you are. If you start referring to your church as part of Jesus’ movement in the world, it reshapes the consciousness of those you are leading, and in so doing helps them act like the movement of Jesus they are meant to become.

## I dentify Heroes

“Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do” (Philippians 3:17). “Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith” (Hebrews 13:7). “And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets” (Hebrews 11:32). The Bible clearly demonstrates, both by example and commands, that we should identify those who are worth following, and then imitate them. When we consider this in light of culture-making, we need to ask, Who are the organization’s heroes? Who are the exemplars we wish to emulate? Can we name leaders, individuals, churches, and organizations who are doing things the way we want to

## PLATFORMED

do them? It’s not enough to imagine Jesus in your mind, indispensable though that is; we need to see him lived out concretely in the lives of others. That is how the collective culture is shaped.

  Our heroes ought to embody our values and live out what we all hope
  to become. In other words, show me your heroes, and I will show you
  who you are! Who an organization admires shows a lot about the type of
  is a brilliant scholar and preacher, everyone gets the message that it is
  hand, the hero is the church planter or pioneer, people get the message
  examples of what you are seeking to achieve.
  Don’t underestimate the importance of everyday heroes—they are

  embodiments of change, especially when empowered by the esteem of
  tions within an organization. For instance, if the senior leader is seen to

  Ask yourself, Who are the heroes of our organization—historically
  and currently? Are they the right heroes? Who should they be?

## Celebrate Positive Behavior

“When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, ‘I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel’” (Luke 7:9). “She has done a beautiful thing to me... Truly, I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her” (Mark 14:6, 9). Wow! Suffice it to say, Jesus celebrated positive behavior. This is not to say that negative behavior should go ignored. It’s just that we often forget to promote good behavior.

  Similar to the idea of identifying heroes, this means celebrating the
  actions of those who are living in a way that is consistent with the vision
  and culture of the church/organization—especially for those who are
  rally consistent behavior has a profound effect on culture building. For
  year after year with no fanfare. What statement would it make to the rest
  it look like for those who lead well to be, as the Scriptures say, considered
  some sort of elitism, and certainly not as a manipulation of people, but
  to those you are leading about what your church/organization values.

This in turn has a major impact on your culture.

  Individuals can be rewarded in multiple ways, but it can be particularly
  helpful to use rituals—regular and repeatable patterns and practices—in
  your gatherings. For example, affirm and commission members through
  guish those who deserve to be singled out so the recognition has real

Almost all successful platforms incorporate the concept of “gamification”—an embedded reward system that is central to their architecture.

From the “like” button on Facebook to the “retweet” on Twitter to gaining points/credits on whatever game you are addicted to on your smartphone, gamification is foundational to successful platform architecture, as it shapes the culture and motivations of its participants. Let us be quite clear, however: the rewards we seek to incorporate into organizational culture are not for the sake of a hit of social dopamine—lest they “receive their reward in full” (Matthew 6:2). This is not about controlling or manipulating the motivations of those in our organizations. It’s about leaders doing what is right for leaders to do. And it is right for leaders to celebrate positive behavior because such behavior significantly contributes to the culture we are seeking to create.

## Brand the Organization

Once we do the hard work of renewing the organizational mind/ paradigm internally, we are ready to brand the church or organization externally. We have to be careful when using this term, because advertisers and spin doctors profoundly manipulate branding. Nonetheless, it would be naive to think that managing the “brand” (how people perceive the movement) is irrelevant in creating a healthy missional culture in the church or organization. Because all organizations have a distinct identity through which they interact (even if it’s just their name), we must steward how we externally communicate our distinctives and values. Think of a brand as a promise kept. A good brand keeps its promises, and a bad one doesn’t—it disappoints. Your brand is your church or organization’s

## PLATFORMED

public identity, and how you project your identity to the world has significant consequences. In other words, branding has to do with being intentional with our words for those encountering our church or organization.

In many ways, the culture can automatically be incubated from within; but it would certainly not harm your cause to make sure the symbols, words, and ideas you project to the outside world are consistent with who you are and what you are about.

## Final Thoughts on Culture

When you mix theological distinctives, values, vocabulary, heroes, reward systems, and your brand together, you create a distinct ethos and culture— and culture is what people interact with. The culture in turn creates an atmosphere—the “vibe”—that those encountering the organization can feel in the ether of the community. Or, as stated earlier, the culture is like the “soul” of the organization. This organizational soul affects people. In the same way a magnetic field has an influence on various metals, the aura of your movement will impact people coming into it.

  For instance, a fast-food restaurant emits a different vibe (eat quickly,
  get out) than a fine steakhouse (stick around and work your way through
  the courses). Similarly, a megachurch in Southern California has a very
  in New England. Different leaders and organizations create different

  Aculture thus communicates (verbally and nonverbally) through
  symbols, actions, and experiences what we really think and what we
  truly value. An explicit, well-developed culture is crucial in determining
  resources, and setting the overall direction of the organization.
  In summary, then, among the ingredients for organizational culture

  formation, the following are most critical: 1) identify and develop theolo-
  values—what drives the organization; 3) develop a shared vocabulary—
  thing; 4) identify heroes—who to watch, pay attention to, whose examples
  well; and 6) brand the organization—how to summarize and talk about

  With these components of culture in place, we are ready to look at
  platform structures in depth. Although we are exploring the subjects
  separately, in practice we work on culture and structure at the same
  platform its movemental quality, while also keeping the proverbial bike
  gets its culture “right” is not the best approach. Good structures make
  correctives for one another when organizations work on them concur-

  Now that we have looked at culture, we turn to focus on the practical
  components of architecting movemental structures.

- Architecting Movemental Structures

“By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 3:10–11).

  Because Jesus’ kingdom operates differently from those of this world,
  the principles that govern architecting and building movemental churches
  and organizations differ from those of other organizations. Leaders should
  resources, or the ways these are tested and measured—will look surpri-
  difference between a farmer and carpenter. They are both laborers, but the
  different. The farmer thinks about rain and soil, sun and seasons, whereas
  with materials and tools. The farmer weighs their produce on a scale; the
  that the farmer can afford to disregard construction! Even a farmer must

  Consider that trellis. It is a modest structure that exists to raise
  and move the life of a vine across the length of a field. It is a piece of
  construction designed specifically to support and facilitate movement …
  to think about it. This is the nature of movemental architecture.

## PLATFORMED

Before examining the specific structures for building movemental architecture, we must first consider the design principles that inform their creation. How do they differ from principles that people use to maintain the “status” of their institutional “quo”? Most of these principles will be things you are already familiar with, but we choose to state them as reminders, lest they get lost in the shuffle of this essential work.

## Structure Determines Behavior

In the title of his innovativebook The Path of Least Resistance, Robert Fritz expresses one of the most fundamental principles that shapes platform architecture and design. He states that once a structure exists, energy moves through that structure by the path of least resistance. In other words, energy moves where it is easiest for it to go. Thus, the structure of the organization determines the behavior of those that are part of the organization. Bear in mind, this is less a case of “ought” and more a matter of “fact.” It is not that an organization or church’s platform should operate according to the path of least resistance; it just usually does.

  For example, consider the doors of a house versus the windows.

Both doors and windows give people access into a home, but given the choice, people will nearly always choose to walk through the door instead of crawling through the window. It is the path of least resistance. When creating movemental structures, the same is true. As we will examine later, leaders must wrestle through how people, resources, and energy move through their structures. Do the structures facilitate the organizational mission, or do they constrain it?

## The Primacy of Discipleship

“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19a).

The central mission of the church of Jesus Christ is to make disciples.

This should be the foundational design principle that informs all organizational structures. But for some reason, this overt disciplemaking mission is often confused with “decisions for Christ,” where initial conversion is a moment (or moments) in time. Discipleship, however, which includes ongoing metanoia, is a process. Evangelism is an essential component of our faith journey, and our part in the faith journey of others, but it is not nearly as comprehensive as the category of discipleship. Making un-discipled believers is a cataclysmic failure.

And creating structures which only allow for “decisions for Christ” is a cataclysmic reduction of the call to make disciples. All mature disciples of Christ will experience conversion, but not all believers experience discipleship.

  One of the most common issues competing for space with the
  central disciple-making mission of the church is good programs. As
  Jim Collins showed us in his best-selling book Good to Great, great
  most important thing.8 It’s very easy to fill our church calendars with
  members for mission but also take time that could otherwise be spent
  disciple-making mission of the church requires honest and courageous

  The Necessity of Unity and Collaboration

“Love one another … By this everyone will know that you are my disciples” (John 13:34–35, italics ours); “Iin them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you loved me” (John 17:23, italics ours). When we read words and phrases like “by this” or “then,” it should make us pay special attention. Even more so when the words come from the mouth of our Lord. In a church culture that is highly isolated, divided, and competitive, our next design principle as we structure our church or organization for movement, requires us to see other Christian leaders, churches, and organizations not as competitors but as allies—people and organizations with whom we may collaborate. The Scriptures are blatantly clear, both on the mission of the church (to make disciples) and the method for that mission (in unity and love). It is by our demonstrated unity that the world will see and experience the gospel. We must move past the stranglehold of competition that is so prevalent in the church today and begin to structure our organizations to tangibly live out both Jesus’ command and prayer for the unity of his church, as expressed in the Upper Room Discourse, just hours before he would be betrayed, captured, tried, tortured, and crucified on our behalf.

## PLATFORMED

  The Responsibility of All Believers

“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9). Our final design principle reminds us who is responsible for Christ’s mission in the world.

The principle of the priesthood of believers helps us to structure our organizations in a way that maximizes participation by everyone rather than leaving it to the so-called “experts.” Peter is clear that all who are part of the royal priesthood are to proclaim the excellencies of Christ. Thus, effective platform structures help move all participants from consumers to contributors and, better yet, to leaders in the core mission of the organization. This is a fundamental principle of most modern platforms (such as Airbnb or Uber), and active participation for all was normative in the New Testament as well, from the apostolic authors to the countless names in the last chapter of almost every epistle they wrote. This highlights again a commitment to APEST culture—unleashing all the latent spiritual gifts within the community.9

  When designing movemental structures, it’s important that leaders
  help each disciple cultivate their unique, God-ordained vocation rather
  than simply thinking in terms of mass-scale volunteer mobilization for
  life, and it is simply not enough to plug them into a random space where
  Jesus and his mission in the world.10
  Frederick Buechner said, “The place God calls you to is the place where

  your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”11 Volunteerism
  often passionless servitude. Structuring vocation around the former—

Was there a single disciple of Jesus who wasn’t called vocationally first, discipled second, and sent third? Peter, Andrew, James, John, Levi... none of these were picked from the crowds. Jesus walked over to their workplaces and selected them. “Don’t ask yourself what the world needs,” Howard Thurman said. “Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”12 To say it plainly, if we want to see movement, we love people first, disciple them second, find out what they’re good at as a subset of discipleship, and then set them free in their gifts and call—in that order. Movemental organizations do this even when the final result benefits the organization down the street. Hence the necessity of unity and collaboration.

## Designing Structures for Scale

With our basic principles established, we now turn to the work of designing our three overarching types of organizational structures:

   Relationships: People Structures
   Results: Measurement Structures
  Structures are the essential aspect of the platform because they facilitate

  our ultimate goal of scaling the mission. If the old axiom is true, that

  Relationships: Designing People Structures

In designing and building people structures, leaders address how people will best connect, grow, and lead within the organization in order to most effectively accomplish its mission. Most traditional models of church and ministry, rooted in the church-growth paradigm, follow what can be described as a “pipeline,” or industrial structure. Pipelines are based on one-directional flow. (Think Henry Ford and the assembly line making the Model-T.) Following the logic of pipeline structures, churches and ministries produce a program (or product) and deliver it to the people.

This could be a sermon, a children’s or outreach program, and the like.

Although there can be benefits to these highly refined systems—such as high-quality products and efficiency—these structures tend to centralize authority and innovation, while constraining the flow of people and energy. In essence, they are designed more for product delivery than for people movement. Unfortunately, this both breeds and feeds the epidemic of consumerism within the contemporary church.

  One of the key elements of the platform revolution our world is
  experiencing is a move from centralized to decentralized structures.

Centralized, industrial systems tend to be larger with stricter hierarchies and more external laws that govern the hierarchy. Because these

## PLATFORMED

organizations are held together at the top, they are far more susceptible to failure, especially if there is a crisis with the senior leader/s (such as death or moral failure). Conversely, decentralized, networked organizations are held together by internal values, which makes them more resilient and adaptive when change or crisis hits.13

  In networked structures, it is not just decentralization that occurs,
  but democratization,14 as the influence, innovation, and intelligence of
  the people is pushed from the center to the outermost parts of the organi-
  involved and responsible for the mission of the organization, networked
  centralized structures. They tend to grow and reproduce in a far more

  One of the most common ways churches decentralize and
  democratize their relational structures is through their primary disci-
  pleship vehicle. One example might be moving from on-site classes
  homes. Or, taking it further, moving from small groups to a missional
  church, and where community, discipleship, and mission occur. With this
  and equipping those missional communities.
  Perhaps one of the most pronounced shifts in how organic, networked

  organizations operate in relation to people is in the function of leadership.

In decentralized systems, the focus of leadership is not on controlling a hierarchy but on influencing a community. In this way, leadership within organic systems reflects and promotes the inverse hierarchy of the kingdom of God; where the first are last and the last are first; where to live requires first dying to self; where we are called to take the lowly seat at the table. We are citizens of a kingdom whose King didn’t come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for the many. We serve a Lord who washed the feet of his disciples, and then told them to go and do the same (John 13:1–17).17

  This runs counter to contemporary, hierarchical church systems,
  where pastors and leaders are often put on a pedestal, leading to
  high levels of narcissism and a codependent relationship between

  Resources: Designing Operational Structures

In designing and building resource structures, it is the task of leaders to answer how the key internal operations and physical structures of the organization will best facilitate its mission. In traditional, industrial structures, internal systems such as budgets, committees, accounting, and legal requirements can easily become overemphasized, which can lead to some of the clunky bureaucracies evident in the contemporary Western church. Conversely, the internal systems and structures in organic, networked organizations are all too often underdeveloped, making them fragile and vulnerable. All living systems need structure in order to survive and thrive. For instance, if your body didn’t have a skeleton, it would just be a big, useless blob. So, we encourage leaders to pay special attention to creating what we call the minimum viable structure. Here, the responsibility of leadership is to navigate a dynamic tension of developing structures that will not lead to rigid institutionalism and bureaucracy but instead to build enough structure to ensure long-term organizational health and sustainability.

  To carry forward the seed, tree, forest metaphor that undergirds the
  upcurve of the Metanoia Journey, where the organizational platform is
  the tree, think of your minimum viable structure as the trunk. We rarely
  holds the tree upright. If it is too weak, the tree will simply fall over. But

  Arguably the two most important internal operational structures that
  need consideration are the budget and calendar, “For where your treasure
  is, there your heart will be also” (Matthew 6:21). Apart from the Bible and
  theological documents in an organization. How organizations spend

  The physical building and facilities of a church or organization are

  also a key indicator of its resource structure. In 1943, during the height

  Results: Designing Measurement Structures

its mission. The fundamental purpose of platform principles and structures is scalability, so clearly defining and communicating key metrics and measurements allows everyone within the organization to know if the desired scale is being accomplished. As stated earlier, this must be done in tandem with culture development. Specifically, results structures should reflect the internal “shared language” and external “brand promise” of the organization. Additionally, in articulating the collective “win” of the organization, these structures encourage “behavior worth celebrating,” and help build momentum and excitement within the organization.

  What an organization measures indicates what it values and is a
  huge clue to the extent of its missionality. Failure to articulate measu-
  rement structures leads organizations to experience mission drift, causing

Conversely, movemental metrics/measurements, require the organization to go beyond traditional, attractional metrics, and focus on how their relational and resource structures are changing how people live.

Additionally, key movemental metrics will incorporate and reflect both the organizational paradigm examined in the previous chapter and the key design principles listed above. As an example, below are some common measurements we have seen used within highly movemental churches and organizations:

From the culture to structures, never underestimate the importance of getting the organizational platform right. It is the core infrastructure that both forms the people and scales the mission of the organization. Awellarchitected platform is where the Metanoia Journey becomes concrete and, just like the movie I nception, structures the organization to move people through their personal Metanoia Journeys.
