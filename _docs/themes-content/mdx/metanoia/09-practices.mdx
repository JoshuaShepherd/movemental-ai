# Chapter Nine: Practice/s Engaging the Collective Will
  We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.

  —Marshall Mc Luhan
  In short, if you are what you love, and love is a habit,

  then discipleship is a rehabituation of your loves. This
  means that discipleship is more a matter of
  reformation than of acquiring information.
  JA M E S K. A. SM I T H

  Sow a thought and you reap an action; sow an act and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap a
  character; sow a character and you reap a destiny.

  has for our embodied life together, then there is good

  Strengthening the Willpower of the Organization

In the previous chapter, we addressed designing and building the organizational platform. One illustration for platform design that I (Rob) have appreciated over the years is that of hosting a dance. To host a dance, requires various structures—from the dance floor to the stage to the DJ booth to the sound system to the lighting. The emcee sets the culture of the dance by making announcements, choosing the music, and shining


the spotlight on the best dancers. But once they have established all the essential elements of a successful dance party, the one thing the host has no control over is whether or not people actually dance.1 Applying this metaphor to the church, we find ourselves with leaders constantly struggling to help people live out Christ’s mission—to get involved in the proverbial “dance.” Our churches often feel more like a seventh-grade dance, with the majority of attendees standing on the sidelines, segregated into their cliques and talking among themselves. As we look at the church in our current cultural moment, it is clear that the body of Christ is in serious need of help, and although we can’t force participation, we can foster a love of “dancing” and teach people how to “dance.”

  When we’re learning or teaching something new, there is only so far
  that theory can take us. In previous books I (Alan) sought to make a case
  that, from a distinctly biblical understanding of knowledge, it is not so
  way into a new way of thinking.2 What this means is that we learn not
  always, this applies to both the individual as well as the organization. And
  discipling the organization.
  As examined in chapter five, part of discipling the organization

  means becoming a wholehearted organization. This requires engaging the
  and missional practices that the will of the organization is fully engaged.

These practices and disciplines don’t just happen by accident. They must be learned and therefore teaching them is an essential function of leadership for the future of the church. Fortunately, we have the benefit of learning from many historic missional and monastic orders that gathered around a transformative vision (the paradigm/mind of the organization), were focused by a unifying culture and structure (the platform/soul of the organization), and were formed by a common set of practices. Whereas the paradigm (mind) is hidden, and the platform (soul) is experienced, the practices are visible to all because they are a conscious expression of the will. The organization will either choose to do them or not. It is through practices that organizational metanoia becomes tangible and embodied, both to those who are part of the organization as well as the surrounding community.

  If we are to engage the will, we must be motivated and animated
  by love of God and people. People act on what they love, not just what
  they think.3 To be a wholehearted person and organization therefore
  Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and to love
  the will or willpower. Thus, common practices, when motivated by love,
  of the members and the community. In other words, the practices are
  throughout the organization.4 This is the progression of the upcurve, as
  scaled, and the platform is designed for scale, it is through practices that
  its willpower.

## Movemental Rhythms

In addressing the practices of the organization, we will focus on the rhythms and tools needed to help people get off the sidelines and dance.

We love the word rhythm because it refers to movement that occurs in a uniform and recurring pattern. And ultimately, what we are trying to do is both help catalyze and be a part of Jesus’ movement in the world.

To foster healthy rhythms that lead to movement, we will address the following:

   From Core Values to Core Practices
   From Rhythms to Algorithms
  From Core Values to Core Practices

  In the previous chapter, we addressed the importance of core values, which is something most organizations and churches have already identified.

Core values are often put on display on walls, in the literature, on the website and so on. So far so good. The problem arises in trying to actually live them out. One of the reasons for this is because we’ve mainly informed people’s heads and not required anything of their behavior. When we talk about core values in a values-shaped community of believers, it’s hard to


disagree with them (there is a Bible verse associated with each value … and who is going to argue with a verse of Scripture?). Because value statements appeal to what we believe and don’t require much else, the common response for many is mere assent: Of course we believe in evangelism (though we hold back from it in most cases), and of course we believe we must care for the poor (even though we don’t do much of it), and of course we believe in prayer (but seldom practice it). You get the idea.

Stanley Hauerwas states:

  Christianity is not a set of beliefs or doctrines one believes in order to
  one’s habits determined, in such a way that the worship of God is
  take on flesh. If one of our orthodox beliefs has no corporeal value, if
  life together, then there is good reason to ask why we should bother
  spiritual holiness, but whether there is anything beside the body that

  The problem is that simple value statements can easily become plati-
  tudes, which are preferred ideals rather than lived-out values. Without
  the development of practices based on the stated values, establishing core
  way to live. People will rarely assimilate values into their lives by simply

So, rather than simply writing, talking, teaching, and lecturing about culture and values, we suggest you develop common practices that will give people pathways to act their way into a new way of thinking.6 Here are a few:

   Formulate the Core Values. If you haven’t already formed your
  culture, we suggest you do this. Again, for them to be effective, we
   Brainstorm the Core Practices. Gather people from the broadest
  possible ways (practices) each value can be lived out and observed

   Distill and Refine the Core Practices. Review the practices to
  core practices should be regular, everyday life rhythms, as opposed
   Formalize the Core Practices. Select just one (no more than two)
  ensure that these aren’t seen as particularly “religious” or church-
  for instance, if the core value is hospitality, think about ways in
  example, a weekly shared meal, visiting the sick once a month,
   Name the Core Practices. Develop an acronym that sums up
   Encourage and Expect the Core Practices. Expect that
  Encourage the practices through regular incorporation into the
  and rewarding positive behavior by those who are part of the

## From Action to Habits

In a church culture characterized by constant action—much of which is good, but not necessarily fruitful—another way of establishing common practices is through the deliberate development of key habits. Habits are deeply ingrained rhythms in which culture becomes deposited in people in the form of dispositions, capacities, and inclinations that cause people to think, feel, and act in certain ways. These habits—which can either be positive or negative—can eventually become second nature. It’s therefore crucial to recognize the organization as a habit-supporting institution that aims to help people replace bad habits with good ones. Deliberately deciding which habits to pursue will predetermine how the organization will act; it is another way of discipling the organization.

  In his bestselling book on the topic, Charles Duhigg maintains that
  habits consist of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. He suggests
  that to change the habit pattern requires understanding the cue (what
  changing the routine.7 Similar to our concept of meta-ideas, he suggests
  habit patterns that are capable of triggering other habits in the lives of
  would be rethinking small groups. People naturally feel the desire for
  reap the reward of socializing (with a little Bible study tossed in for good
  the routine to a more missional form of discipleship, such as a missional
  forms of intentional discipleship outside the walls of the church building,
  forming missional practices into the community.
  Another way of thinking about building key habits (and thus practices)

  is through the metaphor of addressing old, as well as developing new,
  us to remember certain motor skills and perform them without any
  motor skills such as playing a musical instrument or performing a physical
  task without consciously thinking about it. We all rely on this every day,
  that helps us master complex activities like typing on a keyboard where
  kable thing is that skill retention acquired from muscle memory can last
  hardwired into the brain, ensuring that you do not need to relearn how
  wire together.
  The power of habit, muscle memory, and engaging the will as founda-

  tional to our personal and corporate discipleship formation is an overt
  apostle Paul commends his young disciple to “train yourself to be godly”
  and “persevere” (v.16). In 1 Corinthians 9, Paul explains that we are to

  Understanding the power of habit, we suggest leadership teams
  conduct a thorough evaluation of the key actions of the church or organi-
  zation. Are they part of an intentional discipleship process? What habits
  producing? How are they forming the community? What routines, if
  are part of the community?

## From Rhythms to Algorithms

Have you ever wondered why Facebook beat My Space, Google beat Yahoo, or Amazon beat, well … everyone? The answer: They had better algorithms. Although algorithms and rhythms are similar and highly connected, they are not synonymous. For the sake of clarity, let us explain.

Rhythms are repetitive actions that are fundamentally connected to time intervals (such as two beats per second in music; or daily, weekly,


or monthly actions in life). Similarly, algorithms are built on repetitive actions, but unlike rhythms, algorithms aren’t required to be set to time (although they certainly can be). The one significant distinction algorithms have over rhythms is that algorithms are fundamentally about learning from the repetitive action in order to accomplish a purpose. For instance, in the early nineteenth century, French weaver and merchant, Joseph Marie Jacquard, learned that he could use algorithms to create one of the earliest programmable looms, allowing fabric manufacturers to create beautiful and complex products, such as clothing, rugs, and tapestries.9 This invention played an important role in the development of subsequent programmable machines. And now we all live in a world controlled by computers.

  The importance and power of algorithms cannot be overstated. Our
  world is dominated by them. Algorithms are central to the platform
  revolution we have experienced, as explored in the previous chapter.

Below are some key reasons why algorithms are incredibly powerful when applied to your organizational practices and mission:

  Algorithms posture the organization for ongoing metanoia. Because
  algorithms are fundamentally about learning, it makes them the perfect
  type of practice for achieving organizational metanoia, which is one of
  we expand our minds. Algorithmic practices help organizations build
  simultaneously embedding the learnings of metanoia into its systems and

  Algorithms refine the organizational vision, mission, and strategy.

Algorithms force leaders to paint a picture of what they are trying to accomplish (vision), before designing the steps to accomplish it (mission and strategy). The learnings that come through iterations of the algorithm will constantly inform and improve the mission that the organization is scaling. This is especially powerful when applied to the core disciplemaking mission of the church or organization.

  Algorithms help the organization learn and discern future decisions.

As leadership teams collaboratively examine the learnings that come from algorithmic behavior, they are equipped to make better decisions for the organization. Whether discerning the launch of future programs or initiatives, or helping clarify the process as they step into new and unknown mission fields, algorithms strengthen leadership decision-making.

  Algorithms help “what wants to happen.” Effective algorithms
  help organizations understand people, allowing leaders to match them
  quickly and accurately to how they can best engage in the organization’s
  organization. It shows leaders “what wants to happen” within the people
  giftings. As the For Charlotte Network has grown, my team and I (Rob)

1. Connect with a new pastor or leader in our city, 2) Get to Know them

through surveys and conversation, 3) Match them to the appropriate network, initiative, or tool we have in our platform, and 4) Equip and unleash them to Go and help other pastors and leaders in their sphere of influence to do the same.

  Algorithms are fundamentally movemental. Algorithms are about
  rhythmic action. They are about following specific steps in a set order
  and about accomplishing a purpose. Each of these require movement. In
  Paul, used the following algorithm to train and send disciples, driving
  meaning, the early church would 1) Connect with people far from God, 2)
  Word and obey Jesus’ commands, 4) Gather them into churches that
  the earth.10
  Algorithms can change the game in how a church or organization learns

  and grows. Through consistent application and habituation, they have
  throughout the organization.11

## Movemental Tools

Playing on Winston Churchill’s famous quote about being shaped by our buildings, Marshall Mc Luhan, the man who predicted the internet some thirty years before it was made, once said, “We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.” Mc Luhan and Churchill knew something we would be wise to take note of: the power of tools and architecture. Think of the smartphone sitting on the table right next to you as you read this book. Or maybe you are reading this book on your smartphone. It is


an enormously powerful tool that has completely changed the way we live and operate. Monumental shifts in human history are often tied to the innovation of new tools. Consider how Gutenberg’s printing press preceded the Reformation and Renaissance, or how the internet changed the way every person, church, and organization engages with the world around them.

  Because tools are so powerful and ubiquitous, it is not a matter of
  whether leaders are going to use tools to advance their organizational
  mission but simply a matter of which ones. In the final three years of
  wife and I bought a house that we completely gutted and renovated. My
  hours working next to one another on project after project. While passing
  that I treasure to this day. One of Dad’s classic quotes to me was, “Rob,
  house or an organization, we must ensure we have the right tools for the
  the types of tools an organization must consider as they seek to scale their

## What Good Movemental Tools Do

Here is an overview of why good tools matter and how they empower an organization’s practices, and thus scale their mission:

  Tools build trust in the organization/platform. Trust is the
  currency of mission-based organizations. When selecting what tools
  will help best accomplish your mission, it is important to discern how
  you?
  Tools add value to members/participants. People join churches,

  networks, and organizations out of rational self-interest. They understand
  or tools that help them grow and do the things they feel called to do.

Good tools are adopted at scale because they add value to everyone that is connected to your organizational platform. Tools help people in the organization win in how they feel called to engage in the mission, and in turn, help the organization win.

  Tools fractalize DNA and meta-ideas throughout the organization.

As leaders constantly seek to embed the paradigm, DNA, and metaideas, tools will quickly become a leader’s best friend. In this way, tools are highly formative. As Mc Luhan said, they shape the people within the organization.

  Tools remove friction, enabling scale of your core mission. The most
  effective tools are simple, sticky, and scalable.12 Simply stated, tools make
  it easier for people to do what they are trying to accomplish.
  Tools add capacity to the church/organization. Tools allow leaders to

  equip and enable their people to accomplish the organizational mission

  Tools foster innovation and partnership. All tools exist to solve
  some type of problem. In gathering the tools that are needed to scale the
  mission, the organization may have to innovate. Sometimes, that means
  to borrow or create what is needed to solve the problem.
  In my (Rob) own ministry, I have become increasingly aware of the power

  of good tools. In 2016, my team and I began to identify a major issue
  that desired to see Christ’s mission advanced for the flourishing of our
  we created our first State of the City Report, a coffee tablebook to help
  the actual needs around them. Thebook was filled with research and data
  them, and best practices from some of the most trusted Christian leaders
  resonate. Over the next few years, we distributed over forty-thousand
  most used resources for the church of Greater Charlotte. We then went
  create their own report.
  This tool overwhelmingly met the qualities listed above, as it 1)

  built trust in our network, helping us be known as a reliable source of
  to empower their missional activities; 3) fractalized our meta-ideas
  prayer and his command for unity, focused on collaborative mission for


the flourishing of our city; 4) enabled scale by helping people join our network; 5) added capacity to our organization because people used it when and where they wanted it; and 6) fostered incredible innovation and partnership, both in the writing of thebook (we had more than thirty contributors) as well as in how it was used by organizations to innovate new ways of engaging in Christ’s mission together.

## Types of Movemental Tools

It is not the purpose of this chapter to offer a comprehensive toolbox that can be used in developing a movemental church or organization.

Our goal is to simply outline a few of the major types of tools that shape the collective behavior and practice of the organization. But first, here are a couple of key considerations when discerning which tools to adopt.

  First, in thinking through which tool is right, leaders must consider
  relational dynamics and social spaces. In their excellent book The Church
  as Movement, our friends JR Woodward and Dan White Jr. point out that
  he regularly addressed, healed, and fed crowds; he mobilized the forty and
  pleship with the twelve disciples; and shared more intimate experiences
  out that Jesus well understood what sociologists studying the science
  spaces (70+ people), social spaces (20–50 people), personal spaces (5–12

  2–4 5–12 20–50 50+

  I ntimate Personal Social Public

## Relationships

Each of these spaces meets specific needs and operates differently from the other spaces. We can’t meet our intimate needs in a public space, so it’s not the best place to make disciples. But, since discipleship takes place through imitation, not just information and instruction, deep levels of discipleship can take place in personal spaces where individuals are close enough to see into each other’s lives. We suggest careful consideration of what type of tool will most effectively work in each social space.

It is worth noting that most churches tend to underuse and underestimate the importance of the intimate and social spaces, while leaning too heavily on public spaces (for example, worship gatherings) and personal spaces (for example, small groups).

  A second consideration when thinking through which tools will best
  help accomplish the mission of the organization is how to most effec-
  tively leverage technology. We now live in a world where no matter what
  dangers and abuses, when redeemed, allows leaders to meet their people
  for scale than in an analog form. Each of the following types of tools can

## Physical Tools

Like hammers and screwdrivers, physical tools are things organizations can put in people’s hands that make them more effective in accomplishing their mission. One of our favorite examples was created by our friends Dave Runyon and Jay Pathak, authors of The Art of Neighboring.14 As a resource associated with their book, they created a refrigerator magnet that had a simple image of nine squares in a three-by-three pattern. The center square has an image of a house, titled “You Are Here.” At the top of the magnet is the question, “Who is My Neighbor?” The goal of this magnet is to serve as a constant reminder (every time you open your fridge!) of your neighbors’ names, and, if there are any blank spaces on it, as a prompt to learn your neighbor’s name. The clear purpose of this wonderfully simple tool is to help people live out Jesus’ great commandment to love their literal neighbor. It’s impossible to do that if we don’t even know our neighbor’s name. This tool has become so effective that Dave Runyon will often say when speaking about starting a neighboring movement in a city, “If you have the refrigerator magnet, you don’t need to read my


book.” (That said, we strongly recommend you use the magnet and read thebook.) In 2019, our network mobilized over one hundred churches to participate in a neighboring movement that saw more than 62,000 people participate. This simple tool allowed the movement to scale numerically, but more importantly, it fractalized the DNA/meta-idea of “love thy neighbor” in a new and fresh way throughout the churches in our city.

## Training Tools

As we are clearly taught in Ephesians 4, those that are leading a church or organization in their APEST gifting are called to equip the saints for the work of ministry. This makes it essential for leaders within Christ’s church to be able to discern which type of training is best to enable those they lead to flourish in life and ministry, becoming mature disciple-makers. Training tools help leaders to find the right balance in the training processes they use. Cofounder of MLC, Rich Robinson suggests there are primarily three dimensions to learning—direct experience, which involves a personal engagement in some form of action; equipping, which comes in the form of apprenticeship, with learning passed on from one person to another; and education, which involves a theoretical grasp on ideas and is delivered in a classroom environment.

## Experience Immersion

- Equipping Education Apprentice Classroom

## Training

  We use the tool on the previous page, developed by Rich as part of
  MLC Movement Lab, to help churches and organizations develop a well-
  rounded way of discipling people and developing leaders.
  Traditionally, churches lean strongly on education and offer very

  little in the way of experience and equipping, whereas best practices
  instance, over the course of a year, which do you think is going to lead
  or, regularly meeting with a more mature follower of Jesus for incar-
  and immersion? The irony is that we intuitively know the latter is more
  instance. Who would you rather hire to wire your house: an electrician
  electrician that was apprenticed by a master electrician for several years?
  As churches and organizations consider how to train people, we

  strongly recommend creating discipleship frameworks that bring together
  can be taught in classrooms, modeled in apprenticeships, and practiced
  more memorable, leading to a more meaningful form of discipleship.

For example, in his insightful and practical book Surprise the World, our friend Michael Frost puts forth a training framework of five essential habits for missional discipleship, summarized with the acronym BELLS, which stands for Bless, Eat, Listen, Learn, and Sent.15

  Another helpful example of a discipleship framework created and
  implemented within a local church comes from Red Church in Melbourne,
  led by our friend Mark Sayers. They created the HUDDLE framework,
  of God, Dig into God’s Word, Discern what God is saying through Scripture,
  call.16 One of the things we like so much about this framework (as well
  intentional and concrete practices.

## Communication Tools

Different people respond to different forms of communication.

Therefore, it is imperative for leaders to think through their various


forms of communication and how they are received by a mixed audience.

Using Rich Robinson’s framework, we encourage leaders to leverage three primary forms of communication: narrative, data, and theory.

Communicating in a narrative form is generally used by people who are good storytellers. About a third of listeners resonate highly with stories.

Approximately another third of listeners will respond well to communication expressed in the form of theory. This tends to be people who prefer to see things in abstract ways (for example, scientists, who deal in theories and experiment based on them) and people who love wrestling through big concepts and how they apply to life. And then there is the third of people who love data and want proof (for example, statisticians) and resonate highly with statistical data, graphs, and tables. To reach a whole audience—be it through preaching, teaching, video, writing, or any other medium—leveraging all three dimensions of communication will allow everyone to engage both halves of their brain, leading to better adoption and engagement of the ideas being communicated.

## Joining the Dance

If you have never been to a Greek wedding reception, you are simply missing out. As opposed to the awkwardness of the seventh-grade dance referenced earlier, with all its wallflowers and insecurity, a Greek wedding dance is a joyful, unifying experience. In the dance, there are not just two dancers but at least three, who weave in and out in a wonderful circular motion. As they pick up speed, they stay in perfect synchrony with each other. Eventually they dance so quickly and effortlessly that it becomes a blur, yet each dancer maintains their individual identity. The sheer joy that the Greek wedding dance evokes raises the question, Why? Why does this dance resonate so deeply? It is because it is designed to reflect the divine dance of love within the Trinity.17 We worship an all-loving God, who in his very nature is participating in a divine dance of interdependent persons, and through Christ, is inviting us to join his dance. What a gift!

  The Greek wedding is a beautiful example to the broader church of
  getting the order of the Metanoia Journey right (which stands to reason
  since metanoia is a Greek word!). It starts with guests arriving at the
  has been cultivated over time in community, and reflects the all-loving,
  the platform, with all the amazing food, music, and decorations (and don’t
  older participants teach the younger ones to dance in rhythm as a unified
  metanoia!).
  As you have probably surmised by this point, the upcurve of the

  Metanoia Journey, although involving an incredible amount of work,
  (paradigm), to shaping the collective soul (platform), to engaging the
  zation you lead will be poised to change the world. With each aspect of
  experiencing the joy of metanoia.

## Wash, Rinse, Repeat

The word “final” is in quotes in the previous paragraph because in many ways the journey of learning, of reaching for perfection, is never completed. Therefore, once you have gone through an arduous process of adaptive change in your life and organization, we suggest you will need to gather your energies and commit to another Metanoia Journey to the next peak! This is entirely consistent with the principle of ongoing metanoia.

  Until God’s kingdom comes, we will never experience perfection.

Arriving at the current peak is the result of having taken the dangerous journey. It’s a genuine prize and must be celebrated as an achievement, but it cannot be understood as the final destination. Without continued growth, obsolescence will eventually set it. All it will take is the next major disruptive event to highlight the problems inherent in the prevailing model, whatever they might be. If you become complacent and fall in love with your system (ideas, tools, practices), you will lose the capacity to change it.

  We have already noted that all true learning (and innovation) is an
  iterative phenomenon. There are always new challenges to be faced, new
  crises to be overcome, new wicked problems to be solved. Therefore,

  remember that church is something of an “infinite game,” where there is
  ultimately no such thing as “winning” because there’s always a new set
  itself. This is what commits us to the ongoing discipleship journey of un/
  our most recent successes, or to rest on our laurels, but instead to always
  fulfill the mission that God has set out for us.
  Regular metanoia is not a burden but is the root of ongoing fruit-

## Being Eternally Young

Childlikeness comes highly commended by Jesus, who says that the kingdom of God “belongs” to children, and unless we too become childlike, we have no hope of entering it (Mark 10:14–15). He goes further, saying, “Truly I say to you … unless you turn and become like children, you will
