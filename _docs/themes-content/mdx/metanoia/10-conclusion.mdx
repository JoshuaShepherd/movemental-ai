# CONCLUSION

<!-- INCOMPLETE TEXT - REQUIRES SOURCE REVIEW: Text starts mid-sentence at "never enter the kingdom of heaven" - missing opening quote/context -->

"Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3–4 ESV, italics ours). Jesus champions childlikeness because children are naturally humble and playful. They are often deep in un/learning mode, and frequently accept they have much more to discover.

  Childlike thinking is essentially metanoic because it is invariably
  open to wonder and ongoing un/learning. Apparently what we all
  need is a “beginner’s mind”—an approach to the world that is truly
  path for all spiritual wisdom.3 Although childlike reverence and awe is
  a prerequisite in any field of knowledge. Most people hesitate to ask

But Albert Einstein loved such questions. He never thought of things in terms of what was possible or not possible. Even as an adult, Einstein retained the playful curiosity of a child. He believed in the power of imagination, and this meant he always approached a problem creatively.

In a letter to Carl Seelig, one of his biographers, Einstein claimed: “I have no special gifts. I am only passionately curious.”4 Understanding with other quantum physicians that observing something changes it, he retained a deep love for childlike curiosity: “The main source of all technological achievements is the divine curiosity and playful drive of the tinkering and thoughtful researcher, as much as it is the creative imagination of the inventor.”5

  The seminal philosopher Michael Polanyi also made direct links
  with childlikeness and metanoia, believing that “metanoia is a specia-
  lized, intensified adult form of the same world-view development found
  involves the same kind of thinking as a child, alongside the tools of logical
  key. Most rational structuring is bought at the price of this childlike
  great creative people. It is recovering this type of thinking that brings
  reorganized. In other words it enables metanoia, the “Eureka!” illumi-

  Thus we finally come to the end of this book. We hope the journey
  will have shown you what an incredible gift repentance really is and that
  it is a joy to undergo because it enables us to have a renewed experience of
  and opens us up to new and unforeseen possibilities.
  If you long to see God radically transform you, your church, and your

  organization from the inside out, we pray you will have the courage to
  challenges feel overwhelming, knowing that Christ is always present,
  metanoia as God’s precious gift and that you and those you lead might
  he longs to bear in his people.

3 It was Einstein who repeatedly insisted that the problems of the world cannot be resolved by the same kind of thinking that created the problems in the first place.

4 Another reason for the rather dense nature of this book is that the Western church suffers from a serious problem of pragmatism. We tend to shortcut the learning process, and to adopt someone else’s plug-and-play app to achieve spiritual and missional renewal.

Of course, the five-step miracle solution is a unicorn. It never works, and becomes mere patchwork that only further obscures the real problem at hand. We think that faulty pragmatism is more than half of the problem because, as we will see in chapter six, real transformational change requires us to first descend into the valley before being able to climb to the next peak. To engage the deepest paradigmatic issues we are facing, we must first address the underlying theological foundations on which our systems and structures are built. Otherwise, any changes made will be simply cosmetic and surface level.

5 “In systematically ‘drawing out’ the implications of revelation theology fulfills its ‘function’ within the Church as a corrective to any impulse, be it ‘charismatic’ or ‘institutional,’ that seeks to ground the Church in anything other than this faithful surrender to the Christ-form” Larry Scott Chapp, The Theological Method of Hans Urs von Balthasar (PhD diss., Fordham University, 1994), 306. Theology is not an ossified wall that signifies closure of a thought and conversation but rather a “point of departure” for a way of viewing the world that seeks to ground all things in Christ and to thereby “retrieve” its true meaning.

- Part One: Why Metanoia (Introduction)

1 Witness the rise of the so-called “microchurch movement.” This form of ecclesia is as old as the New Testament itself and has characterized all transformative Jesus movements in history, such as the early church, the Celtic movements, early Methodism, and the Chinese underground church. But this form has largely been ignored because it doesn’t fit the paradigm or the metrics of Christendom churches and is ill-suited to serve the interests of hierarchy. In the current complex conditions, the microchurch form is being rediscovered as not only a more viable (and much less expensive) way of organizing, but also one that serves the dynamics of genuine movements much better than the unreproducible forms of the megachurch or the complex traditional forms of legacy churches.

4 As believers, this should not be so strange to us. Jesus warned that when the powers in the heavens are shaken, there will be confusion, violence, and troubles on earth (Luke 21:24–31). Not only does the Bible contain a fair bit of apocalyptic literature of its own, but scholars also affirm that much of the New Testament is framed through a distinctly eschatological, apocalyptic lens and that it cannot be properly understood apart from this frame.

7 Then there are the genuinely apocalyptic (revelatory/unveiling) events related to the United States alone. In 2020, America experienced at least five category-five cultural tsunamis.

Everything from the pandemic to the social unrest surrounding the death of George Floyd, to the political polarization, to the economic downturn—all of which contributed to the spike in mental health issues—had a transformative effect on the US, and in turn the world.

superpower, has historians saying that the so-called “American century” that began at the end of World War II is officially over. The deep political polarization in the US, which has been growing exponentially over the past two decades, reached its height with the election and presidency of Donald Trump and culminated with the riots at the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021. No matter your particular political viewpoints, there is no denying that such events seriously damaged America’s credibility and leadership on the world stage, and the role of apparent Christian leaders at the core of the polarization has had negative effects on the witness of believing Christians across the Western world but particularly in the US: “Ohh, so that’s what Christians really believe and how they behave.” 8 https://www. powerthesaurus. org/crisis/definitions (accessed February 28, 2023).

7 Te/shuva is therefore capable of renewing a person from within as well as changing their relations to God and God’s world. Martin Buber emphasizes the turning to God (teshuva) as an act that is done with your whole being, which can only mean with all your passion, and he identifies it with the return to the good. Still more clearly, he speaks of the teshuva as taking place “when man turns away from evil with that whole measure of power with which he is able to rebel against God.” But Buber also speaks of the turning in a positive sense as turning from the way of man to that of God and perfecting God’s image in oneself. “The fundamental way of encountering YHWH is through fear of God and through reversal, through a turning which brings ever new areas of the world into theophany and brings us ever closer to God.” Maurice S. Friedman, Martin Buber: Mystic, Existentialist, Social Prophet: A Study in the Redemption of Evil (PhD. diss., University of Chicago, June 1950), 238.

8 (Pes. 54a[3]; Ned. 39b[4]; Gen. R. i.). “The Holy One, blessed be His name, said to Elijah, ‘Behold, the precious gift which I have bestowed on my world: though a man sinneth again and again, but returneth in penitence, I will receive him’” (Yer. Sanh. 28b[5]). “Great is repentance: it brings healing into the world”; “it reaches to the throne of God” (comp. Hos. xiv.

2, 5); “it brings redemption” (comp. Isa. lix. 20); “it prolongs man’s life” (comp. Ezek. xviii.

21; Yoma 86a[6], b). “Repentance and works of charity are man’s intercessors before God’s throne” (Shab. 32a[7]). Sincere repentance is equivalent to the rebuilding of the Temple, the restoration of the altar, and the offering of all the sacrifices (Pesi., ed. Buber, xxv. 158; Lev. R. vii). See article on repentance in the Jewish Encyclopaedia Sanh, https://www. jewishencyclopedia. com/articles/12680-repentance (accessed February 28, 2023).

9 Repentance has its subjective and psychological aspects, of course, but essentially it is “as little a ‘spiritual’ event as is a person’s birth or death; [rather] it comes upon the whole person and is carried out by the whole person. The turning is something that happens in the immediacy of the reality between man and God. For the sake of the turning, the Hasidic masters have said, ‘was the world created.’” Will Herberg, The Writings of Martin Buber (New York: Meridian Books, 1960), 28–9.

Remarkably, this book is over one hundred years old and is the only substantial one that we have found that is dedicated to an exploration of the idea of metanoia! This huge gap in our scholarship accounts in large part for our lack of understanding of the term and what it represents. Go figure!

19 J. I. Packer similarly notes that the infusing of Hebrew understanding of teshuva and the Greek understanding of metanoia requires that we see change as comprehensive, involving all aspects of the human being. “The New Testament word for repentance means changing one’s mind so that one’s views, values, goals, and ways are changed and one’s whole life is lived differently. The change is radical, both inwardly and outwardly; mind and judgment, will and affections, behavior and life-style, motives and purposes, are all involved. Repenting means starting to live a new life.” J. I. Packer, Concise Theology: A Guide to Historic Christian Beliefs (Wheaton, IL: Tyndale, 1995), 162.

20 Devenish, The Mind of Christ, 345–6. For Devenish, the “keys” to the Christian worldview are its Christ-centeredness, its call for an exclusive commitment, and its rejection of a selfand world-centered concern in matters of morality and personal self-gratification, in favor of a life which is pleasing to God. He calls this aspect of metanoia, “the acquisition of mind.” Ibid., 60.

21 “But let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, that which is good and pleasing and perfect” (Rom 12:2–3 NLT). The present-imperative form of the verb metamorphous indicates the ongoing dimension of transformation in the life of faith.

22 This knowledge is essential to understanding that conversion is really a response of love to the unconditional love poured out on the person while still a sinner (Rom 5:6–11).

Comments by Daniel W. Mc Quire in his thesis, Encounter–Call–Mission: Conversion in the writings of Hans urs Von Balthasar (PhD diss., Marquette University, 2007), 43–4.

23 There may be momentous events or even several such events, but the conversion process is not often completed with speed. Peter is arguably the best example of a conversion moving forward in fits and starts. Despite his declaration of faith in the divinity of Christ (Mt 16:16) and the great reward promised for such faith (Mt 16:18), it is clear that Peter remained confused even to the shores of Tiberius (Jn 21:15ff ). Peter’s conversion was more labored in that he was drawn to Jesus earlier on but had a slower metanoic process where his mind struggled to catch up with what he was experiencing in walking alongside Jesus. As for existential encounter, consider Paul’s conversion; not only what he radically reoriented but the shattering and reconstruction of his religious paradigms. Both event and process are two sides of the same coin.

27 This is almost certainly what the poet William Blake meant when he talked about “the doors of perception” being cleansed, enabling us to see things in their truer, more infinite, light.

28 Hirsch and Nelson, Reframation, 82. What is important to recognize at this point is that the New Testament builds on and develops the Old Testament teaching by adding a decidedly noetic element to the concept of repentance.

30 Similarly, my (Rob) experience in beginning the For Charlotte Network was like this. As a pastor in a church, I was deeply burdened by the division I was experiencing within my local church and between the churches of our city. It drove me to toward deeper study, prayer, and learning. It forced me to study new and different disciplines (technology, history, network science, etc.). I knew that this division wasn’t God’s plan for his church, but I didn’t know what a healthy system could look like. I began traveling to other cities to see how God was moving. And finally, shaped by the overwhelming conviction of Jesus’ prayer for the oneness of his church, I took the leap of faith to begin our network.

31 Abraham Heschel, Man is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1979), Kindle edition. Poet Gerard Manley Hopkins coined the term “inscape” to describe what is involved in becoming aware of the “manifold wisdom” made known in the church. I nscape is contrasted to the idea of a landscape, which is what we objectively see spread out before us against the horizon. It is relatively stable and can be described, painted, and cultivated. I nscape, on the other hand, sees the inner meaning of things; it is that intuitive sense that what we are seeing in a flash of insight is a living, organic form that strikes through the senses and into the mind with a feeling of novelty and discovery. I nscape involves becoming aware of what seems to be hidden and obscure and yet is so near at hand; that which—if only we had the eyes to see it—could be recognized through all dimensions of life. “I nscape is what something uniquely is, that which holds together whatever you are looking at or listening to, gives it distinction—proportions, shades of light, tints of color, shapes, relationships, sounds … Reading and reciting the poems of Hopkins is an immersion in inscape, a thorough and glorious apprenticeship in sensing the invisibles and inaudibles that give cohesion and wholeness to everything that we see and hear and taste, not just its superficial appearance but the inner core of individuality.” See Eugene Peterson, Practice Resurrection, A Conversation on Growing Up in Christ (Grand Rapids, Eerdmans, 2013), 19, 139–140. To be sure, Heschel is here talking about what he calls “the ineffable” but also how it is accessed by way of immediate and personal insight.

fact, there is a whole discipline of study dedicated to what is called “the eureka effect” or simply insight studies. See https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Eureka_effect (accessed February 28, 2023). Philosopher Martin Buber notes that “undergirding every scientific discovery is some moment of intuition or confrontation. Therefore, all essential knowledge begins with an I-Thou encounter, and is contained in an enduring concept.” Martin Buber, “Replies to My Critics,” in The Philosophy of Martin Buber: The Library of Living Philosophers (La Salle: Open Court, 1967), 692. Likewise, physicist Alan Lightman sees this as the critical dimension in the psychology of creative breakthroughs in art and science in his book A Sense of the Mysterious: Science and the Human Spirit (New York: Pantheon, 2005).

6 It is interesting to note that what became known as The Confessing Church was the faithful response of German speakers to the decidedly nationalistic German Church. The word confessing here should not be lost, in that it involved confessing of sins and not just of statements of theology.

7 Prophetic ministry throughout human history would not make any sense if collective repentance and turning were not required by God. One of the signature terms of the prophet is “repent” for the kairos is upon us (as Jesus says in Mt 4:17). On the issue of the German church, Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work in calling it to account for the sins of racism and hatred is well documented. He was martyred for his effort.

8 One of the most remarkable examples of collective repentance and metanoia has emerged from the very churches that were complicit in apartheid. It’s called the Confession of Belhar and can be read here: https://www. pcusa. org/site_media/media/uploads/theologyandworship/pdfs/belhar. pdf (accessed February 28, 2023).

13 “Images I must suppose, have their use or they would not have been so popular. (It makes little difference whether they are pictures and statues outside the mind or imaginative constructions within it.) To me their danger is more obvious. Images of the Holy easily become holy images—sacrosanct. My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks of His presence? The Incarnation is the supreme example; it leaves all previous ideas of the Messiah in ruins. And most are ‘offended’ by the iconoclasm; and blessed are those who are not. But the same thing happens in our private prayers. All reality is iconoclastic.” C. S. Lewis, A Grief Observed (New York: Faber & Faber, 2015), 76–7.

14 In Reframation, we make the claim that all our problems are the result of reductionisms in our understanding of God, people, gospel, and mission. Reductionism happens when we take big ideas and reduce them down to containable god-in-a-box type formulas. This effectively fragments our knowledge of God and the things of God by breaking them down and reducing them to suit a limited human rationality. In fact, this is exactly what the New Testament labels as “heresy”; to grasp a fragment of truth and then make the claim that the fragment we have laid claim to is the only truth or the whole truth. Reductionism is problematic in any field of knowledge, but it is particularly problematic when it comes to the knowledge of the transcendent God. Hirsch and Nelson, Reframation, chapters one to three.

16 It is worth noting here that none less than Machiavelli commented that, “There is nothing more difficult and dangerous, or more doubtful of success, than an attempt to introduce a new order of things. For the innovator has for enemies all those who derived advantages from the old order of things, whilst those who expect to be benefited by the new institutions will be but lukewarm defenders. This indifference arises in part from fear of their adversaries who were favored by the existing laws, and partly from the incredulity of men who have no faith in anything new that is not the result of well-established experience. Hence it is that, whenever the opponents of the new order of things have the opportunity to attack it, they will do it with the zeal of partisans, whilst the others defend it but feebly, so that it is dangerous to rely upon the latter.” Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince (Random House, 2012), Kindle edition, Kindle locations 1026–31.

induce a “peculiar form of self-hypnosis” whereby people remain as unaware of the psychic and social effects of their new technology as a fish of the water it swims in. It is precisely at the point where a new media-induced environment becomes all pervasive that it also becomes invisible. For instance, notice how blind we now are to the ubiquitous presence of the internet. We assume its rightness even though it is a relatively new technology. It touches every aspect of our lives now without our even realizing it.

23 I [Alan] have learned much about Catholic understandings of tradition and the role of the magisterium from dialogues with my friend and colleague, Catholic missiologist Fr.

James Mallon. He notes that Catholics recognize a distinction between what they call “Sacred Tradition” and mere “traditions” (small t versus capital T). In Catholic thought especially, it’s the capital “T” tradition that has authority in helping us interpret Scripture, not small “t” traditions. It’s a fixation on small “t” traditions that give us traditionalism.

In Roman Catholic understanding, “the magisterium” (from magister or “teacher”) means the teaching office or function of the church. It serves Scripture and Tradition. Capital “T” tradition is not so much a collective canon but represents the historic memory of the church that includes the great theologians from the Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Age, as well as the church fathers, writings of the various saints and mystics over time—exactly what you get when you have babies and pass on the memory of how things have been believed and lived out in the past, a kind of living memory.

24 In fact, at its worst, traditionalism is associated with what the New Testament calls the stoicheaia... the elemental spirits/principles that are part of the fallen power and principalities (Col 2:16–23; Gal 4:3). Traditionalism, precisely because it is an -ism, can be oppressive; we need only read the Gospels for evidence of that. Leaders know how resistant the church itself can become to the mission of God and what an impediment that is to the advancement of the gospel.

26 The MRS GREN acronym, for instance, is often used to help remember all the necessary features of living organisms: Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion and Nutrition. Likewise, humans, and by extension human organizations, require all seven functions, including excretion, to be fully functional. See for instance, “MRS GREN,” Basic Biology, https://basicbiology. net/biology-101/mrs-gren (accessed February 28, 2023).

27 And we ought not to be so shocked in using the term “crap” to refer to religious traditions: Paul references the same term (σκύβαλον—refuse, dregs, excrement, rubbish) when he says in Phil 3:8 that he considers all things as excrement in order that he may gain Christ.

kind of map, “When the root metaphors change, so does everything else.” 32 Think about how the parish model in Britain was designed for people who were born, raised, and lived their whole lives in a certain region. There was a church assigned to that parish by decree of parliament. Now those lines don’t exist, as everyone comes from everywhere and goes everywhere. And yet the Church of England adheres to these now very arbitrary mental boundaries to its great detriment. The parish system has been rightly called the condom of the Anglican church. Another example, as we have already noted, is that most seminaries train people for a role that no longer exists.

38 The quantum physicist Max Planck eulogizes childlike thinking in contributing to advances in science: “The feeling of wonderment is the source and inexhaustible fountainhead of [the child’s] desire for knowledge. It drives the child irresistibly on to solve the mystery, and if in his attempt he encounters a causal relationship, he will not tire of repeating the same experiment ten times, a hundred times, in order to taste the thrill of discovery over and over again. The reason why the adult no longer wonders is not because he has solved the riddle of life, but because he has grown accustomed to the laws governing his world picture... He who does not comprehend this situation, misconstrues its profound significance, and he who has reached the stage where he no longer wonders about anything, merely demonstrates that he has lost the art of reflective reasoning.” Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography (New York: Citadel, 1949), 91–3. The nifty term “adultish” is used by author and friend Mandy Smith.

39 We recommend Mandy Smith’s wonderful book Unfettered: Imagining a Childlike Faith beyond the Baggage of Western Culture (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2021) for an exploration of what it means to recover childlikeness in an overly-adultish church.

He is the cornerstone of the whole theological edifice, being the holistic norm for theology.

3 Sacramentality involves the ability to experience events with what Richard Kearney calls a “micro-eschatology” and “epiphanies of the everyday.” He writes, “What if we were to return to epiphanies of the everyday? What if we could come back to the end in the here and now?... What if we could rediscover ourselves again face-to-face with the infinite in the infinitesimal? Touch the sacred enfolded in the seeds of ordinary things? Such a return would invite us to experience the ultimate in the mundane. The first in the last. The most in the least. It would bring us into dialogue with those who seek the divine in the pause between two breaths. Transcendence in a thornbush. The Eucharist in a morsel of madeleine. The Kingdom in a cup of cold water. San Marco in a cobblestone. God in a street cry.” Richard Kearney, “Epiphanies of the Everyday: Toward a Micro-Eschatology,” in John Panteleimon Manoussakis, After God: Richard Kearney and the Religious Turn in Continental Philosophy, Perspectives in continental philosophy, no. 49 (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 3.

6 Note the combination of re/turn and paradigm shift that together form the biblical basis of metanoia here. See Mc Grath, Re-Imagining Nature, 51. Likewise, John Calvin pointed to the double derivation of the Hebrew and Greek words for “repentance”: the Hebrew derives from conversion, or turning again, and the Greek means a change of mind and purpose.

The meaning of the word, for Calvin, is appropriate to both derivations because repentance a) involves “withdrawing from ourselves,” b) turning to God, c) “laying aside the old,” and d) putting on “a new mind.” John Calvin, I nstitutes of the Christian Religion 3 (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1995), 1–16. Loder and Neidhardt describe the mind of Christ as being endowed by the Holy Spirit, and, far from being something which is other-worldly and unrelated to a real assessment of this world, enables the religious actor to “behold this world as if for the first time” because it is knowing the world through the Logos, or the creative and redemptive personage of Christ. Calvin spoke of this vision as being imbibed from the Christian Scriptures in terms of the reception of “spectacles” which disclose the “pure knowledge of God.” Loder and Neidhardt, The Knight’s Move, quoted in Devenish, The Mind of Christ, 323.

8 “Poor fool—he thought his mind was his own. Never his own until he makes it Christ’s; up till then, merely a result of heredity, environment, and the state of his digestion. I became my own only when I gave myself to Another.” C. S. Lewis, in Letters of C. S. Lewis (July 17, 1953), para. 2, 251.

11 Von Balthasar, Prayer, 131. On the role of the Spirit in the knowledge of God we can say that if Jesus is the One who interprets God and makes him known in the world (John 1:18), then it is the purpose of indwelling Spirit to interpret Jesus to us—Spirit to spirit.

Jesus himself said as much: “[The Spirit] will guide you into all truth... it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you” (Jn 16:13–14). “[T]he Holy Spirit can be recognized at work in a person by establishing in him the mind of Jesus and forming Christ in us. We have received this Spirit, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God” (1 Cor 2:11f). Thus, access to this Jesus-Logic is a work of the Spirit of Christ in us who makes Jesus personal to us. Without the Spirit, the picture our spirit makes of Jesus is pale and flat, unable to embrace the tensions in which Jesus reveals the unity of God’s innermost mind. This is sufficiently proved by the innumerable pictures of Jesus, drawn after the artist’s own liking; pictures of a mild, dull Savior whose “solidarity” with the poor, oppressed, and sinners no longer glows red hot, and where nothing divine shines through. Paul dismisses all such “human, all-too-human” pictures painted “according to the flesh.” Hans Urs von Balthasar, Does Jesus Know Us? Do We Know Him?

12 Von Balthasar, Prayer, 131.

13 Von Balthasar notes that, through the work of the Spirit in the believer, “[T]he whole profundity of God’s truth is present, open and available to us … however, the Spirit introduces believers to it progressively, by declaring and interpreting to them the revelation of the Word in Jesus, and incorporating them into it (Jn 16:13 f). The Spirit, who alone knows the ‘hidden things of God’, who ‘searches everything, even the depths of God’, has in principle opened up these depths to the ‘spiritual’, to ‘those who possess the Spirit’, who ‘have the mind of Christ’ … The word of God, and all it involves, operates ‘from Spirit to spirit’. The Holy Spirit of the prophets and the Incarnation carries the Father’s word to us,

and the same Holy Spirit interprets it in a divine and spiritual sense in their souls, leading the human spirit back to the Father by means of God’s word.” Von Balthasar, Prayer, 71–73.

14 Jean Daniélou, God and the Ways of Knowing (San Francisco: I gnatius, 1957), 174–5. Paul employs the strongest image for this impressing of the knowledge of Jesus into the heart of the believer: he compares it to the original creation of light out of darkness: “For it is the God who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ” (2 Cor 4:6).

15 Hans Urs von Balthasar, Spirit and I nstitution: Explorations in Theology, IV (San Francisco: I gnatius Press, 1995), 443.

16 “Christ is the primary pattern of Christianity: in his face the glory of God shines and from there radiates into the heart of Christians (2 Corinthians 4:6)... He is the one and only exposition of God (John 1:18), infinitely rich and of a paradoxical simplicity that integrates all the elements. He is absolute sovereignty and absolute humility; he is infinitely approachable who can be reached by everyone and infinitely inaccessible, ever beyond reach.” Bede Mc Gregor and Thomas Norris, The Beauty of Christ, 216.

17 To understand what Christoformity means, however, we need to understand this seemingly strange term “the form of Christ,” and to do this, we need to in turn understand the term “form,” upon which it is built. Essentially the form of something is the overall pattern, the design, a complete representation of a phenomenon that presents itself to us. The form is the figure, shape, or configuration of something; the particular way in which a thing exists or appears; its aesthetic impact. In German the word for form is gestalt, which in general psychology has come to mean the organized whole that is seen as more than the sum of its parts. This is important because it is the form that enables us to make sense of what we are seeing because it is knowing the whole that enables us to make sense of the parts. For instance, if someone showed you an apple core, you could, on the basis of your understanding of the total form of apples, “reconstruct” what the original apple might have looked like. This is because you know the form/pattern of apples. Similarly, this works with different styles of music. For instance, blues has a certain pattern that repeats itself throughout all forms of blues music. We can sense the genre by hearing a few chords— sensing its signature. Rock is the same, as is Celtic, I ndian, African, and all other forms of music styles. Or, think about the competitions on music radio, where the listener has to recognize a song from a three-second sample of its chorus. So if we said “another brick in the wall” or hummed the famous Pink Floyd tune, you would no doubt recognize the entire song from just that line. Likewise, a doctor can recognize a disease by comparing it to the total pattern of health by which it is measured and assessed. It is by seeing the whole that we can make sense of the parts that we see.

18 “In the one Person of Christ, the individual’s election, calling and justification become equally personal; the grace offered and communicated to him by the Father has a unique quality which arises from the Son’s uniqueness and bears its mark; it is equally divine and supernatural as it is human and natural (because it comes from the grace of the God-Man, is permeated by it and is given in view of it). On the one hand it is made to man’s measure, and on the other hand it has per se a Son-like and hence Word-like form. We say ‘form’ [Gestalt] in the absence of a better word to designate this mysterious reality, which is both the ideal archetype of redeemed and believing man in Christ and his own, authentic reality as the Father sees and judges him from now on, a reality according to which, as a believer, he is challenged to live. In faith he enters into his ‘christoform self ’; Paul calls this ‘putting on Christ’ (Rom 13:14; Gal 3:27), ‘putting on the new nature’ (Eph 4:24; Col 3:10), ‘Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience … as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive … And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body … Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly’ (Col 3:12–16).” Von Balthasar, Prayer, 59.

22 Bonhoeffer understood this and called the church “the form of Christ in the world.” The body/embodiment of Christ is meant to resonate with exemplary Christlikeness for the world to see what God is like. “The Church is nothing but a section of humanity in which Christ has truly taken form.” See also John A. Phillips, The Form of Christ in the World: A Study of Bonhoeffer’s Christology (London: Collins, 1967) and J. A.

24 If a group claiming to be a Christian church fails to look/act/sound/think like Jesus, their Founder and Archetype, then we can only conclude that either it was a church sometime in the past and that it has the cultural forms of being a church but is on its way out, or that it’s on its way to becoming a church, but in its current form, is not actually the body of Christ.

How else will we recognize the authentic church? What other measure for the church do we have other than Jesus?

25 “In other words, all the events and turning points that together constitute Jesus’ earthly ministry become, through the Holy Spirit, the dynamic framework within which every human life can come to fulfillment. It is not that the historical shape of the Incarnation is lost, in von Balthasar’s view, by its ongoing inclusion of the redeemed, but rather the shape it attains through Jesus’ historical ministry is the very pattern into which Christ’s people come to participate.” Mark A. Mc I ntosh, The Doctrine of the Incarnation in Hans Urs von Balthasar (PhD diss., University of Chicago, 1993), 264.

26 In thinking through the mind of Christ, “the structure of human thought remains the same, but the stand-point of the whole person’s being—from which one thinks, wills, and perceives—has been changed … The effects on the sphere of consciousness are indirect and successive, corresponding to the readiness with which the free person assents to this new inclination which has been bestowed upon him and made available to him, the readiness with which he allows this inclination to take root in him and permits it to have its effects on the clearly perceived and psychologically graspable personal sphere. Thus, no sharp line can be drawn where the infused virtues with their vital centre in caritas, begin to unfold consciously as the ‘gifts of the Holy Spirit’. Ontologically, these gifts are already contained in the gift of grace itself and in the new inclination and readiness that are bestowed with it.

But it is up to the believer and the lover to allow this inclination to gain an ever increasing ascendancy in his life of faith … The love which is infused in man by the Holy Spirit present

27 “Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.

For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory” (Col 3:1–4). In his commentary on Colossians 3:2, Christopher Seitz notes that the term zēteite in 3:1 means “to seek,” or “set your hearts on” is chosen to capture the sense of “orient yourself according to” and to parallel phroneō in 3:2, which is rendered as “set your minds on.” The command is to “seek instead things above where Christ is.” Paul is therefore saying that we must operate in this world with our attention firmly focussed on Christ at the right hand of God (cf. Rom 8:5; Phil 3:19). Colossians: Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2014).

29 The presence of the Spirit constantly “lifts” the individual believer into conformity with the mind of God. “Faith, the foundation of all our understanding of revelation, expands our created minds by making them participate in the mind of God, disclosing the inward divine meaning of the words through a kind of coworking with God; for this reason it is the saint, the person most open to the working of the Spirit, who arrives at the closest understanding. He will not do what the ordinary man, so dominated by original sin, does almost unawares, yet with such desperate persistence: confine the meaning of God’s word within human bounds, admitting its truth only to the extent that it corresponds to human forms of thought and ways of life.” Hans Urs von Balthasar, Explorations in Theology, I: The Word, Scripture and Tradition (San Francisco: I gnatius Press, 1989), 21.

33 Even in the final heavenly state, where we will all possess the beatific vision, we will never fully comprehend God. In fact, the more we think we have grasped God, the more we realize that we have not grasped him—God is always the “ever greater” and cannot be fully grasped by the human mind. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 ad maintained that God’s immanence and knowability is always qualified by an ever-greater transcendence and unknowability: It acknowledged an “ever-greater dissimilarity however great the similarity,” which in effect teaches that between Creator and creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater dissimilarity cannot be seen between them.

This is what poet-scientist Maria Popova means when she confesses her love of the mathematical calculus behind the concept of pi (π). For her, pi functions as both an anchor of reality and a counterpoint to certainty. For her, pi provides a reminder that despite the rigor and devotion with which we may attempt to map reality, our maps remain what they are; incomplete, representational models that always leave more to map, more to fathom. And this, she suggests, should not surprise us because the same forces that made the universe also made the mind—what she calls the “figuring instrument”—with which we try to figure it all out.

38 Confirmation bias, also known as “myside bias,” is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports your prior beliefs or values.

People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. The effect is strongest for people who desire certain predetermined outcomes, in emotionally charged issues, and for those with deeply entrenched beliefs.

Confirmation bias cannot be eliminated entirely, but it can be managed, for example, by education and training in critical thinking skills. See Raymond S. Nickerson, “Confirmation bias: Aubiquitous phenomenon in many guises,” Review of General Psychology, 2 (1998): 175–220. A “self-sealing argument” likewise is an argument that is unfalsifiable in that it is set up in such a way that it is impossible to contradict or refute, so that no counterarguments or evidence could possibly be used against it.

39 Nobody wants to admit to themselves that they’re closed-minded, especially in relation to God, and particularly those closed-minded people who have developed a powerful religious rationale for their close-mindedness. God has always struggled with spiritual blindness in his people (e. g., Mk 8:18). In addition to asserting that most people think only once in their lives, usually when they are at college, Heschel notes that “After that their minds are made up, and their decisions, utterances are endless repetitions of views that have in the meantime become obsolete, outworn, unsound. This applies to politics, scholarship, the arts as well as to social service. Views, just as leaves, are bound to wither, because the world is in flux. But so many of us would rather be faithful to outworn views than to undergo the strain of re-examination and revision. Indeed, intellectual senility sets in long before physical infirmity. Ahuman being can be assessed by how many times he was able to see the world from a new perspective [i. e., metanoia].” This is sadly very true.

40 And as we have seen, closed-loop thinking is particularly problematic when it comes to God’s people. According to Paul in 2 Cor 3, it led to the veiling/narrowing/closing of the Jewish mind when it came to recognizing what God was up to in the person of Jesus—who was the fulfilment of the messianic pattern.

47 An understanding of spiritual instincts is further strengthened by adding the church’s understanding of the anima ecclesiastica, which is the collective genius in the communion of saints.

48 For instance, Augustine extrapolated from these biblical teachings the idea of Christ as “the I nner Teacher.” He understood this to be a manifestation of the indwelling truth of God, which illuminates the believer from the inside out. He suggested that the I nner Teacher is the presence of Christ in our inner being that guides the learner/disciple in their growth into maturity and Christlikeness. We can and must learn from, respond to, and actively rely on this presence. The Quakers chose to call this “the inner light,” made available through the indwelling presence of God in the life of the believer. It is this mutual indwelling, this inner communion, that enables some form of ongoing internal dialogue with Jesus as our guide and teacher. (See Von Balthasar, Prayer, 63.) This in turn means that “prayer and worship are indispensable to the inner act of reason” because there is no other way in which we could sense and respond to this I nner Teacher or make sense of what he is saying. In describing this form of knowledge of God—and the role of prayer and reverence in accessing what he calls “the ineffable”—Heschel says, “It is not in a roundabout way, by analogy or inference, that we become aware of the ineffable; we do not think about it in absentia. It is rather sensed as something immediately given by way of an insight that is unending and underivable, logically and psychologically prior to judgment, to the assimilation of subject matter to mental categories; a universal insight into an objective aspect of reality, of which all men are at all times capable; not the froth of ignorance but the climax of thought, indigenous to the climate that prevails at the summit of intellectual endeavor, where such works as the last quartets of Beethoven come into being. It is a cognitive insight, since the awareness it evokes is a definite addition to the mind.” Abraham Heschel, Man is Not Alone, 29. For an exploration of Augustinian epistemology and the idea of the I nner Teacher, see the article by Tapio Puolimatka, “Augustine and education in critical thinking,” Journal of Beliefs & Values, Studies in Religion & Education, Volume 26, 2005, I ssue 2, https://www. tandfonline. com/doi/figure/10.1080/13617670500164924? scroll=top&need Access=true&role=tab.

52 “It makes a great difference to the act of contemplation whether I see myself as an isolated subject, who, albeit assisted by God’s grace, endeavors to understand something of the mysteries of revelation; or whether, in faith, I have the conviction that my inadequate attempt to understand is supported by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit dwelling within me, that my acts of worship, petition and thanksgiving are borne along and remodeled by the Spirit’s infinite and eternal acts, in that ineffable union by which all human doing and being has been lifted up and plunged into the river of eternal life and love.” Von Balthasar, Prayer, 76.

53 Spiritual instinct is also an important aspect of APEST, which is part of the latent intelligences and capacities inherent in the body of Christ. See Hirsch, 5Q. Perhaps another way of thinking about this body-instinct is through the traditional teaching of anima ecclesiastica (the soul of the church), which is understood as a dimension of the so-called communion of saints. I (Alan) and my colleagues have worked very hard to help the church understand the sheer power of APEST and have assessments, training, and coaching available globally.

55 Another example is what I (Alan) call “latent potential” in my book The Forgotten Ways. The name of thebook itself says it all: the potential for transformative Jesus movement always lies “latent” in all genuine expressions of discipleship (individual and collective) and that, given the right conditions, they can be activated. In other words, I believe that apostolic movements are our most instinctive and primal (and by far and away the most transformative) forms of ecclesia. This latency accounts, for example, for the fact that even though separated by thousands of years as well as by radically different cultures and worldviews, the phenomenology of the Chinese underground church movement is precisely the same as that of the early post-apostolic church movement.

13 This is why Scripture says that to have an evil heart is to be double-minded; and that to purify the heart is to become single-minded (Jas 4:8). “It is in the ‘reasonings’ of people that this futility has taken place, showing that, whatever their initial knowledge of God might be, their natural capacity to reason accurately about God is quickly and permanently harmed.

Parallel to, and descriptive of, this futility in thinking is the darkening of the ‘un-understanding heart.’ In the NT, ‘heart’ is broad in its meaning, denoting ‘the thinking, feeling, willing ego of man, with particular regard to his responsibility to God. We can understand, then, how Paul can describe the heart as being ‘without understanding’ and recognize also how comprehensive is this description of fallen humanity. At the very center of every person, where the knowledge of God, if it is to have any positive effects, must be embraced, there has settled a darkness—a darkness that only the light of the gospel can penetrate.” Moo, The Epistle to the Romans, 107. In the forming of a collective or individual mind, the notion of cognitive dissonance seems to be important. We make complex rationalizations in order to justify our actions in the world. No one does evil because it’s evil; they do it because they think it is the right or even the good thing to do. Ponder the idea of slavery for instance.

To justify slavery, the slave owner has to operate from a position that affirms slavery as not only possible, but as something that is in fact good. So much so that some people “made

a living” by hunting for slaves and selling them. There were many so-called “Christians” among these—think of Spain and Portugal, or the devout evangelical Southern states. Or apartheid South Africa. What kind of mind is the one that legitimizes and authorizes the idea of owning other human beings and doing to them as you see fit? Of dominating them totally? And slavery is only one of the possible narratives that we maintain to legitimize immoral actions. We can put all other endemic sins in here—pride, racism, sexism, greed, injustice, pornography, and patriarchy.

14 We have already noted that in Romans 12:1–2, something revolutionary has taken place at the core of a person’s consciousness, their way of perceiving the world. The believer receives a whole new worldview in the act of conversion and begins to live from within that new orientation. “Since it is the mind that is being transformed, Paul is talking about a change in worldview, a Copernican revolution in one’s thinking, not just an attitude adjustment.

He is speaking about a new or ‘renewed’ and Christlike way of looking at the world. In the light of the previous verse, Paul must surely also mean that to offer proper and rational worship one must have a renewed mind. For one thing, one’s concept of God, the one true God, must be renewed or transformed. Renewal of mind and presentation of body are two parts of what must happen if one is to offer true worship to God. But Paul also says that the renewal of the mind is the prerequisite to discerning the will of God, and so to behaving as well as believing in a way that worships and glorifies God... Discernment of what is good and pleasing and perfect in God’s will and eyes is possible only if the fallen person has had a transformation and renewal of his or her mind. Precisely because the believer is a new eschatological creation, though living in an old and obsolescent world, new modes of behavior are expected, indeed required. As Wright suggests, v.1 focuses on the body but with the mind involved, and v.2 focuses on the mind but with implications about what the body does. These two verses then together refer to the whole person dedicated to God in all things and orientations.” Ben Witherington III, Paul’s Letter to the Romans: A SocioRhetorical Commentary (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004), 287. The action of conversion is considered to be a “renewing of the mind” (Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23). In both cases the process is one whereby God takes control of the individual’s mind through the Holy Spirit and leads the thoughts of that person into proper channels. Thus, they are given power to make proper value judgments. The convert has a new mind with which to make spiritual discernments.

He or she has the mind of Christ (1 Cor 2:15–6). Thus, Paul can say that they therefore serve God with their mind (Rom 7:25).

15 Actually, the words “soul” and “spirit” both hint at the intangible quality of wind; both the Hebrew (nephesh and ruach) and Greek (psyche) words literally mean breath and living being and are synonymous with life itself. See Brown, The Dictionary of New Testament Theology, Vol. 3, 680, for a thorough lexical analysis of the terms used in Scripture.

16 The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the term “soul” refers to “the innermost aspect of persons, that which is of greatest value in them, that by which they are most especially in God’s image: ‘soul’ signifies the spiritual principle in humanity.” https://www. vatican. va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX. HTM (accessed February 28, 2023).

18 He maintains that the soul 1) makes all meaning possible, 2) turns events into personal experience, 3) involves a deepening of experience, 4) is communicated and experienced most profoundly in love, and 5) has a special relation with death, which highlights the pathos of life in the face of it. James Hillman, Re-Visioning Psychology (New York: Harper Perennial, 1977), xvi, and his Suicide and the Soul (New York: Harper Colophon 1976), 44–7. The mention of death here might be jarring, but death is significant for the soul because possibility (and hence imagination) derives from an existential recognition of our finitude: what is finite can imagine possibilities, some of which will be realized, others of which, owing to death, will not.

19 He adds “The holy Scriptures do everywhere place religion very much in the affection; things such as fear, hope, love, hatred, desire, joy, sorrow, gratitude, compassion, and zeal.

It is evidence that true religion, or holiness of heart, lies very much in the affection of the heart, that the Scriptures place the sin of the heart very much in hardness of heart … Now by a hard heart, is plainly meant an unaffected heart, or a heart not easy to be moved with virtuous affections.” Jonathan Edwards, On the Religious Affections (Carlisle, PA: Banner of Truth, 1961), 11.

20 It is fascinating that theologians believe that, before the fall, the first humans wore their souls on the outside of their bodies. In a sense they were clothed in their souls. They were “glorious” in that they literally glowed with vibrant and authentic life. This idea also accounts for the practice of portraying saints and holy people with a shining aura. They are people whose souls irradiate their bodies; they get to wear their souls on the outside. See for instance Hans Urs von Balthasar, The Christian State of Life (San Francisco: I gnatius, 1983), 97.

25 Both the Hebrew and Greek versions of Dt 6:4–5 describe a threefold response to God— heart, soul, and strength. Mark quotes Jesus adding a fourth element, the love of God with your whole mind or understanding. “Four times in Mark 9:30 the word ‘all’ is repeated, emphasizing the necessity of a total response of love to the lordship of God. God is the one and only Lord, not only of Israel but of every individual as well. God lays rightful claim to every facet of human personality: heart (affection), soul (spirit), mind (intelligence), and strength (will). Each of the four commandments is prefaced by the Greek preposition ex, meaning ‘from the source of,’ rather than ‘by means of.’ Thus, we are commanded to love God not simply with our whole heart, but from our heart.” James Edwards, The Gospel According to Mark: Pillar New Testament Commentaries (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002), 771.

26 I (Alan) have done a fair bit of work on this dimension of discipleship and worship in previous writings, namely in Untamed, 65–8 and in ReJesus, 149–159. In this book we are focusing on the aspect of wholesale and systemic change that goes to the root of things.

But we recommend exploring the material in Untamed and ReJesus to substantiate what is said here. See Alan Hirsch and Debra Hirsch, Untamed: Reactivating a Missional Form of Discipleship (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2010) and Frost and Hirsch, Re Jesus.

## NOTES

27 “The word ‘heart’ connotes what is meant today by the term ‘person’ and ‘center of the person’; From Pascal who understands ‘heart’ as the ‘sensorium for the whole, for God,’ we learn that it is in the heart that intellect, will and all the faculties have their common foundation. Thus faith, for Pascal, is defined as ‘God perceived by the heart.’ What in an older psychology is meant in Scripture by ‘heart’ was largely occupied by the will or love; but following Pascal, Peguy and others, von Balthasar goes beyond this understanding, suggesting that it is in the heart that reason and freedom, intellect and will attain their ultimate unity and integration. If one were to try to discern in von Balthasar’s aesthetics a ‘place of contact’ in the human person between natural and supernatural orders, human and divine freedom, finite and infinite, it would have to be in the heart. There the light of God, the light of faith, is received by the human person if it is received (2 Cor. 4:5); there the substance of God touches the substance of the human soul; there the human person meets the personal God. The light of God shines in a heart that is open and ready to receive it. The prerequisite of a fundamental openness and receptivity on the part of the human subject in order for perception to take place applies on both natural and supernatural levels of seeing.

This fundamental, free receptivity is the prerequisite, the precondition of all genuinely personal knowledge.” Ann M. Callahan, The Concept of Person in the Theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar (PhD diss., Fordham University, 1993), 190–1.

28 Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Way (St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 2012), 154–5. We are reminded of Paul’s exhortation in Rom 12:1–2: “By the mercies of God … present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable [logikēn] worship. Do not be conformed [mē syschēmatizesthe] to this world, but be transformed [metamorphousthe] by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God.” Douglas Harink, I and IIPeter: The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2009), 56. See appendix three on the prayer of the heart.

29 To really know God we have to love him with all three dimensions of the heart. For instance, we cannot simply love God with our minds alone. Brute facticity and cold logic remain uncompelling for the human being when they are divorced from questions of meaning, beauty, and teleology. We need to love with all our soul-power as well as all of our will-power. In other words, we need orthodoxy, orthopraxy, and orthopathy to truly know God. Orthodoxy involves right belief and is a function of the nous/mind. Orthopraxy involves right acting as a way of knowing and loving God and is a function of will. And orthopathy involves an engagement of our affections and passions and aligning them with the One God. This is, of course, an engagement of the soul. See Hirsch and Frost, Re Jesus, 143–53, and Hirsch and Hirsch, Untamed, 64–8 for a more thorough exploration of what we call a biblical epistemology, or way of knowing.

30 Willard, Renovation of the Heart, 47. That is why we have the biblical teaching that human good and evil are in the end matters of the heart. Freedom is therefore directly related to the human capacity for sin and rebellion. Response and responsibility, obedience and choice, are the basis of monotheistic religion.

31 Kay, Theological Aesthetics, 1–2. Kay goes on to say, “By rooting the senses in itself the heart makes all sensual activities into acts of the whole human. The senses are a person’s opened heart. The eye, for instance, is the openness of the whole man to reality insofar as it is form and light. This integration of the mind’s vision with the eye’s vision is effected not only by their common agent, the heart, but also by their common object, Being.” 32 Consider too that many Christians and churches go overboard on a theology of experience that fails to integrate the intellect and the will. Von Balthasar notes that “Many aberrations of the theology of experience and of life throughout history derive in every case from the fact that feeling is too exclusively thought of as an isolated act alongside the intellect and the will, and too little understood as the integration of the person’s whole life. Consequently, the criteria for the God-relationship are based too exclusively on individual emotional states and pay little attention to the event by which man’s total constitution and disposition, which are the foundation for everything else, can be experienced in and through individual emotional states. The Scriptural arguments that oppose a pure theology of feeling lie ready to hand; but the very same arguments can equally be applied to defeat a theology that would attempt to establish man’s rightful relationship to God simply on isolated acts of faith and love, instead of anchoring it within man’s total disposition towards the living God.” Von Balthasar, The Glory of the Lord, I, 237.

33 This example itself was suggested to me (Alan) by my friend Mandy Smith.

35 Ameta-idea is an idea that determines and shapes other ideas and thinking in the organization. In other words, it is what we might call a “primordial idea” or “cornerstone concept.” Change here changes everything. Identifying these is critical in leveraging change throughout the organization. For those aware of Alan’s mDNA model of movement, each of the mDNA are in effect meta-ideas. These are; Jesus is Lord (transcendent ideals that inform and motivate), Discipleship and Disciple-Making (system of recruitment and formation of adherents), Missional-Incarnational Impulse (how the organization extends and establishes itself onto new ground), APEST Culture (ministry and leadership typology and system), Organic Systems (movemental and scalable organization), and Liminality-Communitas (the capacity to take risks, innovate, and thrive in adaptive situations.) Each of these offers huge leverage throughout the organization.

36 In the church, core theology constitutes the meta-ideas that have significant scriptural weight/authority to be deemed necessary for faith.

37 Culture creates the environment where behaviors are legitimized, responsibilities are shared, and meaning and significance are transferred. This is clearly important because it involves reinforcing the motivational passions that keep people aligned to the communal cause. See Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways, 202.

3 “History amply shows, we prefer regularity and predictability and want to forgo the perils of adventure in exchange for a more manageable experience of life, especially in institutions.

Here, at least in part, lies the psychology behind institutionalism: all institutions, religious or otherwise, are designed to provide the safety of predictability achieved through ritual, dogma, and control through regulations, policies, the promise of reward, or the threat of discipline. That is not necessarily a bad thing. In many ways, this is the boon that institutions confer on us: by providing regularity, recognizability, and ritual, they relieve us of having to incessantly develop new ways of doing things.” Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim, The Permanent Revolution: Apostolic Imagination and Practice for the 21st Century Church (San Francisco: Wiley, 2012), 185.

6 The U-shaped journey is variously expressed in the New Testament in the doctrines of Christ’s self-emptying (kenosis), the incarnation, recapitulation (anakephalaiosis), restoration of all things (apocatastasis), suffering (pathos) and the process of making divine through union with God (theosis).

9 Liminality is the quality of danger, disorientation, marginalizing, or threat that precipitates a learning journey. It means a threshold experience, in which we stand on the threshold or a transitional boundary.

10 Perhaps you should put yourself into the story where Jesus sends his apostles to do a liminal task: “And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal. And he said to them, ‘Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.’ And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere” (Lk 6–9:1 RSV).

2 Eddie Gibbs, himself one of the founders of church growth theory, once quipped that what emerged from all the management and marketing techniques applied to the church: “Oh, it’s a pig with lipstick, but it’s still a pig.” He, of course, meant that the fundamental paradigm of (attractional) church remained intact.

3 In his brilliant book on the nature of prophetic consciousness, Abraham Heschel says that we must forget many clichés if we want to understand things in a new way. “I nsight is a breakthrough, requiring much intellectual dismantling and dislocation. It begins with a mental interim, with the cultivation of a feeling for the unfamiliar, unparalleled, incredible. It is in being involved with a phenomenon, being intimately engaged to it, courting it, as it were, that after much perplexity and embarrassment we come upon insight—upon a way of seeing the phenomenon from within. I nsight is accompanied by a sense of surprise. What has been closed is suddenly disclosed. It entails genuine perception, seeing anew. He who thinks that we can see the same object twice has never seen. Paradoxically, insight is knowledge at first sight.” Abraham Heschel, The Prophets, Vol. 1 (New York: Harper Perennial, 1962), xxiv–v.

5 Peter Drucker notes that all living organisms must have a functioning system of elimination, or they will soon perish. He suggests therefore that a foundational principle for an adaptive organization is to “abandon yesterday” in order to free resources from being committed to maintaining what no longer contributes to performance, and no longer produces results. He suggests that “The first policy, therefore, throughout the entire institution, has to be Organized Abandonment.” Peter F.

In fact, it was the seminal philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn, who noted that new paradigms begin when the very best theorists in their respective fields sense the anomalies in the prevailing paradigm—that the mental constructs of the predominant paradigm do not account for all aspects of reality—there are flaws at the core of the model. The anomaly initiates the unraveling of the system. It initiates the search for alternatives. Kuhn notes that the new paradigm begins to form when these people get together and begin to compare notes and collectively name the problem

13 An object that has one singular function for an adult (e. g., a chair) has many playful possibilities for the child. For an adult, it is “just a chair” whereas for the child it can be a house, a horse, an anti-aircraft gun, etc. This is also called “divergent thinking” by creativity experts—a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. The alternative to divergent thinking is convergent thinking, which is more focused, systematic, and linear, arriving at one solution. Divergent thinking is non-linear logic that expands outwards by generating multiple ideas and using familiar materials in unfamiliar ways.

19 Thankfully not all members of the organization need to be involved at all stages of this process. We suggest that those working at the level of paradigm and mental mapping ought to bring key leaders (around 5 percent of people) into this process early as they are, in effect, the keepers of the paradigm. If they do not change then neither will the system. Broader leadership (around 15 percent) needs to be engaged in the culture-creation aspects of the platform. By the time we get to practices, everyone in the organization (the remaining 80 percent) becomes involved because everyone is affected.

20 This correlation between the design process and the movement that emerges from it is like a seed, which contains in itself the potential for a whole forest. The seed, is of course the paradigm and the DNA that provides the seminal code for what follows. However, if the seed is to not just survive but to thrive, it must germinate, take root, and develop into a tree.

By doing this it creates a viable organism, which is the living expression of the potential life contained in the seed (platform). From there, the individual tree, if it is healthy and operates according to its inbuilt purpose, must go on to produce fruit in which the potential for the whole forest is contained (practices). But it is correct to say that the potential for the forest was already contained in the seed.

Very often, we are not consciously aware of our own paradigms or the effects they have on our behavior. He notes that in the world of commerce, “many insights into new markets or outmoded organizational practices fail to get put into practice because they conflict with powerful, tacit mental models.” Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization (New York: Currency Doubleday, 1990), 11.

2 As we were writing this book, we heard Lucas Pulley, a friend and colleague of ours from the amazing Tampa Underground Network share: “We often rely solely on communication (our words) to shift a community or organization in a new direction. Those words are no match for a decades-formed culture and structure hell-bent on preventing any change. This dynamic is what’s happening when megachurches do a sermon series on microchurch or on releasing the priesthood of all believers.” We could not agree more with Lucas. Preachers, take note!

5 Ahelpful exercise in diagnosing the misalignment between culture and structure is to write your “systems story.” You do this by asking and answering the question, What story is your system telling? (See appendix eight for instructions.) 6 See Geoffrey G. Parker, Marshall W.

9 One of the remarkable, and often-overlooked, dimensions of New Testament ecclesiology is that Jesus has given us everything we need to get the job done. One of the ways that this is factored into the agency of the church is in the area of the APEST typology of Ephesians 4:1–16 which I (Alan) typology of ministry and leadership is as good as any that can be found in best thinking from leadership and organizational studies. All the functions of ministry and organization are covered in this system from the missional/entrepreneurial (apostolic); the aligning function (prophetic); the capacity to recruit and get buy-in (evangelistic); to the human resourcing functions that are key to the functions of the shepherd and the teacher. The remarkable thing is that this is not just a leadership capacity but is “given” to all believers (“to each one of us,” Eph 4:7) thus distributing a particular agency and function to all.

10 Not to mention, volunteerism is in massive decline in our culture. Most pastors or church leaders can verify this. Because the church in the West is in such steep decline, local churches are struggling to get people to fill volunteer roles—this alone should force us to examine our missional structures.

12 Quoted in Gil Bailie, Violence Unveiled: Humanity at the Crossroads (New York: The Crossroad Publishing, 1997), xv.

13 In his book, The New Leadership Literacies, Bob Johansen, shares that to thrive in times of extreme disruption, will require organizations to shapeshift from centralized to decentralized structures. In doing so, he emphasizes the necessity of distributing authority in and through their new decentralized form, ensuring each leader be given the authority needed to accomplish the role they have responsibility for (New Leadership Literacies: Thriving in a Future of Extreme Disruption and Distributed Everything [Barrett-Koehler Publishers, 2017], chapter 6). Also we refer you to Wegner, Ford, and Hirsch, The Starfish and the Spirit for a thorough exploration of “starfish” principles for movements.

14 We use the word democratize, not in its political sense but in its literal sense: to push out through all the people of the organization.

15 The move from centralization to democratization is a dynamic tension that can be seen in the Scriptures. Humankind’s constant default is the elevation of self versus God’s desire to democratize his Spirit and mission through all people. This tension is clear when juxtaposing the Tower of Babel narrative in Genesis 11 with Pentecost in Acts 2. In Babel, we see people building a tower up to God, and God confuses the languages, leading to humankind being scattered and divided; whereas, at Pentecost, God comes down to us, we are given the Holy Spirit, the gospel is unleashed around the world, and the many ethnicities present experience a miraculous unity.

16 This is why the mDNA of Organic Systems becomes an essential platform design principle.

Another massive benefit of this structure is how it combats the hyper-individualism of our world. Organic systems, held together by common DNA, create a foundation for a deeper experience of authentic community, reflecting another mDNA element of Liminality and Communitas.

17 Healthy, networked organizations not only reflect Jesus’ design for how the church should interact with itself but actually reflect the nature of the God we worship; the God in whose

## NOTES

image we have been created; the God in whom we have been united to in Christ; one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Many of the central characteristics of organic networks are Trinitarian (perichoretic) by nature: love, unity in diversity, mutual submission, common purpose, and the like.

3 James K. A. Smith, says, “What if, instead of starting from the assumption that human beings are thinking things, we started from the conviction that human beings are first and foremost lovers? What if you are defined not by what you know but by what you desire?

What if the center of and seat of the human person is found not in the heady regions of the intellect but in the gut-level regions of the heart? How would that change our approach to discipleship and Christian formation?” James K. A. Smith, You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit (Grand Rapids: Brazos Press, 2016), 7.

4 An example of a fractalized meta-idea is in what is often called Up-In-Out which refers to the three dimensions of biblical spirituality—upward toward God, inward toward community/people, and outward in mission in the world. This fractal can be applied at the level of the individual disciple all the way to the largest gathering. See chapter seven of this book to recall the definition and significance of fractals for viable expressions of movement.

6 Our practices don’t arise in a vacuum; they are outward and visible expressions of what we think are important. They are formulated out of what we believe and are given their true meaning and significance from the way we perceive the world and our place within it. In other words, our practices are both expressions of our paradigm/s and embodiments of our culture.

7 The Golden Rule of Habit Change expresses the most effective way to stop addictive habits and replaces them with new ones. It states that if you keep the initial cue, replace the routine, and keep the reward, change will eventually occur, although individuals who do not believe in what they are doing will likely fall short of the expectations and give up. See Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business (New York: Random House, 2012).

8 Performing an action repeatedly activates neurons in certain parts of the brain, particularly the cerebellum and basal ganglia, and creates a new neural pathway between the central nervous system and the muscles you’re moving. Muscle memory is a form of procedural memory that involves consolidating a specific motor task into memory through repetition, which has been used synonymously with motor learning. When a movement is repeated over time, the brain creates a long-term muscle memory for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed with little to no conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. Muscle memory is found in many everyday activities that become automatic and improve with practice, such as riding bicycles, driving motor vehicles, playing ball sports, typing on keyboards, entering PINs, playing musical instruments, throwing a ball, martial arts, and dancing.

11 Although the process of designing a unique organizational algorithm is beyond the scope of this book, we address the topic to emphasize the power of algorithms and to encourage organizational leaders to develop an algorithm. We have been highly influenced by the best of design thinking on the subject. Resources such as Stanford D.

The author goes on to write: “The Trinity is, so, an eternal dance of the Father, Son, and Spirit sharing mutual love, honor, happiness, joy, and respect, and living an eternal relationship of self-giving. In this dance, the three divine persons of the One God have loved one another and been in a relationship with one another for all eternity. They, also, deeply and intimately know one another and there is no fear, shame, or insecurity in their knowledge of one another. Father and Son dwell in a face-to-face relationship with the Spirit as the bond of love that unites them. The profoundly complete and pure relationship and free, full, and overflowing love is the central quality of God.

Through this never-ending dance, the divine persons exist so intimately with one another, for one another, and in one another, that they constitute a single, unique, and complete unity by themselves.”

## NOTES

  Conclusion: Write Your Own Adventure

1 One of the best “formulas” to emerge from the Reformation was semper reformanda, which maintains that the church cannot rest on its current formulations and expressions; that we never arrive at the perfected form of ecclesia; that we must always be re-form-ing. This commits the church to constant adaptation—something we have all-too-seldom done, despite it being formulated over five hundred years ago. Most denominational expressions are deeply entrenched in now outdated paradigms and formulations.

  2 Willem Vanderburg says, “Western culture tells us we should be complete and independent.

It tempts us to believe we can escape our ordinary, human limitations—weakness, sickness, incapacity, ignorance. We swim in water that is toxic to humans. The more we bring that toxic culture into our Christian practices, the more we strip our faith of every way God wants to redeem us as ordinary, limited humans.” Quoted in Mandy Smith, Unfettered: Imagining a Childlike Faith beyond the Baggage of Western Culture (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2021), 17.

3 For instance, “But just as love is not overcome by the everyday routine, but uses its imagination in a thousand ways to transfigure it, fashioning each day anew in small details, so it is with contemplation. Every day I am privileged to appear before the God who is eternally young, who never ages; God’s meadows bloom as brightly and in as many colors as ever, and man’s inner receptivity is renewed every day, provided that he makes use of it. His tiredness, listlessness, discouragement and bitterness are his alone, and he cannot complain about anything, since God has everything ready to refresh him, bowed down as he is under his burdens. He only has to pull himself together and shake off whatever is oppressing him and dragging him down. All he has to do is give it over and begin again.” Von Balthasar, Prayer, 139.
