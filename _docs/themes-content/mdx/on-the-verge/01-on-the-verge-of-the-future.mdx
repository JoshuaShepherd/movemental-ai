The fact that this book is the defining document of the Exponential 2011: On the Verge conference, the largest gathering of church planters and pioneering church practitioners in the Western world, is very significant because for the first time, the frontier idea of missional movement is being main-staged. But when one considers that this conference is primarily oriented toward attractional and church-growth-oriented gatherings in North America, it further demonstrates

But this isn’t about big-staged events and theoretical writing: this book represents an effort by Alan and Dave to articulate a dynamic learning journey called Future Travelers. Future Travelers is a twoyear learning cohort initially composed of twelve megachurches (representing more than eighty thousand people) committed to seriously factoring missional movements into their current equation of church.

For many of these churches, this journey is not just tinkering on the side; it involves a major commitment to somehow reframe their relative churches as high-impact, exponentially reproducing, missional movements. In many ways, these pioneering churches represent the widespread interest, in evangelical church circles, in becoming more genuinely missional in approach. Because of these reasons, Future Travelers will provide a window into the future of the church in the West. In many ways, we will be weaving this book around the stories, experiments, learnings, and best practices of the innovative, frontline churches in this forum.

We feel very excited about what God is doing in the church at this time. And while we’re fully aware the movement is in the early stages of the life cycle, we believe there’s a certain inevitability about what is happening. According to the sociology of ideas and theory of tipping points, all that is needed for an idea to become an inevitable reality within any given population (in our case, American evangelicalism) is for significant adoption by the first 16 percent of that population.2 This is because the first to adopt represent the innovators and early adopters and therefore represent the progressive, future-oriented, and creative side in that population sample. We believe there is now a growing momentum, and if we haven't already passed the tipping point, it will happen sometime soon.

### Introducing the Future Travelers

We will be telling the stories of some of the following churches throughout the text and have included profiles of each church in the appendix of thebook. Each church profile contains demographic information about the church, their story, as well as some of the wins and challenges they have faced.

- The Austin Stone Church — Austin, Texas
- Community Christian Church — Chicago, Illinois
- Granger Community Church — Granger, Indiana
- The Journey — St. Louis, Missouri
- Kensington Community Church — Detroit, Michigan
- Mosaic Church — Little Rock, Arkansas
- Mountain Lake — Cumming, Georgia
- River Tree Christian Church — Massillon, Ohio
- Rock Harbor Church — Costa Mesa, California
- Seacoast Church — Charleston, South Carolina
- Soma Communities — Seattle-Tacoma, Washington
- West Ridge Church — Dallas, Georgia

We are bold enough to say that adoption by the more vigorous and authentic sectors of evangelical Christianity is just a matter of time. And while, at the time of writing, we acknowledge there are few mature expressions of apostolic movements in America, the paradigm of missional church is receiving a growing acceptance by our best leaders and most progressive thinkers.

This is why we call this book On the Verge and the churches are described as “Verge churches.” There will be times when we use the more technical and somewhat descriptive phrase “apostolic movements” to describe what we are on the verge of seeing here in the West.

Whatever terminology we might employ, we do believe we’re on the threshold of something that has profound significance for the future of Western, and therefore global, Christianity. What were once conflicting approaches to church (such as incarnational or attractional) are beginning to seriously interact. Each informs the other, and it’s only now becoming clear what is emerging. Because of this intermingling of diverse and energetic idea-spaces — missional theology, new church practices, glocal cultural shifts, and breakthrough technologies — a new paradigm is emerging. Our idea or conception of church is being changed as we speak. This doesn’t happen very often in the life of the church (see table on pp. 34–38), but when it does, it fundamentally alters the nature of the game.

And because it’s the missional God (initiator of the Missio Dei) who’s most invested in the church becoming missional, we have cause for great hope. And because it’s the Holy Spirit who moves and shapes the church, equipping us to fulfill our purposes as God’s people, this is not simply something ideological; in fact, it goes to the heartbeat and the very purposes of God’s people in the world. In other words, we are on the verge of something very significant in the life of the church in the West. This book is dedicated to the articulation, the development, and hopefully the eventual triumph of what God is doing in and through his church.

### Catalysts for Ecclesiological Shift

#### Cultural Shifts

The cultural shifting we speak of relates not so much to the overhyped rise of postmodernism alone but rather to the emergence of various large-scale cultural forces in the twenty-first century: globalization, climate change, technological breakthroughs, International terrorism, geopolitical shifts, economic crises, the digitalization of information, social networks, the rise of bottom-up people-movements, the rise of new religious movements, even the New Atheism, and others. These all conspire together to further accelerate the marginalization of the church as we know it, forcing us to rethink our previously privileged relationship to broader culture around us.

The logic of Western civilization is the increasing secularization, or at least increasing de-churching, of society as ushered in by the French Revolution. This in effect means the Europeanization of Western culture. While there are factors in American culture that work against the radical secularization of culture, the encroachment of European-style de-churching is clearly evident in the cities and population centers of the northeastern United States (for example, New York, Washington, D. C., Boston) as well as the northwest (for example, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle). However one might conceive it, there is no doubting that Christianity, as a vital religious force, is on the wane in every Western context. Many in the U.S. are just beginning to feel this, but thankfully many are also beginning to respond. On the Verge is one such response.

## Multicultural Shifts

One of the biggest cultural shifts of our time is the increasingly multicultural nature of the West. The brute fact is that most of the evangelical church leaders who will read this book will be white, suburban, and middle-class, and the equally stark reality is that within decades, Anglo-Saxon Americans will be in the minority in the U.S. — yet our churches don’t seem to be responding to this reality.

In fact, the old adage that the most segregated hour in America is on Sunday mornings still holds truth. Not only is multiculturalism a missional challenge, but it’s also a challenge to our ecclesiology, the doctrine of the church as Jesus designed it to be. It’s going to take a lot of thinking, loving, and reaching out to correct this imbalance in the people of God.3

## Engaging the 60:40 — The Blue and Red Oceans

The Future Travelers conversation was catalyzed, in part, by the probing of questions raised by the changing role and appeal of the church in Western society. Until recent years, the church — especially in the Christendom period — retained a very significant cultural connection with the prevailing society around it. In other words, most people were within the cultural orbit of the church and open to being influenced by the ideas that energized the church. However, this has definitely begun to shift in the last fifty years.

It is our opinion, and that of the Future Travelers group, that the prevailing, contemporary church-growth approach to church will have significant cultural appeal — marketability, if you will — to about 40 percent of the American population. (This is informed opinion, anecdotal in nature because to date there is no hard research on this.) This is not attendance; we know that attendance in these forms of churches is far less than that. This means that the prevailing models of evangelistic churches could likely max out at around 40 percent of the population, perhaps 50 percent at the very best.4 However we cut it, it leaves us with two major problems.

## Strategic Problem

The first one is a strategic problem. Most of our churches believe and act as if modeling on (and perfecting) the successful contemporary church approach will resolve their problems of mission. But even if they could all become successful megachurches, the vast majority of churches cannot and should not. The financial capital, managerial infrastructure, leadership ability, communication strategies, and amount of artistic talent are huge in megachurches — all making for a model that is not very reproducible.

So we have a vexing situation where probably 90 percent or more of evangelical churches in America (and other Western contexts) are aiming at becoming a model that not only is improbable for the vast majority but also (even if they could crack the codes) effectively would still just be competing with other churches for the same 40 percent.5 This should concern us very deeply. Anyone with a sense of strategy should be immediately alert at this point.

Why? Because all our missional eggs are in one ecclesiological basket! We have no diversity of options — most of our current practices are simply variations of the same model. This is not to say it’s wrong or not used by God, and so on. Please don’t hear us wrong here. Clearly, God uses the contemporary church. It is simply to say it is not sufficient to the increasingly missional challenge now set before us.

It was psychologist Abraham Maslow who noted that when the only tool you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail.

The tool itself begins to define us and determine our approaches.

However, if we are going to rise to the situation we face, we are going to need more tools.

More disturbing, perhaps, is that this dearth of options demonstrates a serious poverty of imagination in the way we think about the church and mission and indicates why we desperately need to innovate.

## Missionary Problem

If the first problem is a strategic one highlighting the need for genuine ecclesiological innovation and a diversity of approaches, the second one is a very serious missionary problem taking us to the core purposes of the church Jesus built. This problem is perhaps the most important question facing us in relation to the long-term viability of Christianity in Western contexts. As Jesus’ sent people, we have to ask ourselves, what about the possible 60 percent of people who for various reasons report significant alienation from precisely the contemporary church-growth model(s) we rely so heavily on? What will church be for these people? What is good news going to sound like for them?

And how are they going to access the gospel of Jesus in ways that are culturally meaningful for them?

The reality is, if we expect more variations of the prevailing practices to reach into increasingly de-churched and unchurched populations, we are fooling ourselves. We’re avoiding the missionary call of the church to take Christ’s message to the people and nations.

In many ways, our situation is experienced in the broader world of business strategy and global markets. Leading strategists Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne use the vivid metaphor of red and blue oceans to describe the situation.6 The red oceans concept is used to describe all the industries in existence at any given point — the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of product or ser vice demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities or niche, and cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody. Hence the term red ocean — the sharks battle it out with each other for survival.

Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today — the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. There is no frenzied feeding, and so little competition. Blue ocean describes the wider, deeper potential of spiritual idea-space that is not yet explored.

Kim and Mauborgne suggest that the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy is value innovation — that is, the creation of innovative new markets to unlock new demand. According to the authors, organizations must learn how to create uncontested market space by reconstructing market boundaries, focusing on the big picture, reaching beyond existing demand, and getting the strategic sequence right.

To illustrate this point, Rob Wegner of Granger Community Church (GCC) recently told us that back in the early days of GCC (late eighties to midnineties), they were literally the only contemporary church in their community. Nobody was doing what they were doing in the region. It was unique; it was a breakthrough. They had created the buzz and set the tone. He says, Friends would tell friends, “You’ve got to check this out. This is not like any church you’ve ever seen.” But nowadays there are a number of churches in this community doing contemporary church, and they serve with excellence. It is not unique anymore.... Before, we were the only church reaching the 40 percent; now we have a whole slew of churches in our community trying to reach that 40 percent. I’m excited about that. I even think our presence helped facilitate the growth of contemporary church in our community. But it’s definitely a red ocean scenario.7 This is exactly the issue we face. We are all competing in the red waters of the 40 percent while the 60 percent remains largely untouched. It’s time for some value innovation. Christian churches with a strong sense of missionary calling — while maintaining best practices in what they do — will also venture out to innovate new forms of church in the vast uncharted territories of the unchurched populations of our day. To do less is to fail in our missionary calling.

## More of the Same?

It was Einstein who said that the problems of the world couldn’t be resolved by the same kind of thinking that created them in the first place. And he’s right, of course — we do well to take note! The popular application of this maxim comes to us in the form of what has become known as the definition of organizational insanity: trying to achieve significantly different results by doing the same thing over and over. In other words, what got us here won’t get us there if “there” is missional movements in the West. Perhaps a more visual way of saying this is that we cannot dig a hole over there by digging this hole deeper — and yet that is what we seem to do most of the time.

The combination of strategic and missional problems creates more than enough anomalies to precipitate a major paradigm shift in the way we do and be church. But other reasons also have caused us to move toward more missional forms of church, namely that of apostolic movement.

## The Technology of Movement

We should never doubt the power that technologies possess to seriously alter social patterns and fundamentally change the way we think and act. If futurist Rex Miller is right when he said the printing press ushered in the modern world and the Reformation/Protestant churches, and the radio ushered in the broadcast era that gave birth to the church-growth paradigm, then the digital revolution will also inevitably change the way we go about being God’s people.8 The digital era — with the internet, social media, smartphone accessibility, and so on — has the effect of democratizing knowledge and radically altering the way we think and act. The new disruptive technology is having a massive reciprocal effect on social patterns across the world. Books like Here Comes Everybody, Linked, Wikinomics, The Wisdom of Crowds, Tribes, The Tipping Point, The Rise of the Chaordic Era, Outliers, Smart World, and so on, are among countless others describing the profound, unalterable revolution that is literally redesigning the world we live in.9 And like it or not, technology — particularly information technology — is changing the church.10 For one, it breaks the hold that singular, centralized institutions have had on power and knowledge.

It also opens people to spiritual influence from diverse sources, rather than keeping them dependent on a priestly system to mediate information about God. The new digital democracy that technology ushers in is also realigning the way we organize ourselves. Things are getting more fluid, less centralized, more interpersonal. We celebrate this as an opportunity, because in many ways it puts us much closer to the radical, people-oriented movement of the New Testament church: the priesthood of all believers and the ordination of ordinary people.

The digital era, with the associated network thinking and acting, sets us up to experience movement again in a significant way.

That doesn’t happen often in the history of the church, as we shall see below. It’s a huge opportunity to recalibrate back to our most primal and potent form: the apostolic movement.

## Dethroning Constantine

Adopting a Verge church paradigm requires learning what it means to become a more fluid, adaptive, reproducible, viral people-movement.

In other words, it means taking seriously the idea that the church Jesus built — and therefore what he intended — is meant to be more of a movement than a religious institution. The New Testament church is movemental to the core, and — following Jesus’ prophetic critique of religious systems — it is inherently critical of highly institutionalized religion.

Christianity is designed to be a people’s liberation movement, a social force, a viral idea passing from person to person through the medium of gospel and discipleship, creating gospel communities in its wake. And yet, by all accounts, most churches can be described as primarily institutional in form and nature. That is, they are conceived (by insiders and outsiders alike) as being made up of buildings, programming, creeds, rituals, denominational templates and formulas, symbols, clergy and religious professionals, and so on. Now, these things aren’t necessarily wrong, but we must not confuse this with New Testament ecclesiology.

In other words, most of us mistake the forms, theology, and models of church for the church itself. We know intellectually that the church isn’t a building but a people, but our language and actions betray what we really think. That’s why we can talk about “going to church” or “getting married in the church” or “the Presbyterian church,” and so on. We understand the word church in the context of its formal structures and institutions, rather than as dynamically located in the people (laos) of God. And while clearly God permits (and human societies need) structure and some level of institution, this is definitely not what the Bible means when it talks about ecclesia, which is the main biblical term and dynamic of church.

Actually, this institutionalization of our way of thinking and doing church stems mainly from the period when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Even though immediately prior to the Edict of Milan, the church was developing forms, theology, ritual, and structure, when Constantine co-opted Christianity, he fundamentally altered the way we saw and experienced ourselves as God’s people.

What was largely an illegal, underground people-movement was now given money, status, power, and legitimacy. Everything changed.

The previously subversive Jesus movement of the early church was now given magnificent buildings at the epicenters of towns and cities, was pressed by the emperor to standardize its theology and formulate creeds and to develop a formalized clergy caste to guard and maintain the affairs of the church. The emperor Constantine became the Pontifex Maximus, a title later given to the popes. The deal was that the church became the religious and cultural center of the Roman Empire — a pretty enticing bargain, but one that fundamentally changed our ecclesiology. This was a radical shift, and we’ve never escaped it. Constantine is still the emperor of our imaginations, of the way we see and experience ourselves as church, seventeen centuries later.

## The Splinter in the Mind

The past 1700 years of church history following Constantine have furthered the shift from more movemental forms to more institutional ones. The challenge of our day is to recover the movement form again.

This has occurred in history, and when it has, it has almost always gone viral and made a massive impact: the early church, the Celtic movement, the Waldensians, the Franciscans, Moravians, Wesleyan revivals, early Pentecostalism, the Chinese underground church, the I ndian people-movements, Latin-American Christianity, to name but a few.

In order to understand these shifts and recover the more apostolic forms of movement, we’ve adopted terminology that portrays the key paradigm of each period. Here are some working definitions we will use:

- Grassroots: The church as a bottom-up movement; a phenomenon involving ordinary people, with very little structure or involvement from official institutions.

- Missional: The church seeing itself as the primary means to transfer God's redemptive message to the world.

- Movemental: The church as a more fluid structure; a social force traveling like a virus from one person to another, with leadership who lead from the front.

- Structural: The church as a movement at the beginning stages of cultural organization in order to give direction and focus. As the church gets a little more organized, it isn't necessarily rigid — the organization is more adaptive and functional at this stage.

- I nstitutional: The church as primarily existing in the forms, organization, liturgies, traditions, plant and resources, programs, clergy, and so on.

- Hierarchical: The church as a power system holding leadership

and organizational structures together; where elements at lower levels are submissive to elements at higher levels.

So with these in mind, consider the following table.

## Ecclesial Shifts and Paradigms

- Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms

New Testament church (AD 33 – 80) Grassroots, The NT church was a transformational, crossmissional, cultural people-movement, initiated by and movemental gathered around Jesus, engaging discipleship, worship, and mission in everyday contexts. All classes and peoples (including women and slaves) were incorporated. It was genuinely grassroots. Translocal dimensions were maintained primarily through the apostolic and prophetic ministries. Even though forms were beginning to emerge, the structure remained very fluid, contextual, organic, and adaptive.

Early church (AD 100 – 300) Missional, As a persecuted movement, the early church movemental, retained much of the earlier ethos of the NT grassroots, church and was never allowed to become an structural institution, but certainly (over time) thinking and practice began to define and shape the prevailing idea of ecclesia in an increasingly more structural manner. Persecution necessitated a more adaptive, minimalist, organic structure.

- Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms

Catholic Christendom church (AD 320 – I nstitutional, With the formal marriage of church and state, present) hierarchical Christendom was born. Within decades, the movemental aspect was almost entirely ejected from the prevailing paradigm of church. From here on, it only expresses itself in protest and renewal movements within the rigid ecclesial uniformity of Catholicism. The genius of the Catholic institution would be to eventually stifle or co-opt protest and absorb the insights of renewal movement into its system without fundamentally changing the institution.

Reformational/Protestant Christendom churches (1600 – I nstitutional, Because the Reformation was basically a Present) structural, theological feud within the European church hierarchical family (so to speak), the prevailing Christendom paradigm of church was never fundamentally challenged except by the so-called radical Reformers whose expressions of church were quickly marginalized, co-opted, or silenced.

Even though the structures of the various Reformation churches were flattened and democratized, they remained primarily hierarchical and institutional.

Historical renewal movements (sporadically Grassroots, These have taken place through history, startdispersed movemental, ing with early monastic movements through to throughout structural charismatic renewal in late twentieth century. history) Basically all/most renewal movements involve a recovery of some elements of movements, such as the priesthood of all believers, the “kingdom of God” over “church,” prophetic protest, church planting, mission on the fringes and among the poor, etc. (e. g., Celtic Christianity, Anabaptist variations, Moravians, early Methodism, early Pentecostalism, Third Wave). In most cases, they have also eventually absorbed into the mainstream. They have ushered in renewals in ecclesiology but failed to permanently dislodge the institutional paradigm. continued...

- Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms

Contemporary church-growth churches (1970s – I nstitutional, Church growth was a movement that basically present) structural, (re)organized the church around the evanhierarchical gelistic function. For so long the church had either forgotten this call or had outsourced evangelism to parachurches and other mission agencies. However, this paradigm basically accepted the institutional view of the church and added managerial, sociological, and marketing approaches to create the megachurch.

As such, it remains highly institutional even as it reframes itself in a more contemporary manner. This is strange, because the initial founder, missiologist Donald Mc Gavran, was a movement thinker, while later theorists (Win Arn, C. Peter Wagner) were more technical, managerial, sociological, and marketing people — which allowed the movement to lean into technocracy.

Missional-incarnational churches (mid-twentieth Grassroots, Arising in the middle to late twentieth century, century – missional, the missional paradigm (which places mission present) movemental as the organizing principle of church) begins to completely reframe ecclesiology around missiology. When missional ideas are informed by incarnational approaches, a distinctly grassroots perspective of the church is birthed.

But in many cases these lack organization and structure and therefore are problematic to maintain over periods of time. Transformative movements do require a vision and translocal structure, which the grassroots movement resists. On the other hand, when missional ideas fail to embrace incarnational approach together with a movement ethos, it tends to become a rather boring technical theological discussion mainly in mainline Protestant Christianity, which is very institutional and lacks the theological funding and energy to be able to produce missional movement.

- Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms

Multisite megachurches (2000 – Structural, Essentially, this was the logical extension of present) movemental the successful megachurch movement of the eighties and nineties that was birthed in the evangelistically driven church-growth movement. The idea of multisites was motivated largely by the desire to extend the megachurch’s impact and maximize on resources through developing a regional approach to church. As such, it’s a more institutional, somewhat inorganic and top-down attempt to reproduce churches. What it misses is the dynamic of bottom-up people-movements.

But because multisite thinking involved the desire to reproduce churches, its key practitioners began to probe the missional math of multiplication. They are already committed to multiplication; the logic leads them to people-movements.

Reproducing churches, church-planting movements (CPMs) (1990 – present) Movemental, Here is where the prevailing, more strucstructural tural model of the multisites really begins to think and act movementally. Church planting becomes a major thrust, but it still tends to reproduce more institutional forms. Most church planting here is simply an attempt to reproduce the contemporary megachurch model.

At this stage, it has yet to seriously engage incarnational-mission ideas. But the desire for exponential viral growth begs the question of reproducibility and what we call movementum.

To become truly exponential, churches have to significantly de-professionalize the ministry, simplify ecclesiology, and activate the whole people of God. continued...

> Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms Apostolic movements/Verge churches (2000 – Movemental, Verge churches are essentially reproducing present) missional, churches that are now beginning to reframe structural, church around the missional/apostolic function grassroots (not just evangelistic) and are beginning to restructure and organize toward exponential movement. Even grassroots dimensions are being factored into the equation as churches seek to empower all believers as agents of the King. Verge church thinks and acts like a translocal/regional movement. Micro and macro forms of church are employed in the process. The big difference between this and the missional-incarnational is that, true to its inclusive both/and approach, it’s much more organized and includes hybrid forms of organization.

At the risk of oversimplifying what we have said above, we can say that the paradigm, or systems story, of the vast majority of churches in the West (contemporary and/or historical) has been primarily an institutional one. In Verge church thinking, we must recognize it’s precisely this central paradigm that must be dislodged if we are going to become a viral gospel movement in our day. It is our belief that it’s the overwhelming predominance of the institutional imagination — the Constantinian captivity of the church, so to speak — that is keeping us from becoming genuinely missional as well as exponential. We can picture it as in figures 1 and 2.

## Verging the Church: Key Themes

The idea of pivotal design is where something that is invented or designed becomes the base design in all subsequent technologies.

For instance, the airfoil designed by the Wright brothers is still the base design in all aircraft. The transistor is another example. Or even closer to the idea of movements, the Twelve-Step program; many different interpretations and applications, but the principles remain the same. All further developments build off the base one. We believe that Verge churches — or what we hope will become apostolic movements — might well provide us with one of the pivotal designs for the church in the twenty-first century and beyond.11 But in order to comprehend and apply the “new technology” of apostolic movements, we are going to have to do a lot of reframing our thinking and practice. Throughout thebook, the reader will find we are moving from more distinctly conceptual material to that which is more concrete and practical. There is simply no way around having to do the conceptual spadework; if we wish to birth apostolic movements in our day, we cannot avoid the intellectual rigor of rethinking the paradigm, recalibrating the system, changing the metaphor, and reframing the story of church. But you will find that all the way through there are practical handles, tips, and checklists to facilitate application of what is being said.

## You Gotta Move It, Move It

We insist that a genuinely apostolic paradigm of the church is by nature inclusive of all forms in ser vice of its mission, whereas the more institutional paradigm is by nature exclusive, demanding high conformity. So we fully recognize, with the writers of The Starfish and the Spider, that all organizations are really hybrids of both centralized and decentralized forms of organization.12 And while it’s highly unlikely many of the prevailing forms of church in the West can become pure people-movements, we believe that the future viability and growth of the church requires that we have to move more and more toward embracing the forms we call apostolic movements.

We say this because (as we have seen) what has gotten us here will not get us there, but also because it’s clear from church history that movements are our best and most effective expressions of ecclesia.

Not only is it our most primal story — the New Testament church was clearly an apostolic movement — but also throughout history it appears we're at our very best when we have little or nothing of what we think constitutes the church institution.

Multiplication + Church Planting + Mission of All People Everywhere = Apostolic Movement

Looking at the early church, the Celtic movement, the Moravian movement, contemporary China, India, and so on, we are at our transformative best as decentralized movements, and we grow faster that way than we ever can with all the institutional accoutrements of church.

The church Jesus designed is a movement and not a religious institution. If this isn’t the case, then there’s no way to understand why Jesus reserves his harshest criticisms not for the so-called sinners but rather for the religious people of his day. It also explains why he chose and empowered ordinary people and not the religious elite to take the gospel to the world. This isn’t to say God doesn’t like order or that there’s no structure to movements; it is to say the original church structure is very unlike the kind of structures that emerged with the Christendom form of church.

We aren’t saying God hasn’t or doesn’t use all expressions of church — clearly he does. We are not even saying that a certain level of institution is not actually necessary to maintain longevity; it is.

What we are saying is that we can all do it a whole lot better, and with more theological integrity, by activating an apostolic imagination and by developing movemental forms of the church.

### Discarding Either/Or, Embracing Both/And

We have shared this vision of Future Travelers and this book with our grassroots missional friends, and a common response has been, "It can't be done." We also have spent time with leaders of large established churches who shake their heads in pessimism. The truth is that both groups, being purists, are captive to the limits of their own acquired (somewhat prejudicial) thinking and are blinded to the possibilities of seeing the church become more. The problem is that for the vast majority of churches and Christians, this oppositional thinking has blocked our capacities to discern a way forward. It also implies that the only way forward for the established church is to close up shop and start again from the ground up. It is a counsel of despair for the established church and signals increasing marginalization from the mainstream for the missional movement as it now exists.

Part of the problem with this is because, to use business consultant Jim Collins’ terms, they fail to embrace the genius of the and. Both groups are locked into the trap of either/or thinking. Seen from the perspective of either/or, these forms of church are irreconcilable, but reconceived from the perspective of the both/and, the supposed clash of imaginations begins to fade away. Collins rightly says that a truly visionary organization “embraces continuity and change, conservatism and progressiveness, stability and revolution, predictability and chaos, heritage and renewal, fundamentals and craziness. And, and, and.”13 In moving forward and engaging the issues we face, we have no doubt this must be the case.

I (Alan) admit that in my own early days as a church planter, leadership developer, and missional strategist for my denomination, I was much more inclined to this oppositional kind of thinking. The breakthrough happened for me in researching for The Forgotten Ways, when I came to the astonishing realization that every church, incarnational and attractional and everything in between, already has the full potential of Apostolic Genius resident in it, and all that is needed is for us to reactivate it.14 This is a very powerful idea you should ponder for a while, because if it’s true — and I am convinced it is — then it changes everything.

> We'll spend time later on the process of reactivation, but we mention it here simply to suggest that every church, indeed every believer, has the full capacity for world transformation within, and when we activate it, it changes everything.

But we have to be able to see it first. And, if we are willing, then we will find that the missional and the established forms are not mutually exclusive, because our core ecclesiology not only allows for but also champions both approaches.

But let us be clear: we believe church can be attractional and missional at the same time only if the organizational genetics, our core ideas, the paradigmatic brain at the center, legitimizes both impulses as important and justifiable expressions of what it means to contextualize the gospel in the Western world. It is this victory on the level of imagination — of our vision of the church as Jesus designed it to be — that makes a Verge church a real live possibility.

This isn’t necessarily easy, however, because we are steeped in oppositional-type thinking and because the movement approach on which so much depends has been largely marginalized, is misunderstood, and is underdeveloped. Verge churches will be those that have somehow found the necessary intellectual freedom and imaginative space to be able to overcome the captivity to their own prevailing ideologies — and, in light of that, are willing to reframe their core paradigm from being a church to being a movement. One of the main ways to do this is to get over the impasse of either/or and imagine a church that embraces the both/and.

## Mix and Match

Essentially, the new paradigm of apostolic movements is the “conVergence” of three distinct ways of thinking about church:

- Church-growth theory, which extends and maximizes traditional

ecclesiology and organizes the church around the evangelistic function.

- Exponential thinking, as an application of the emerging science of

idea-viruses and tipping points to ecclesiology. It has also stimulated church-planting efforts over the last decade or two.

- Incarnational missiology, which requires reorienting the entire

church around the primarily outward-oriented function of mission and recontextualizing the church into different subcultures.

We suggest a new paradigm (see fig. 3), and it will, we believe, define the thinking and practice of the church for the next few decades and present the church with its first real opportunity to reverse the long-term decline in every Western context. So when exponential/ viral/networked thinking informs church-growth savvy, which in turn is being reframed around missional-incarnational theology, then history is in the making. off-site churchmissional incarnational growth projects mission practices approaches Verge churches Church multisites Planting Movements exponential systems

The reason why we feel so bullish about what is happening is because it brings together our very best thinking about mission with current best practices in church leadership and organization.

The integration of the contemporary megachurch thinking with the more missional grassroots approach will result in better-resourced, better-led, savvy expressions of church, reframed by the deepest currents in the biblical story (missional-incarnational) and restructured around the world-changing organizational paradigm of exponential people-movements. What’s not to celebrate?

> Renovating Old Truths: Remembering the Forgotten Ways

This concept of renovating ancient truths is critical if what we are suggesting is to be understood as more than another church-growth fad. In The Forgotten Ways, I (Alan) suggest we can infer from the dynamics of exponential people-movements that all of God’s people already have everything in them to be able to get the job done. I call this “dormant (or latent) potentials,” and it fully explains why, for instance, the pre-communist Chinese church, a highly institutional form of church, can end up looking and acting just like the early church when all the institutional forms are removed because of external threat and persecution.

The only conclusion I could reach was that the full possibility of movement was already there in the system. All that was needed was something to activate it. Apostolic Genius, the name of the phenomenon which encodes apostolic movement in what I call In the church Jesus mDNA, is latent in the church but is largely dormant built, conversion because it’s buried under the more institutional forms is commission or and blinded by the predominant mindset.

In the practice of contemplative prayer, we relax baptism is ordination, our well-practiced defenses and inner chatter to take your pick. become alert to the God-who-is-already-there. We realize afresh that he has been there all along; it was we who were not aware. So too the solution to our situation is already embedded in the theological genetic codes of church.

The answer for the church lies in the deepest framework of our ecclesiology as Jesus designed it. We are not simply saying this as a little peppy inspirational thing; we are stating a deep truth that will help us avoid importing false and misleading ideas and methodologies into the church in order to motivate it. This is not magic but simply recognizes that God has invested his people with real potentials, due largely to the ever-present kingdom of God, the lordship of Jesus, the transforming power of the gospel, and the presence of the Holy Spirit in and among the people of God. We are the church of Jesus.

Furthermore, we can say, from the study of mass movements in general, that many of the same dynamics exist in all human movements. For instance, organic systems don’t just serve Christian missional movements and disciple-making. Apprenticing people into a system or ideology is something all organizations can do. It’s not magic; it’s what living systems theorists call “distributed intelligence” and recognizes that in God’s world there is inherent order and design and that systems tend to be self-organizing.

It’s not as strange as it sounds at first. For instance, we can acknowledge that in every seed is the potential for a tree, and in every tree is the potential for a forest. But the potential is all contained in the initial seed. Thinking this way, we can say that in every seed there is a forest. Likewise, in every spark there is the full potential of the flame, and in every flame the potential of a massive inferno. But it’s all there, in potential at least, in the tiny spark.

Apostolic Genius is a term that encompasses the six elements of mDNA, which we’ll discuss later in thebook. These six elements are:

1. Jesus is Lord
2. Disciple-making
3. Apostolic environment
4. Missional-incarnational impulse
5. Organic systems
6. Communitas

This mDNA changes everything, because it’s not that we have to import some alien set of ideas into the church but rather that we must reactivate what is already there in potential. When we suggest we have to (re)activate Apostolic Genius at the very core of the church/organization, it means we’re simply triggering what’s already present. The approach taken in this book will therefore be to remember what we’ve tended to forget, and to forget some things we’ve tended to remember.

## A Chaordic Approach to Change

The apostolic movement way of thinking should be embedded in the very heart of each church/organization; this in turn will inform innovative ethos and practices throughout the rest of the church/organization.

Dee Hock is right when he says, “Purpose and principle, clearly understood and articulated, and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization. To the degree you hold purpose and principles in common among you, you can dispense with command and control. People will know how to behave in accordance with them, and they’ll do it in thousands of unimaginable, creative ways. The organization will become a vital, living set of beliefs.”15 He says elsewhere, “All organizations are merely conceptual embodiments of a very old, very basic idea — the idea of community.

They can be no more or less than the sum of the beliefs of the people drawn to them; of their character, judgments, acts, and efforts. An organization’s success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles and strength of belief in them than to assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be.”16 Hock calls this the “chaordic” principle: enough order at the center to give common identity and purpose, enough chaos to give permission to creativity and innovation. When you think of it, this is exactly how the original Jesus movement was organized, and we suggest that this is how we should strive to reframe our understanding of ecclesia as we move toward Verge church thinking.

It is critical to engage this process with the assumption that all lasting change needs to be systemic in nature. Asystem is a series of interrelated and interdependent parts. That means when one agent or part of the system is changed, the whole system is affected — for better or worse.

## A Model for Apostolic Movement

Before you come to the end of this book, we want to clearly answer the very practical question, “How do I begin apostolic movement in my church?” This is what we will call “movementum.” Here is the process this book will take to get you to movementum: Part 1: “Imagine.” We will begin with the importance of missional imagination in helping us to rethink what we mean by ecclesia, and move on to imagining new possibilities. Imagination allows us to see the mission as Jesus sees it. The goal in this step is for each individual and the community to “see it.” Part 2: “Shift.” This second section forms the paradigm-shifting heart of thebook. Here we describe how churches can activate apostolic movement vision and philosophy at the heart of the church. We must reframe our basic concepts of church to understand the mission as Jesus understands it. The goal in this step is for each individual and the community to “get it.” Part 3: “Innovate.” We then look into the dynamics of genuine innovation (as opposed to simple creativity), without which we are doomed to simply repeat what we already know. The church ought to do mission as Jesus does it. The goal in this step is for each individual and the community to “do it.” Part 4: “Move.” In the final section, we explore what it takes to practically generate and maintain actual movement, or this movementum, throughout the church and become a Verge church. Movementum can be defined as the process of gaining missional momentum until we birth an apostolic movement, and movementum occurs when we are continuously taking our church through the preceding three stages: imagine, shift, and innovate.

The moves for an individual believer are the same as those of an entire community, as shown in figure 4.

This isn’t a change process you complete only once. This involves an ongoing cycle of renewal: to see (imagine) what Jesus wants you to see; to fully get (shift) and understand what he wants you to understand; and to obey (innovate) and do what he wants you to do. This is a constant process every church and every believer will go through over and over again with a relentless desire to see an apostolic movement and the mission of Jesus accomplished.

Michael Fullan, the Canadian guru on leadership and change, has observed that the two greatest failures of leaders are “indecisiveness in times of urgent need for action and dead certainty that they are right in times of complexity.”17 As we go about the task of moving to the Verge, we have to be willing to let go of prior certainties and go on a search for new, more sustainable ways of being God’s people in our day. We need to feel a relentless urgency, for the time is upon us.

Decisions we make now will determine the course of events. We do live on the verge of the future.

Now is that time; lean into it.

## Discussion Questions Open

Would you describe yourself as driven by competition or by uncharted waters? One way to gauge this is to look at the kind of activities in which you are involved.

## Explore

1. What was your gut response to this chapter? Overwhelmed,

excited to continue, unsure, affirmed, convicted?

2. Looking at your current context, would you say you are

attempting to reach the 40 percent or the 60 percent? How are you being relevant in the lives of those who would never set foot in a church?

3. How do the following verses support the North American

church continually embarking into blue oceans? Traditionally, what arm of the local church uses these verses most?

You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

— Acts 1:8 Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” — Matthew 28:18

4. Take an honest look at the future of your church. Would you

say your church is positioning itself to chart a course into a blue ocean or fighting to stay relevant in a red ocean? Where do you find yourself personally more drawn: red oceans or blue?

5. Within your congregation, who has the most relational potential with the 60 percent of your community who will not attend your church? How have you helped empower those men and women with the gospel?

6. We aren’t suggesting that traditional or even attractional

expressions of church close up shop, so how would you imagine a both missional and attractional expression be lived out in your congregation?
