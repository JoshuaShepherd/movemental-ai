Gordon McKenzie, in his creativebook on organizations, Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool’s Guide to Surviving with Grace, describes a story from his childhood where he and his cousin learned to “mesmerize” chickens on his uncle’s farm. They did so by capturing a chicken and holding its beak down to a white line of chalk until it became spellbound. The chickens would remain frozen in this position until the boy’s uncle would come along and give them a kick in the backside to wake them up from their hypnotic stupor.1 McKenzie tells the story because he notes that organizations, like the white line of chalk in his story, can have a mesmerizing effect on people in their orbit. They create a culture of conformity that requires docility and dull obedience from their members. This stifles appropriate dissent and puts a lid on imagination and innovation. Unfortunately, churches can also tend to have the same effect on their leaders as well as on community members. Something in our traditions, theology, or inherited methodology tends to keep our collective noses down on the line. We rarely break free to do something genuinely imaginative, something adventurous, or something that challenges the status quo. Like it or not, we behave like a group of mesmerized chickens. And, like them, every now and again we need God to give us a proverbial kick in the backside to break our inertia and get us moving again.

## It’s Church, but Not As We Know It

Leadership guru Max De Pree noted that the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality.2 I fully recognize that Jesus gets the privilege of decisively defining the movement that claims his name; nonetheless, leaders in his church need to take this task of defining the parameters of how people think about the church with utmost seriousness. Allowing Jesus to guide us, it is part of the leadership task to somehow manage how the rest of the organization as a whole sees itself and its function in the world. In other words, it’s the leaders’ job to define ecclesia for the people and organizations they lead.

This puts a huge theological responsibility on leadership to ensure they have a vision of the church that is consistent with the church Jesus built. We cannot shirk this, especially in moments of crisis that require accurate recalibration.

De Pree’s punchy axiom highlights the leadership role very well, as it points us to that which we as leaders in the church ought to be ultimately concerned with: defining reality.

In the following chapter, we will explore some Marx was right: religion is mental verges that, we believe, will get us closer the opiate of the masses. to the reality of seeing the church as apostolic Religious institutions dull movement; here we will simply look at the role people to their responsibiliparadigms and imagination play in hemming us in or giving us a way as to move beyond the ties as disciples of Jesus. prevailing status quo. Wake up.

It has been said that we don’t know who discovered water but we know it wasn’t the fish. For many people, church is so much part of their world that they seldom if ever stop to think about the prevailing systems-story that underlies their experience of church. Henri Matisse once noted that to look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage. We are framed by seventeen centuries of Christendom. Thinking about the church requires keen spiritual insight, born of prayer, to develop the theological imagination (and courage!) to be able to see things beyond the status quo of the predominant paradigm.3 This is why any exploration of imagination must understand how paradigms operate and how they capture and/or shape our imagination. Conversely, paradigms are important because to shift from one paradigm into another, imagination is essential. The process, as we shall see, is largely intuitive and playful.

So when we talk about missional imagination, it’s really describing an imagination primarily shaped by the Missio Dei, the kingdom of God, and the incarnation. These provide the framework for interpreting the Christian reality.

## If You Can’t Imagine It, You Can’t Do It

Einstein, one of the greatest paradigm shifters of all time, reminds us of our sacred duty to dream God’s dreams and rediscover the transforming power of the imagination. He could well have been talking of 56 Part 1 Imagine the Western church when he said, “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.”4 Einstein ascribed most of his real creativity, his capacity for creating new ways of understanding the world, to the function of the imagination. He famously quipped that if you can’t imagine it, you can’t do it. Elsewhere he revealingly said that when he examined himself and his own methods of thought, he concluded that the gift of imagination meant more to him than his clearly remarkable talent for absorbing positive knowledge.5 He says imagination is in fact more important than knowledge because knowledge is limited but imagination circles the globe. With this approach, he transformed our understanding of the universe — no less than three times.6 What is particularly interesting here, and relevant to the role of imagination in paradigm shifts, is to note that most (if not all) of what Einstein did was not born out of real “hard science” in the lab!

Rather his breakthroughs came via what he called “thought experiments” — acts of imagination — some of which came to him while sitting at a train station in Bern, Switzerland. The experiments to prove his thought experiments were subsequently done by other scientists.

As it turns out, two of the biggest breakthroughs in physics hung on the ability to marvel at the mundane, to let imagination birth a new perspective: I saac Newton, with a falling apple; and Einstein, with the trains in Bern!

Geoff Maddock, a dear friend of mine, recently reminded me that Jesus is a big believer in the human imagination. Over and over again Jesus uses stories and parables to capture the imaginations of those around him. And yet he isn’t just a storyteller trying to entertain; he is a great teacher who knows that whatever gets our imagination (and attention) will ultimately capture our entire lives (Matt. 6:19 – 21).

We give ourselves over to what we conceive to be good and worthy of our efforts and resources. We also, regretfully, give ourselves over to sinful impulses. Jesus teaches that how and what we imagine is truly serious and profoundly spiritual. If we allow our imaginations to be caught up in the kinds of things Jesus taught and the kinds of miracles Jesus performed, we will be ready to live like him — according to the will of the Father and in the power of the Spirit. How might we see greater transformation in believers if people invited Jesus into their imaginations?7

## Telling an Alternative Story

Although all of us have heard about successful attempts to revitalize existing churches, we have to acknowledge that the overall track record is very poor. Few congregations ever achieve positive growth curves again once they’ve begun to decline. What’s more, church leaders report that their attempts to revitalize their churches don’t yield the desired results. Alot of energy (and money) is put into change programs, with all the usual comDiscipleship is key to munication exercises, consultations, workshops, and so on. Like fad dieting, it achieves short-term results Verge church effecbut not long-term solutions. tiveness: it is critical In the beginning, things seem to change, but to credibility, embodigradually the novelty and impetus tends to wear ment, and transmisoff, and the organization ends up settling back into sion of our message. something of its previous configuration. So instead of managing new organizations, leaders end up managing the unwanted side effects of their efforts. The reason for this is simple, though often overlooked: unless the paradigm at the heart of the culture is changed, there can be no lasting change. Change must come from deep inside the paradigm; anything less will simply be external and cosmetic.

I van I llich, the educator and philosopher, was once asked what he thought was the most radical way to change society. Was it through violent revolution or gradual reform? He gave a careful answer: neither.

Rather he suggested that if one wanted to change society, one must tell an alternative story.8 I llich is right; we need to reframe our understandings through a different lens, an alternative story, if we wish to move beyond the limitations of the prevailing paradigm that clearly dominates our current approach to leadership and church.

Telling the different story means reframing the central story that defines our understanding of church. It also means allowing that reframed story to seep into our ethos and practices. This reframing 58 Part 1 Imagine of the all-determining paradigm, effectively the brain of the organization, is essential to change, growth, and impact. For those wishing to activate the Verge church approach, it will require exercising the latent apostolic capacities lying at the heart of the church Jesus built.

To mix up some metaphors, we have to reframe our thinking, rescript the story, rewrite the internal program — take your pick!

Agreat example of offering an alternative interpretation, an alternative meaning to our story, comes once again from Rob Wegner of Granger Community Church. He reports that over the last year, every time he taught, he would deliberately reframe the story of GCC as movement, both locally and globally. He says, “Afew months back I spent half a message ‘retelling’ GCC’s entire story through the filter of movement, tying it back to the early church. The people that are reading this from a megachurch background will probably have stories of ‘micro-movements’ from their history too. For example, in the early days of GCC, when there was no permanent building and the pioneering spirit was everywhere, it had the vibe of a movement. When a new ministry becomes a ‘breakout,’ it has the vibe of a movement.... We have to find those reference points in our own story and then tie them back to the Acts [early church] identity as movement, proclaiming, ‘This is who we are meant to be!’ ” This is exactly what is needed: a reframing of our narratives in light of our most primal stories — the apostolic movement of the early Christian church and other amazing apostolic movements in history.

## Paradigm-eh-tic?

So what, then, is a paradigm? Thomas Kuhn, who did so much to help us understand the complex nature of paradigms, suggests that they are a way of trying to both understand our world and solve the problems of understanding by relying on a set of assumptions — which in turn help us interpret our situation and therefore give rise to possible solutions.9 These solutions are breakthrough advances in learning and understanding that trigger new paradigms, thus outdating previous ones. For instance, paradigm shifts explain how Copernicus changed our view of the universe and of our place within it, and how Einstein changed the game from physics to quantum theory.10 Similarly, David Bosch, one of the key missiologists in the twentieth century, suggests there have been six paradigm shifts in missiology.11 For instance, the shift from the pre-Constantinian church to the post-Constantinian one involved a massive paradigm shift. The Reformation was another. Although the Reformation did not fundamentally affect our ecclesiology, it certainly changed the way we thought about God, the gospel, salvation, and so on. In our day, the missional conversation is now fundamentally changing the paradigm; we are smack-bang in the middle of this shift right now.

## Imagination Is the Key

If paradigms determine our interpretation and frame our understanding, then the way to comprehend and develop them must take place at the level of imagination. Imagination is soaked in possibility; it can see around corners and make the intuitive leaps that trigger paradigm shifts. But in order to unlock the power of imagination, we first need to understand the nature of paradigms. So get your thinking gear on and seriously grapple with this, because it is key to advancing the cause of the church in our time. (See fig. 5.) For our purposes, we can say that the paradigm (systems story, ecclesial genetic code, organizational brain, or whatever you wish to call it) is made up of the following:

1. Unspoken assumptions and beliefs that over time take on the

power of controlling myths or codes.

2. Primary metaphors we use to describe ourselves (body of Christ, church as organism, family of God, local fellowship, and so on).

3. Aworking model: the protocols, policies, and templates that

guide behavior and choices (clearly the most visible/explicit part of the paradigm).

4. Manifestations of organizational culture (the “petals” in the

diagram), composed of rituals, symbols, language, power arrangements, and so on. While these are important and overt, the core paradigm is maintained in the myth-metaphor-model structure.

60 Part 1 Imagine theology myths/codes background assumptions, scripting, and underlying belief system rituals and generated in organization symbols routines metaphors shorthand descriptions of underlying belief system

## The paradigm or systems story

control exemplars systems models strategies or ideas in action organizational structures

## Figure 5

Every organization is built upon this underlying paradigm or genetic coding. This is not the same thing as the church’s beliefs or theological systems. Rather the paradigm determines how an organization feels, thinks, and thus acts. This paradigm therefore determines the way an organization behaves, no matter how the organizational chart is drawn. The paradigm explains and then guides behavior, and because of this it’s the primary template that shapes all other things.

Restructure the organization but leave the original paradigm in place, and nothing will change within the organization.

The truth is that most change programs concentrate on the petals; that is, they try to effect change by looking at structures, systems, and processes. Experience shows us that these initiatives usually have a limited success. Veteran church consultant Bill Easum says it this way: “Following Jesus into the mission field is either impossible or extremely difficult for the vast majority of congregations in the Western world because of one thing: They have a systems story that will not allow them to take the first step out of the institution into the mission field, even though the mission field is just outside the door of the congregation.”12

It’s because of this that reframing the central paradigm of church is one of the keys to change and much-needed innovation. Aparadigm shift is a change to a new game, a new set of Verge church thinking rules. And this in turn means we must reactivate our underutilized imaginations. therefore is first and Verge church thinking therefore is first and foremost an exercise in foremost an exercise in a distinctively aposa distinctively apostolic tolic imagination — we have to (re)imagine the imagination — we have to church in light of its apostolic design and imperative. If we fail to reframe the issues on this most (re)imagine the church in fundamental level, we won’t activate apostolic light of its apostolic design movements. We are back to needing to dethrone and imperative.

Constantine in order to advance Verge church thinking; to do this, we need the original (and originating) apostolic imagination that inspired and shaped the world’s most transformative Jesus movements.

## Was Blind but Now I See: The Problem of Paradigm Blindness 

The Zenith Drilling Company prided itself on being the best drillbit-producing company in the world. In many ways, they had revolutionized the industry, using tungsten-tipped drill bits. The problem is, the competition caught up with them and began to erode Zenith’s market share to the point where profitability was in question. The board of directors decided to get a new CEO who could perhaps help the company recover its previously held market-leader status.

The new CEO called all the leaders and managers to a threeday crisis conference, where he asked everyone to clarify what they thought the mission of the company was. After much conversation and deliberation, they decided that their mission was not only to make drill bits but also to make the best drill bits in the world. They all agreed this was an excellent purpose for the company.

At this point, the new chief executive said, “No! Your job is not to make the best drill bits in the world; rather it is to make the best holes 62 Part 1 Imagine in the world!” They went on to innovate laser drilling and become the best hole-making company in the world.

This is a good example of seeing the same thing but from a different vantage point. And in many ways, this same change of perspective helps us understand how preconceived notions and paradigms have blinded people to how God was really working. Much of the theology of John is built on this concept, and it’s seen in scriptural encounters such as Luke 24, where the disciples were at first prevented from “seeing” Jesus (v. 16) and then had their eyes opened as he broke bread with them. Like an Escher painting, a change of perspective changes everything.13 We need to exercise what we call the paradigmatic imagination, because any prevailing paradigm, ecclesiological or otherwise, acts as a kind of mental lens that helps us understand the world. As such, they are necessary and unavoidable in framing our sense of reality and functionally negotiating our way through our world. But paradigms also impose limitations of how far thinking can go, because they selectively screen out important facts to fit the internal mindset, wishful thinking, and emotional overinvestment in maintaining the status quo. In other words, they blindside us, creating the situation where those who dance are thought to be quite insane by those who cannot hear the music, as Angela Monet so famously said.14 That paradigms conceal as much as they reveal also explains why the formation of a new paradigm opens up new ways of perceiving and acting that overcome the limitations of the old one. This is why, as Thomas Kuhn showed in his definitivebook on the subject, paradigm shifting is how every major new discovery is made in all spheres of knowledge and endeavor.15 But paradigm blindness also shows how development and growth can be blocked and why it’s important to be passionately committed to finding new and imaginative ways forward.

The creative role of the paradigmatic imagination, as well as its capacity to blind us, is very much echoed in the biblical use of the word heart in both Old and New Testaments. While the Bible never uses the term paradigm, the heart and imagination are portrayed as being the seat of intellectual and emotional functions (Ps. 14:1; Lam.

2:11) as well as the origin of will and intellect. It’s the heart that provides us with the ability to “see”: to give direction, make choices, and discern between lies and truth (Jer. 17:9; Eccl. 10:2). The link between a passionate and unrelenting love of truth and the capacity to see is clearly referenced by Jesus when he says in Matthew 5:8, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God” (that is, they will be able to imagine/perceive him rightly). It also implies that the paradigmatic imagination can block our seeing when we are bound too closely to a certain paradigm or framed way of seeing.16 This has both frightening as well as thrilling aspects, as is seen in Jesus’ application of Isaiah 6:10: “This people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them” (Matt. 13:15).

In some cases, the dominance of a paradigm can approximate what the Bible means by stronghold, because there is no doubt our thinking can sometimes profoundly lock us into patterns. Religiosity is a classic example. The Pharisees were highly dedicated scholars and passionate people, and yet they missed the Messiah they so ardently searched for (John 5:39 – 40). They studied the Scriptures to learn about God, and yet they entirely missed what God was doing! How? The only way to understand this is to recognize that they were blinded by their own paradigm. Similarly, we are instructed by Paul to demolish such mental strongholds and take every thought and imagination captive to Jesus (2 Cor. 10:1 – 6). This means, among other things, that we must allow Jesus to frame our most fundamental paradigm: Christology.

To illustrate paradigmatic imagination and paradigm blindness, consider the well-known image that, depending on how you perceive it, looks like either a young woman or an old crone. The issue is that generally we see one to the exclusion of the other, but both are there.

We choose one or the other, and we can’t see both at the same time.

On the one hand we see, and on the other we are blinded.

It’s the paradigm itself, the hidden and determinative assumptions we hold about life, that help us to see. But our paradigm also deters us from seeing a better way when it presents itself to us. If we are to break out of the established ways of doing things and find a new and better way, we are going to have to allow our imaginations to be (re) infused with ancient truths. Bill Easum says, “Churches wanting to break free from the quagmire of their dysfunctional systems and climb 64 Part 1 Imagine out of their downward death spiral must learn to feel, think, and act differently than they do now. The times in which we live require us to change our Life Metaphors, something akin to rewiring the human brain.”17 The Bible calls this repentance (metanoia, or turning in the mind), and it is critical if we are going to lead the church into the apostolic movement forms of the Verge church.

## Changing the Game

Before we look at practical ways to engender fresh and imaginative thinking, we believe it is vital to comment on the dynamics of paradigms and of paradigm shifting. Thomas Kuhn gave us the foundational text on this subject in his seminal book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, in which he describes the transitions between various scientific worldviews and how they were affected.18 Seeing that the church is also meant to be a community embracing the search for truth, Kuhn’s book is a tremendous resource in our attempts to reframe the mission of the church in the new millennial context. It also serves as a warning to us as to how easily vital new perspectives can be stifled by a predominant paradigm, something that has sadly been so much a part of historical Christendom. It’s important for the church to know something about the shift from one paradigm to another.

A paradigmatic shift involves the following stages (see fig. 6):

1. Structure/normalcy. We begin with a well-established paradigm, a captured (or closed) imagination, if you will, that dominates the thinking/consciousness, of the scientific philosophy of a period.

2. Anomalies. An increasing sense of anomaly develops from

within the paradigm, that is, a feeling that something is wrong. Or, at least, the prevailing mode of thought cannot resolve all the problems the paradigm itself faces or achieve its own vision of truth. Paradoxically, it is those who have mastered the prevailing paradigm who are most often the first ones to break from the consensus — for example, Einstein and Heisenberg in science, or Calvin and Barth in theology. The real experts are the ones most able and likely to perceive when things are wrong! Thus begins what Kuhn calls “a roaming of the mind,” a new sense of freedom to engage anomalies without recourse to the preconceived assumptions and set of solutions. Again, imagination and intuitive leaps are vital in shifting the paradigm.

3. Crisis. Slowly a growing (but inexorable) recognition is made

by more and more people that something is basically wrong in the prevailing conception of things; eventually a tipping point (crisis) is reached, and the trickle becomes a flood. Agroup of dissenters emerges, followed by a flurry of new theories in search of an alternative understanding of things.

4. Transition/restructuring. Anew paradigm (answer) begins to

emerge, most often with opposition by those who still hold strongly to the established paradigm — for example, Copernicus saved his neck only by recanting from the “heresy” implied in his theory but was still imprisoned for life. This is probably because some have invested their sense of selfhood in the paradigm and so receive their legitimacy from it. This is also why denominations seldom permit a questioning of their core organizational beliefs (commonly called sacred cows).

We mention this here because paradigm shifting, which is precisely what is required for us to become an authentic apostolic movement, will go through something of the process above. Another reason is because paradigm shifts involve exercises in imagination and creativity. They point us toward the need for the kind of innovation we will explore later in thebook. Also, this particular illustration of paradigm shifting highlights how imagination (and not simply acquired linear reasoning) plays a crucial role in helping people shift from one paradigm to another.

## Playing Our Way into a New Future

As followers of the Way, we must remember that imagination is not only the realm of fantasy and children’s games but also the proper place to locate our prayer, worship, and action — and, in our case, our desire to creatively lead the church into its missional calling. The scik n ow l e d g e b a s e PARADIGM 1 COMPETING PARADIGMS PARADIGM 2 Part 1 Imagine r a n d o m s h o c k s / t r i g g e r i n g eve n t s normalcy anomalies crisis selection transition normalcy Figure 6 Paradigmence of ideas also fully recognizes the critical role of the imagination, intuition, and insight in the development of breakthrough creativity.19 And there is a science to it! Imagination is the ability to visualize possibilities, to form images and ideas in the mind (especially of things never seen or never experienced directly), and to resolve problems while being guided largely by the nonlinear logic of intuition and insight.

Imagination derives from the creative part of the mind where new ideas, thoughts, and images are first conceived and formed. Analytic reasoning is important (and in the church, we rely on it through our well-developed theological rationality), but it takes imagination to get us beyond the impasse of any prevailing paradigm to genuinely innovate and find our way into breakthrough creativity. This is what is called “looking around corners.” Imagination requires that we be playful with the various elements in the organizational mix. Imagination is therefore, by nature, metaphorical thinking; it compares ideas that normally would not be related. By using a metaphor, a comparison of one thing to another, you intellectually connect disparate ideas. Once this connection is made, the metaphor is extended and the two things are allowed to grow, merging the two ideas together. The extension of the metaphor creates the framework for your new idea. The combining of ideas gives birth to a new thing. George Lucas combined mythology and science fiction to produce Star Wars. Mark Zuckerberg used the metaphor of a college yearbook and social networking to produce Facebook.20 The fundamental job of To unleash the power of imagination, we need apostolic imagination is to to allow ourselves to explore possibilities we have produce out of the church never thought of before. William James once said we now experience a genius means little more than the faculty of perceiving things that have become habitual in an vision of the church Jesus unhabitual way.21 Because it’s a dimension of the wants us to experience. human heart, real imagination requires a radical openness of mind and a willingness to repent of previous understandings when they seem to no longer fit. Similarly, as we’ve seen in our critique of the institutional paradigm, we’ve become profoundly habitual in our ecclesiology, our way of thinking about church. In 68 Part 1 Imagine order to advance, we will need to be willing to let go of the inadequate understandings blocking us from becoming a movement again.22 And here’s where the apostolic imagination will help us think differently about things assumed to be right.

World-famous U2 front man Bono challenges his audiences to dream up the world they want to live in, to dream out loud, at high volume. He is appealing to the inherently human capacity to create new possibilities and futures. If this is true for all humans — and clearly it is — then the godly imagination, because it is grounded in the gospel and inspired by the Holy Spirit, is hopeful, creative, and transformative. Applying this, we would then say that the fundamental job of apostolic imagination is to produce out of the church we now experience a vision of the church Jesus wants us to experience.

> The Verge-ination: Reimagining Church in Apostolic Perspective

It’s no coincidence this book is being released in the same year as my book The Permanent Revolution, which thoroughly explores the nature of apostolic imagination and practice for the contemporary church in the West. In “Shift,” the next section of this book, I will suggest the model of Apostolic Genius, composed as a system of six interrelating elements of what I call mDNA, the most coherent model of apostolic imagination and thinking I can offer. For now, I want to simply suggest that the following areas will need to be the focal points, or theological/organizational verges, around which we are to reimagine the church for our time. All of these are directly addressed, and I believe answered, in the Apostolic Genius concept we will explore later.

## Christology

In essence, the church needs to constantly return to its Founder in order to chart its way forward. He has full defining rights on the way the church defines itself in the world. We are Jesus’ people, and we are designed to reflect his purposes, his teachings, and his lifestyle and to fulfill his intended design for the church. Perhaps a way of saying this is that Jesus retains full rights regarding the church’s core intellectual property. And so any attempt to imagine a new future needs to ensure it is fully representing what the Founder wants and intends in the first place. If this was to be said theologically, it means Christology lies at the heart of church renewal in any time and place we find ourselves.

This is perhaps the most radical thing we can do, because it takes us back to the root (radix) of the church. This process, what I have called “re Jesusing the church” (in a book titled ReJesus), allows us to imagine futures consistent with God’s dream for the world; in the Scriptures, that dream is called the kingdom of God.23

## Missiology

Missiology explores the reasons why mission is integral to the life of faith as well as develops methods of how we might fulfill our calling as God’s missional people. The methods it develops ought to be consistent with the nature and purposes of the sent God who in turn sends us. In other words, it’s a thoroughly theological process (and not just a pragmatic one) that requires that our imaginations be inspired by who God is and how he engages the world. We also are inspired by the way the New Testament church so creatively extended this mission. We look to Jesus, we study the life of Paul, and we discover that mission does not simply involve attracting people to “church,” but rather it is about being sent into our worlds, into every domain, and going deep into culture.

Mission inspires innovation, deeper cultural engagement, and calls for more integrity in our witness. And because mission is tied to the very being of God and to the work of Jesus, it offers the imagination a profoundly rich resource in engaging culture, incarnating the gospel, sharing faith, and forming faith communities. Reengaging missional ways of doing church is a direct route to renewal of our theology and ecclesial imaginations.

## Organization

Organization is a social arrangement allowing people to pursue collective goals, control the performance of the members of a group, and distinguish the group from other groups. Because of this, it shapes so much of what we do and how we think. We all know this and experience it every day of our lives, and certainly we need organization of some form or another to get anything done collectively. But organiza- 70 Part 1 Imagine tions can, over time, develop into impersonal institutions that tend to impose conformity (that is, crush creativity), are change-resistant, and become controlling entities that resist the promptings of the Spirit and undermine the “people dynamic” of the gospel.24 We simply have to apply our imaginations to the issue of organization, because if we fail to do so, it will inevitably undermine all of our attempts to become a more fluid and adaptive apostolic movement.

## Discipleship

Another area of focal concern for imagination should be around the issue of how we form and empower the people of God. This is no small issue, because if we fail to activate every believer in their Godgiven calling to be an agent of the King, it’s doubtful we will ever become a dynamic movement at all. If we don’t disciple people to be like Jesus, not only is our witness distorted, but also we can never hope to develop Christlike leaders.

We have to admit that our imaginations are stuck here. So much of our current energies are put into pastoral programming and worship, but these understandable emphases have by and large failed to develop mature disciples. If we put similar effort into apprenticing people in the way of Jesus, we can expect significantly different results.

Once again, all four of these Verge focal points (Christology, missiology, organization, and discipleship) are addressed, and I believe resolved, by applying the Apostolic Genius (mDNA) model we’ll explore later in thebook.

## An I maginative Solution

In the first chapter, we suggested that the church in the West faces two major problems arising from the endemic shift to post-Christian culture in the West (the 60:40 problem). We saw that the first problem is a strategic one, because most churches focus on a diminishing segment of the population and effectively compete for the same slice of the market. The other issue is the distinctly missionary one and raises the problem of how we get our message to an increasingly unchurched, alienated, and culturally diverse audience. So how does missional (apostolic) imagination help us resolve these two major problems?

> Addressing the Strategic Problem

As I’ve stated before, Einstein noted that the problems of the world couldn’t be resolved by the same thinking that created those problems in the first place. In other words, the kind of thinking (the paradigm) that got us to this point in history cannot generate the solution to the very problems it has created for itself. We need to break the monopoly of the institutional paradigm in order to morph into an apostolic movement again. As we’ve noted, this is exactly where apostolic/missional imagination helps us.

By following the radical, living, upside-down Messiah/Prophet, we are actively drawn into a kingdom that can’t be contained in human institutions. When we allow our imaginations to be profoundly shaped by the doctrine of the Missio Dei and the incarnation of God in Jesus, we are inspired to find new ways to meaningfully live out the good news to people around us. When we reimagine organization in terms of networks and living systems, we will generate new forms of ecclesia and allow them to develop; these in turn become the seeds of the future church. The church imagineered around these invigorating themes ought to be a highly creative, multicultural, multidimensional, diverse, highly innovative enterprise. This is especially true because as a missionary agency incarnating the gospel into multiple contexts, it ought to mirror the wonderful cultural diversity making up the world. Seen in this light, institutional conformity is damaging to the commitment to incarnational ministry.

One size will not fit all anymore. If our only answer to the strategic challenge we face is another tweak of the same institutional paradigm that got us here, then we must expect 72 Part 1 Imagine to be (and will be) sorely disappointed, and church attendance will continue its long-term trend of decline. We need a blue ocean strategy: ecclesial innovation inspired by King Jesus, incarnational mission, living systems — all dedicated to creatively activating disciples. This is the answer to the infertile sameness of the prevailing forms. I nspired by the Holy Spirit, we have to dream up the church we want to worship in — there is no silver bullet, but there is a silver imagination.

Much of this book is dedicated to helping churches develop more diverse and innovative expressions of church. This is the kind of church we must become if we are to get over the current impasse; we must become a movement again. It’s worth noting again that the movemental paradigm we are suggesting in this book is inclusive of all forms of ecclesia, including ones that are more institutional in expression. Whereas, the institutional paradigm is by nature exclusive — it cannot make space in the paradigm for more-fluid and adaptive forms of ecclesia. In other words, the movemental paradigm is by nature a both/and form, while the institutional form maintains a stance of either/or.

I’m in no way suggesting we abandon the current forms, but simply that we allow for the significant experimentation, development, and innovation of new forms. The seeds of the future ecclesia will be found in the new forms that come out of the Verge process and others like it.

Addressing the Missionary Problem The related problem comes from the likelihood that around 60 percent of America’s population (much higher in Europe and Australia) is increasingly alienated from the prevailing forms of church. In missionary terms, it means they are culturally distant from us. As a sent and sending people (that is, missional people), it is our task to take the message to them and deliver it in ways meaningful to them. This means we need to reassess the situation in the light of best-practice missionary approaches.

We need to ask the question, what is the gospel for this people group? What would sound like good news to them? This means we must attend first to the existential and religious issues people are facing, before we can communicate how the gospel addresses them. Think of it this way: don’t plant churches; plant the gospel, and the church will grow out of it. This will mean we go back to our primal message and allow it to reframe the way we see church — not the other way around.

It’s imagination fired up by the gospel and its missional implications that drives the church to become more authentically evangelical.

If we persist with the current status quo, we are in effect asking the nonbeliever to do all the cross-cultural work in coming to church!

Remember, we are the sent ones — not them. So we not only bring people to church (that will work for the 40 percent); we also take church to the people (to reach the other 60 percent and growing).

We can’t front-load church into the equation of mission. We must go to the people group and — once we have understood their culture a whole lot more — then ask ourselves the question, what is church for these people? We can’t presume we have the answer up front. We can only know it from the context of mission.

It’s easy to see how these questions force us to innovate. Because culture and cultural context differs, it will mean we have to reimagine how we express ecclesia and how we communicate good news.

One of the major keys in reimagining church is unleashing all of God’s people as missional agents of the King, commissioned to represent him in every sphere and domain of society. The institutional paradigm, because it so identifies the church with its formal institutions (buildings, clergy, programs, and so on), effectively blinds its members to the profoundly missional capacities of the people of God as a kingdom of priests.

The church doesn’t consist of its institutions; it consists of the people of God. We know this in our theology, but our practice is almost entirely at odds with this belief. We have so identified the church with its rituals, theology, denominational templates, symbols, and professional clergy that we can’t see this remarkable truth.

Everyone in a movement, and not just the so-called religious professionals, must be activated and thus play a vital role in extending Jesus’ mission on earth. Everyone is in full-time ministry, and most of us express this outside the more formal church community, but it is still full-time ministry. In fact, this false distinction in what constitutes ministry is one of the major hurdles we have to overcome if we are going to activate as Jesus’ people.

74 Part 1 Imagine When you add to the ministry of every believer the idea that each carries the full potential of the whole movement in them, you’re seeing church very differently. You are thinking movement. Reflecting on people-movements, missiologist Donald Mc Gavran once said that “in every apple there is an orchard.” If we could just realize this amazing piece of truth — that every believer carries the full possibility of an ecclesia, and every ecclesia in turn has the full possibility of a movement — we will be well on our way to becoming the world-changing movement God designed us to be.

It is only when the people of God as a whole are activated in a movement that real-world transformation takes place. In Right Here, Right Now,25 I described a movement as comprising both the more formal, organized aspects of mission (what I call apostolic mission) and the “mission of the people of God.” Diagrammatically, it looks like figure 7. multiplication people on mission apostolic church planting in every sphere movement

## Figure 7

What we have here is reproducing churches (the round nodes) and disciples dispersed into the spheres of society (the Xnodes). When both these aspects come together, we have centers and hubs that provide the platform for launching the mission of every believer into every sphere. So both multiplication church planting and the mission of the people of God create apostolic movement. This way of looking at the church is paradigmatically different from the predominant way we see it now, and yet it is much closer to the image of the church in the New Testament and in all apostolic movements everywhere. Once again, we can imagineer our way to a more authentically missional, and therefore more biblically consistent, Christianity.

I know that all this talk about paradigm shifting seems somewhat overwhelming, but before we rush to the how-to, we need to make sure we really understand the why. (Don’t worry, the how-to is coming.) I can’t overemphasize how important it is to take this all in now, because the answers that so readily suggest themselves to us at this point come directly from the toolbox inherited from the prevailing paradigm, and they are insufficient to change the game. (Remember, doing more of the same will not produce different results.) We must do the hard work of recoding (telling a different story), and to do this, we must learn to work with conceptual tools of intuition and imagination. The next chapter will look at this, which is what I call the mission to the mind.

Winston Churchill remarked that in light of the fading of the British Empire, the empires of the future would be the empires of the imagination. This is profoundly true for the church in our day, particularly as we find ourselves on the back foot in every Western cultural context. If imagination is so important in change and development of human civilization in general, then for the church, apostolic imagination is a resource of almost inestimable worth as we once again negotiate becoming the kind of movement Jesus designed us to be in the first place.

> Dave’s Response to “The Silver Imagination”

God is not only creator but also creative and constantly creating and reimagining. We see this in Isaiah 43. First God challenges us to give up our old paradigm: “Forget the former things, do not dwell on the past.” Then he pleads with us to open up our imagination: “See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?” (Isa.

43:18 – 19). From the beginning, throughout the Old Testament, and into the future, God is reimagining his mission and almost begging us to see it! It’s as if you can hear God’s voice saying, “C’mon, people, don’t you see what I’m doing?” This is the premise of Neil Cole’s Church 3.0, in which he explains, “There have been two major upgrades in church formation since Acts that have changed the entire system. The first occurred dramatically 76 Part 1 Imagine during the rule of the Emperor Constantine. The church shifted from an underground, grassroots, organic movement [Church 1.0] to a more institutionalized organization [Church 2.0].... I believe the second major shift is occurring now in our lifetime [Church 3.0 — Apostolic Movement]. Many people want to go back to the beginning again. As much as I am enamored of what I learned about the church of the first century, we simply cannot go back; we can only go forward.” God is advancing into the future, and God’s people must go with him. And for us to move forward with him, we must open the eyes of our missional imagination and see what new thing God is doing.

In far too many corners of the church, the puritan (or primitivist) impulse is alive and well. The creative tension we’re called to occupy sees the rich wisdom of the past while being open to the Holy Spirit in order to become truly adaptive and anticipatory when it comes to future embodiment of God’s kingdom on earth.

The power of missional imagination is something I have experienced firsthand. It was on the back of a napkin while sitting alone in a little Mexican restaurant that I first drew a map of Chicago and then dozens of little circles representing future sites of the church we had just planted. I had never heard the term multisite, but in that moment I allowed the Spirit of God to infuse my imagination with his mission for my life and our church. God was doing a new thing, and I could see it. Fast-forward to several years later, and we are now one of the fastest-growing churches in the country, with eleven sites in the Chicago area and a network of more than one hundred churchplants around the world through New Thing. I know the power of missional imagination. Despite all that, I find myself looking at blank napkins again these days and wondering what God has next for us.

The reimagining process Alan just described isn’t a one-time event for a follower of Jesus, a leader in his movement, or his church. It is a continual process of imaginational reuptake and creative destruction — it’s putting yourself “out of business” before institutional calcification does it for you.

The systems story for Community Christian Church is that we are a missional church which is all about reproducing. We were good at reproducing large; we knew how to train up leaders from within and deploy the very best of them as staff, campus pastors, and church planters. While we were successful at reproducing new sites and churches with hundreds of people, we still had thousands of people sitting on the sidelines who were not fully engaged in the mission. We knew if we were going to see a movement, it would require reimagining our future.

Being absolutely convinced the future would be won or lost in the minds of our people, we brought Kim Hammond from Melbourne, Australia, to join our staff as the director of missional imagination. Kim had been Alan’s It is a continual proright-hand man for the Forge Training Network cess of imaginational in Australia, and he brought the experience and reuptake and creative knowledge we needed. One of my first conversadestruction — it’s putting tions with Kim was about movies, and that talk revealed a lot about the paradigm shift we needed yourself “out of business” to make. I told him I’d just seen a movie I really before institutional calciliked, I nvictus — the story of Nelson Mandela and fication does it for you. how he changed the entire direction of his country, South Africa. Kim said he too enjoyed I nvictus, but his recent favorite was Blindside; he loved the story of how a stay-at-home mom changed the life of one disadvantaged teenage boy forever. Then Kim said to me, “You like the story about the leader who comes in and brings massive changes to millions of people, but I prefer the story of one-on-one life change by an everyday person. Do you see the difference?” He added, “We need both. Community has been great at reproducing macro; now we need to help people see how we can be great at reproducing micro.” Kim was right. We had created a culture where people would sacrifice money, move their families, and change careers to be a part of a new site or new church — and that’s good. But we didn’t have a culture or practices that expected the mobilization of all people for mission into every sphere of life. Over the next several months, Kim met with paid and volunteer leadership from every campus to begin taking us through a reimagining process, with Christology, missiology, organization, and discipleship as the focal points.

In an effort to make this painstakingly practical, let me make a few suggestions regarding how to move through the process of missional imagination.

78 Part 1 Imagine

## Solitude and Prayer

Most of us leave solitude for the pull of the crowd. And when we think of creativity and imagination, our first reaction is to pull together the most creative people we know to brainstorm an idea. This thinking took off with the 1953 bestselling book Applied Imagination; however, more recently, Yale researchers have found that brainstorming can actually reduce a team’s creative output, and the same number of people can generate more and better ideas separately than together.26 So encourage people to spend time in solitude and prayer. Solitude has long been considered critical to the creative process. And if that is true, think how much more creative we can be when we are alone with the Creator. I’m convinced God passionately wants every one of us to understand our part in his mission and is willing to speak to us.

That is why Jesus told us, “The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest” (Luke 10:2 NKJV). Solitude, retreats, and silence are a great means for hearing from God and engaging our missional imagination.

## Life-on-Life Apprenticeship

People get mission when they see mission lived out; that is why apprenticeship (what Alan calls discipleship) is critical for reimagination. Our best estimate is that 10 percent of the people in most churches seem to understand that they are sent by Jesus and that they are Spirit-empowered to incarnate the gospel in their context, as Jesus was. They may not use this language, but they are living it out. We need this to rub off on others. This is exactly what Jesus did with his apprentices. Notice what he does right after he called his first followers together: “After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them” (John 3:22).

Doesn’t sound like a big deal — Jesus spent some time with his disciples. The word for “spend time” is diatribo (pronounced dia-TREEbo), which is a composite of two words: dia, which means “against,” and tribo, which means “to rub.” So diatribo means “they spent time rubbing off on each other.” Diatribo occurs in an apprenticeship. What the leader does rubs off on the apprentice. In a life-on-life apprenticeship, people will begin to see Jesus, they will see mission, they will see discipleship, and they will see how organic systems reproduce to create movement.

## Experiential Teaching

Alone, teaching on mission can be helpful, but it becomes a powerful tool for engaging the imagination when it is coupled with experiences. Aspecial series at a weekend ser vice or a series of workshops which include stories of people on mission and the commissioning of new people into mission are powerful examples of experiential teaching. I’ve seen it done where a series of workshops will include a testimony from someone who is active in mission and then concludes by commissioning someone new into ministry in their context. It was very compelling. There are studies that show that actual or simulated experiences in other cultures have proven to increase creativity. For instance, just watching a forty-five-minute slide show on the history of China will increase creativity in participants for one week.

And of course the best kind of experiential teaching is a field trip.

Whether the setting is local or global, if you are in a place where real mission is being lived out and you can teach from there, it promises to spark the imagination of every participant.

## Leaders Spark Imagination

Many churches are like gun powder; at first glance, it appears to be latent, dry, and easily blown away. But leaders can spark the missional imagination to create a great explosion in any church. If you want to see an explosion of missional engagement, start If you are a leader, the with the leadership. The best and simplest definibest way to turn mistion of leadership is influence, and when leaders live out life on mission, it will influence the whole! sional imagination from When Michael Stewart of Austin Stone Church a blurry phrase found moved into an under-resourced neighborhood in in a book to something Austin, Texas, it sparked the imagination of an your people see with entire church toward transforming that community. When Jon Ferguson moved his family from 20/20 vision is for you the suburbs into the city of Chicago, it sparked in to live it out.

80 Part 1 Imagine Community Christian Church the imaginative possibility of impacting both the suburbs and the city. If you are a leader, the best way to turn missional imagination from a blurry phrase found in a book to something your people see with 20/20 vision is for you to live it out.

When leaders are being the change they want to see, they spark the missional imagination of all who follow, and fan into flame the gift God has given them. If the fires of an apostolic movement are going to burn bright, they will be sparked by leaders who lead from the front and live it out.

> The 2.5 Percent Spark Imagination

In every group there are innovators: those who ignite the change before all others. The 2.5 percent of us who are innovators spark change in the 13.5 percent of those who are early adopters, and when you reach 16 percent of the group, the mission burns so red-hot, everyone can feel it.

Our first efforts to spark the missional imagination of the people at Community came when we identified the innovators — the people who were already doing it and/or trying to do it. This small group of people came together several times to share what efforts they were already piloting on their own and to learn from one another. From this group came some successes and also a lot of failures. We learned some things about what didn’t work and what does work, and we put together a library of stories that would ignite the imagination of any Christ follower toward mission. It is by experimentation and pilot projects that you first enroll the 2.5 percent, who in turn influence the 13.5 percent and, over time, the whole church.

> Alternative Stories Spark Imagination

Apredictable story is like a bedtime tale you’ve heard a hundred times — it’s designed to lull you to sleep. But telling an alternative story is like pulling the fire alarm in the middle of the night: it awakens everyone out of their slumber to a new reality. Alone, teaching on mission can be helpful, but it becomes a powerful tool for engaging the imagination when it’s coupled with stories and experiences. The commissioning of new people into mission can be a remarkable awakening for others. I’ve seen the commissioning of young artists to do ministry in each gig they play, the commissioning of a stay-at-home mom to do outreach in her neighborhood, and even the commissioning of a student who plans to lead a Bible study at school. Seeing others commissioned, especially in such alternative stories, is compelling.

These alternative stories don’t have to be our own. We did a workshop called Discover the Dream, where we not only taught on mission but also took people on an imaginary journey with Fridtjof Nansen, the great Norwegian explorer and Christ follower who saved millions of lives. We allowed participants to live through Nansen’s story. One participant said afterward, “At Discover the Dream, God pushed my clenched fists open and placed back in my hands the idealistic dreams of my late teens of working with and loving street people. Since that experience I have moved into a neighborhood where I am living out that dream and mission.” And of course the best kind of story is your own story. When you bring people into new experiences, it allows them to write a brandnew chapter in their stories. Whether the setting is local or global, if you put people into a setting where real mission is being lived out and they can experience it, it promises to spark the imagination of every participant.

Like the character of Neo in the film The Matrix, we are all asking the rhetorical question, “I can’t go back, can I?” The answer is obviously no. But the good news is, we have a God who is advancing into the future, and for us to be with him, we must open the eyes of our missional imagination and see the new things he is doing.

## Discussion Questions Open

When you were a child, what did you imagine you’d be doing by the age you are now? How did you imagine your life looking?

## Explore

1. What do you think is the current “story” of your church, as

most of your attenders would tell it? What are some things you wish they’d include? Exclude?

82 Part 1 Imagine

2. “This people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear

with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them” (Matt. 13:15).

How have we become calloused and paralyzed to a particular way of doing church? While we must be careful to gently convict, how could a refocusing on the person of Christ help us reframe our way of doing church?

3. Where is your church within the four steps of paradigm shifting (pp. 64–66): structure/normalcy, anomalies, crisis, transition/restructuring? How will you move to the next step?

4. Why is imagination so important in helping people make

the missional paradigm shift? Is it possible to expand people’s capacity to imagine?

5. “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am

doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?” (Isa. 43:18 – 19). What does your church need to stop dwelling on from its past? What new thing do you sense God is doing in your church/community?

## Move

1. Have everyone on your team imagine/dream what your church

could look like in five years. Have each person share one Godsized (but doable!) dream and one crazy, “out there” dream (for entertainment).

2. Alan encourages us to determine what the gospel looks and

sounds like in the context of those your church is attempting to reach. What is the gospel for this people group? What is good news to them? Come up with your answers as a team.
