> Ve r ge Vi b e The Operating System of Apostolic Movement

## ALAN

Ethos (n.) the character, sentiment, or disposition of a community or people, considered as a natural endowment; the spirit which actuates manners and customs; also, the characteristic tone or genius of an institution or social organization.

## — WWW. LEXIC. US

There are essential differences between institutions and movements: the one is conservative the other progressive; the one is more or less passive, yielding to influences from the outside, the other is active influencing rather than being influenced; the one looks to the past, the other to the future.... the one is anxious, the other is prepared to take risks; the one guards boundaries, the other crosses them.

> Whatever happened to Starbucks?

Starbucks emerged seemingly out of nowhere in the 1990s and made drinking coffee cooler (and more expensive) than ever by the early 2000s. Though existing as a seller of coffee equipment and beans since 1971, Starbucks was grown in the late eighties by entrepreneurial buyer Howard Schultz, who knew there was money to be made in crafting a space in which to both sell and enjoy brewed coffee and espresso. Through a number of wise business and cultural moves (including striking a lucrative deal with the also-rising Barnes & Noble bookstore chain in the nineties), Starbucks crafted a genuine “third place” vibe of quality, community, and cool-factor.1 You could say that its branding was pitch-perfect.

Flash-forward to the second decade of the twenty-first century: many twentyand thirty-somethings — the once-loyal customer base that made Starbucks what it was in the previous decade — have begun to dislike Starbucks, complaining of rising prices, the homogenized feel, and the sense that the pro-employee, pro-environment, and pro – fair trade stance might be more hype than reality. What was once lauded as cool is now often panned as corporate. This loss of cultural cachet, coupled with the difficult economy, has slowed the once-impossible growth of the beverage behemoth, causing many hipsters to defect to independent coffee shops (which are experiencing a bit of a renaissance) while blue-collar people are returning to Dunkin’ Donuts or even Mc Donald’s, which has been aggressively marketing their new coffee lineup against Starbucks (and winning). While Starbucks still sells a lot of coffee in a lot of locations, the uniqueness and shine of their brand is dulling, and they are now closing more stores than they are opening.

Starbucks has taken a hit because of a dwindling cultural identity.

They once had good ethos, but it wasn’t cherished, stewarded, and renewed properly. So now they face a crisis of ethos in their corporate culture and in the hearts and minds of their baristas, customers, and most notably ex-customers. The church is at a similar crossroads in this second decade of the twenty-first century. The attention to developing a consistent brand and ethos is similarly vital to becoming an apostolic movement.

## Ethos As Pivot

Developing an ethos is pivotal, because it is here where the Verge paradigm begins to inform and create an explicit Verge culture. Ametaphor from the world of computing might help us understand the function of an ethos: There are basically three levels of relationship between hardware and software in personal computers. First, there is the machine language — the code hardwired into the hardware itself.

Then, second, there is the operating system, which mediates between the hardware/machine language and the programs, which are in fact the third level. However necessary each of the three levels are, most of us will only ever interact at the programs level, and so it is with practices of the Verge church.

What we have called an apostolic movement paradigm corresponds to the machine language; the ethos, to the operating system; and the practices, to the programming (fig. 14). Acomputer is a system and the hardware is vital, as are the programs we use. But the interpretive core is the operating system. There is no way you can use your programs on your computer without the operating system. In the same way, ethos interprets Apostolic Genius (the hardware) into the system and makes it useable. programs interface with user practices operating system mediates between program and machine ethos machine language/hardware basic code of hardware Apostolic Genius

## Figure 15

As is true of all attempts to develop a living ethos in organizations, we are dealing to some degree with beliefs and ideas that lie beneath the level of corporate consciousness. Sure, people tend to be more aware of values and beliefs than they are of their paradigm(s).

Though they all have a paradigm, it doesn’t always mean they can articulate it, or that they haven’t uncritically adopted ideas from general culture, ones that are inconsistent with the way of Jesus. In fact, we would argue that all people, and therefore many churches, have indeed uncritically assumed the values of prevailing culture to some degree or another.

Part of the discipleship process (an element of mDNA, of course) is to instill a basis of theologically grounded and biblically consistent values, which in turn will set the culture and guide behavior and action. As an extension of the apprentice-making ethos, it’s therefore within the tasks of the leadership of Verge churches to create the right complex of values (an apostolic ethos), which is true to the genetic code of the church as Jesus designed it. When it comes to developing an authentic Verge church culture, this will mean we have to weed out missionally incompatible values and be very deliberate in articulating, as well as demonstrating, an ethos that directly draws its inspiration and direction from the core of mDNA at the paradigmatic heart of the church. We have to bring what is previously unarticulated (and therefore implicit) out into the explicit consciousness of the community.

An ethos should begin to explicitly (and implicitly) bring to light what we truly value. In other words, we have to name the values, make them explicit, and so develop a living ethos that will in turn set the cultural tone of the church/organization (fig. 16).2 concrete conscious

## PRAXIS

## ETHOS

## Paradigm

conceptual subconscious Figure 16 It’s All in the Ethos...

Just so that we are clear, to develop ethos, you will need to consciously do the following:

1. I dentify and Develop Beliefs

As Christians, our beliefs are of fundamental importance — we have an innate need to know that what we are doing has authoritative roots 152 Part 2 Shift in the revelation of God in Christ and in the Scriptures. But the process of learning to believe rightly isn’t automatic; it needs to be a deliberate, in-depth engagement with God through the Bible and in relation to context. This highlights the need for church leadership to be working theologians. While it’s crucial to let the felt-needs and questions of our native culture inform our spirituality, if we aren’t deliberate about thinking theologically and systemically about beliefs, then we hand the systems story of the church over to pop culture, mere pragmatism, or the many other prevailing forces that simply co-opt our thinking and doing.

Still, we need to be careful. All of us tend to select what is convenient to our dominant paradigm. That is exactly how the institutional paradigm has been able to legitimize itself (and thereby dismiss other forms) for over seventeen centuries! It also accounts for how we can screen out so much of the Bible’s teaching on idolatry (for example, money, sex, power) and justice (for example, care for the poor, economic disparity, gender relations) and focus on what suits us. Watch the selectivity with which we engage the Bible!

2. Formulate Values

Values are often implicit, but through a process of bringing them into the conversation, these should be made explicit and then sorted as to their relative weight and significance. In other words, we should become clear as to the difference between general values and core values. Core values get us all passionate and worked up. In fact, Dave suggests they’re what bring about spontaneous applause. Once we are clear about what we truly value, we can then begin to reorder our thinking and choices around them. In such a way, values become guides to thinking — shaping attitudes and behaviors.

In the next chapter, we will explain how core values form key practices, so it’s important to clarify them. If you have never gone through a process of clarifying core values, we suggest that you should. We will give you stacks of possible Verge church examples in the second half of this chapter.

3. Develop a Verge Vocabulary

If you can shape the various conversations that go on in the community, you can shape the culture. As we’ve said before, language shapes our consciousness. Words are the main bearers of meaning for people. If you can change the language, you actually restructure the way people process information and communicate at a very deep level.

In many ways, this is why the Bible is so strong on verbal integrity and against the sins of the tongue. Developing our vocabulary must not be done manipulatively, but we must recognize that it’s extremely important to shape the organizational discourse — to shape how members talk about church, mission, heroes, and so on.

So we suggest you actually define or redefine common terms and create a commonly understood vocabulary consistent with the central paradigm of the church. For example, use the word movement and not church to describe who you are. Why? Because most people have a very concrete idea of church; it has fixed meanings and a definite shape that isn’t always useful to developing apostolic movement. When you start calling yourself a movement, you’ll eventually begin to act like one. Also, use the phrase incarnational mission and give it real meaning (resist throwing around the term like a verbiage fad), and it will inevitably change the way you do mission in the church. If the word movement is too much for you, try using the word ecclesia and then try to live into what the Bible means by it.

But be wary of simply using trendy catchphrases. You’ve got to be intentional and use them in consistence with their meaning. Without care and intention, the words will have a negative effect on the community and weaken the ideas they represent.

4. I dentify Movemental Heroes/Exemplars

This sounds rather strange, but our heroes are those people in our world (current or historical) who demonstrate through their lives what we think is truly valuable. They live out what we all hope to be. Heroes and their stories inspire us because they reach into, and embody, the vision of what we want to be and become. Show me your heroes, and I will show you who you are! Quite literally, I can tell a lot about an organization by asking who it is the people within it deeply admire.

For instance, if your church’s hero is a brilliant scholar and preacher, well then, everyone gets the message that it is teaching, rhetoric, and scholarship that are most prized. If, on the other hand, the hero is the church planter/pioneer, people get the message that 154 Part 2 Shift missional entrepreneurship is highly esteemed. The same is true for prayer warriors, miracle workers, and so on. These are your living examples of what you are seeking to achieve. Don’t underestimate the importance of everyday heroes — they are embodiments/carriers of change, especially when empowered by the esteem of leadership.3

5. Reward Verge-Consistent Behavior

Similar to the idea of creating a hero system, this means giving social reward to those who are living in a way that is consistent with the vision and ethos of the church/organization. Again, this shouldn’t be seen as some sort of elitism, and certainly not as a manipulation of the people, but by rewarding individuals, publically or otherwise, your people will get a profound message about what your church/organization values — your ethos.

Use rituals in your gatherings — laying on of hands, telling of stories, giving of gifts, even have some sort of “People We Are Proud Of” section on the website, whatever works in your context. Distinguish those who really deserve to be singled out; otherwise this will be of little value — if everyone gets a certificate of accomplishment for their wall, then it’s of no real value. Future Traveler Jeff Vanderstelt calls this “gossiping the good stuff.” Tell the stories of success.

6. Brand Your Movement

We have to be very careful when using this term, because branding is used in a profoundly manipulative way by advertisers and spin doctors. Nonetheless, it would be naive to think that managing the “brand” (how people perceive the movement) isn’t involved in creating a healthy missional ethos in the church. The reality is that all organizations, simply because they have a distinct identity and interact through it (even if it’s just their name), have to manage how people perceive them.4 Think of a brand as a promise kept. A good brand keeps its promises, and a bad one doesn’t — it disappoints. This is a good way to think about branding: what promises are you making, and are you keeping them? Your brand is your church’s identity, and it’s the projection of that identity into the world. Ahumorous example: I use an i Phone (which I love). The problem is that in the U.S., the i Phone is bonded to AT&T, a brand which I have come to out-and-out loathe because of so many embarrassing dropped calls. I am conflicted enough to get rid of the i Phone because of the bad branding of the carrier. (By the way, this is a useful metaphor for how people feel about Jesus and the church: Jesus? Yes. Church? No.) In other words, branding has to do with how you want to be known by those coming into contact with your church/movement.

In many ways, the ethos can automatically be incubated from within.

But it would certainly not harm your cause to make sure the symbols/ words/ideas you project to the outside world are consistent with who you are and what you are all about.

7. Set Measurement Criteria

Decide what constitutes success or failure for your movement. For instance, Bob Roberts Jr. says that every church that values multiplication will measure success or failure outside its walls. Touché, Bob! This is a great clue to the missionality of the church. What we measure indicates what we value, so how we measure is very important.

Amissional measurement, for instance, might not be how many people are attending the church or the size of the annual budget, and so on, but rather it could be the extent and reach of people’s relationships into the non-Christian community. Or another example is the lowering of divorce rates in the local community. This might be a great indicator of healthy impact. And so, moving beyond the standard measurements is a useful way of changing culture.

When you mix these beliefs, values, language, identity, heroes, symbols, rituals, and measurements together, you create a very distinct culture — and culture is what people interact with. The culture in turn creates an atmosphere, the vibe that people coming into contact with the organization can feel in the ether of the community. Or to use another metaphor, the ethos is like the “spirit” of the organization.

This organizational spirit has an effect on people. In the same way that a magnetic field has an influence on various metals, the aura of your movement will impact people coming into it.

We all have experienced this: you can go into any church or corporation and somehow sense the atmosphere of the place. No one 156 Part 2 Shift has to tell you how to behave; you simply know it intuitively. For instance, we can safely guess that Saddleback Church in Southern California has a very different vibe (and invites different responses) than St. Paul’s Basilica in Rome. Likewise, Mc Donald’s emits a different vibe (eat quickly, get out) than Outback Steakhouse (stick around and work your way through the menu). In the same way, different leaders create different emotive/cultural fields. Some are stern, some creative, and so on. For instance, Nelson Mandela strikes us as a really joyous, embracing man — maybe fun to spend a weekend with. But if Adolf Hitler were alive, you’d be unlikely to want to vacation with him. (It’s all in the ethos!) An ethos thus identifies and develops the core beliefs, values, hero system, and so on and weaves them all together to create the organization’s culture and vibe. It communicates (verbally and nonverbally) through symbols, actions, and experiences what we really think and what we truly value. An explicit, well-developed ethos is crucial in determining behavior, making the right choices, developing programming, allocating resources, and setting the overall direction of the organization. (I’m pretty sure Starbucks would raise a cup to that now!)

> Verging the Vibe and Vibing the Verge

When we talk about having a Verge church ethos, we mean an ethos that is consistent with what it means to be an authentic apostolic movement. Think for a moment about the six elements: if Jesus is genuinely the center (King) of the church, then you would expect that decisionmaking and programming would be based on a prayerful commitment to referring all things to him — ensuring consistency with his person, life, and commands. If disciple-making is part of our genetic code, you would expect that the culture would communicate that; you would expect lots of language, activities, and tools that ensure that outcome.

Decision-making in a church that refers everything to Jesus ought to be markedly different from decision-making in one that doesn’t, because the church that does is held by the primary commitment at the deepest possible level to becoming more and more like him. The mDNA, embedded in the heart of the community, sets the defaults of the church to discipleship and disciple-making. And so we can see this work with all six elements of mDNA and the paradigm as a whole.

Toward the end of this chapter, we will suggest many ways in which ethos grows out of the paradigm/systems story; for now, we need to recognize the pivotal (literally) importance of a consistent Verge ethos in developing a genuine Verge church. Ethos, you see, is the pivot around which the paradigm is converted into practice; it’s the means by which the paradigm begins to take root and inform the culture of the organization. This is where the hard work of recovering the genetic basis of the church (mDNA) will begin to bear dividends; if the core of disciples and leaders are increasingly grounded in the Verge paradigm (the six elements of mDNA), then developing an appropriate ethos should be a relatively natural task.

Various Future Travelers churches have done different intentional things in order to transition into the Verge paradigm and create ethos.

For instance, Kensington Community Church in Detroit, Michigan, radically reinterpreted my book The Forgotten Ways (a rather complex leadership-oriented book) into a more simplistic “dummy’s version” and had all their small groups go through the series. At Mosaic Church of Central Arkansas (located in Little Rock), Pastor Mark De Ymaz did a long preaching series which intentionally reframed much of the language and structures of Mosaic in the process.

Recognizing the importance of shaping the imagination and thinking of leaders, Austin Stone Church started a whole missional leadership development system and process that eventually led to the church hosting one of the most missionally consistent, energetic conferences on the topic of apostolic movements. Now known as the Verge Network, it is itself the leading-edge movement cohosting the Exponential Conference in 2011.5 The growth and interest in regard to their first Verge conference, in 2010, was remarkable. With no advertising, Austin Stone had over two thousand leaders come from all over the continent, and they were sold out three weeks before the conference — a rare event for any conference, even more so in the midst of a recession.

> The Turning Point: Aligning Ethos with Paradigm

Next we will suggest examples and ways in which each mDNA in its own way can engender values, norms, and thinking that go together to form ethos. We in no way want to suggest that you simply 158 Part 2 Shift adopt these (and certainly not that you do so without serious aforethought and team reflection), because by their very nature, core beliefs and values must be owned — they must be your values. However, we do believe that some of the suggestions below would be authentic manifestations of mDNA becoming the ethos. Consider these manifestations and then use them as inspiration for your own.

## Jesus Is Lord

Remember, this is about recognizing that the absolute centrality of Jesus — the incarnation, his life, his teachings, the cross, the resurrection, parousia (his second coming), and everything in between — becomes the spiritual center around which the church ethos (and culture) orients itself. For example:

- Verge ethos = Jesus is ever-present King and Lord through the Spirit.

This will mean that Jesus must become the reference point for all decisions as well as for matters of spirituality and direction; he gets first say and the last word. Does it square with what Jesus said and who he is? If not, we don’t do it. If Jesus says don’t, then we won’t; if Jesus says do it, we’ll hop to it. He gets first say.

- Verge ethos = Christocentric monotheism. Monotheism is to theology what marriage is to relationships — you forgo all other options. Jesus is the only Lord. This will mean dismantling idolatry in all its forms — political, economic, domestic, sexual, relational, and so on. (Caution: watch for falling idols!)

- Verge ethos = holistic worship. This means broadening our notion

of worship, getting beyond the over-romanticized “Jesus is my boyfriend” songs and seeing that anything and everything (including songs, friendships, business, play, and so on) can be worship, if directed toward God. Even sex can be true worship when it is so directed! When sex is undirected by holy intentions, it is a vile, enslaving idol. Worship is simply offering all that we have and do back to God through Jesus.

- Verge ethos = nondualistic spirituality. There is no compartmentalizing faith within a Verge culture. We must help people experience everyday things as filled with holy possibility. We have to stop doing church in such a way that it sets people up to experience life as a dance between the so-called sacred and secular. All of life can be made holy — get to it.6 How can “Jesus is Lord” become the center of your church ethos?

## Disciple-Making

Disciple-making isn’t a peripheral activity; it is essential activity.

If you aren’t inviting people to a consistent life-practice of yoking themselves to Jesus, you aren’t doing what we’re meant to be doing.

Our job personally and corporately is to live in, out, and from God in Christ and to become more and more like him. With this in mind...

- Verge ethos = evaluating discipling reality. You may want to do a

constant mDNA checkup on this point. Do a discipleship audit, assessing all movement/church activities through the grid of discipleship and disciple-making. Ask, does this hinder or help people becoming apprentices of Jesus? Ask, where and how exactly are disciples being formed in the way of Jesus?

- Verge ethos = everyone is a disciple. With this ethos/value, the

church commits itself to its core task. We don’t seek to just convert people; we are committed to apprenticing them to the Master.

This isn’t for newbies only! Apprenticeship is “a long obedience in the same direction,” as Eugene Peterson puts it, and this includes the leadership of the church. Only those who demonstrate ongoing discipleship to Christ should be put in positions of authority.

- Verge ethos = helping people get back to God. Discipleship takes

place both preand post-conversion. When the mDNA discipleship informs ethos, it means that evangelism will be reframed in light of the Great Commission to disciple all nations. We begin discipling people, Christian or not, and see what God will do.7 Share the gospel, to be sure, but don’t just leave it there. We must commit ourselves to relationships and friendships, not just decisions for Christ.

- Verge ethos = what would Jesus do? This question wasn’t just for

youth groups in the nineties; it’s for everyone. To be a disciple means becoming more and more and more like Jesus. To be his disciple, study the life and teachings of Jesus often and spend time directly with him in prayer.

160 Part 2 Shift

- Verge ethos = instruction-action-reflection (repeat). When discipleship is actually ethos, then we are committed to lifelong, holistic learning, not just the transfer of information through doctrine done in the first thirteen weeks of membership classes. We need to be engaged in a cycle of instruction-action-reflection that doesn’t end as long as we are breathing.

- Verge ethos = mentoring mentors. Everyone is in an apprenticeship relationship, no matter who they are, how old they are, how mature they are, and so on. It’s a lifelong process, and you never graduate this side of heaven. For instance, 3DM leaders commit themselves to what they call “8-6-4.” Aleader disciples eight people, those eight each disciple six, and each of those six commit to discipling four — which means one leader disciples over 250 people.

How can disciple-making and apprenticeship become essential to the ethos in your church?

Missional-Incarnational Impulse This element of mDNA enshrines at our core consciousness a bonding with the theology of the missionary God (Missio Dei) and our calling to do likewise: “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you” (John 20:21).

As the Father: commits us to follow the logic of the incarnation of God in Christ.

Sent me: commits us to the idea that mission is rooted in the sent and sending God.

So I send you: commits us to follow in that way.

We are sent as the Father sent Jesus — to go deep among a group of people, to contextualize and personalize the gospel in ways that are meaningful. In other words, we are designed and destined to be a missional-incarnational people. It might look like this:

- Verge ethos = going out. Sending also means going. It means

movement of some sort — if not geographical, at least into every sphere and domain of society and into every nook and cranny of culture. No one dodges this. There is no such thing as an unsent

> Christian! We are all missionaries. It is not a profession; it’s the calling of every disciple.

- Verge ethos = going deep. This means respecting people where

they are at. Incarnational practice means being present, patient, humble, and respecting the humanity of people and people groups — their culture, their dignity, their current location in their journey toward God.

- Verge ethos = church follows mission. (And not the other way

around.) Incarnational mission demands that the church be constantly adapting to suit the context. Amissional church must be a culturally savvy church. We will constantly be inventing new ways to be the people of God in new and changing cultures.

- Verge ethos = taking church to the people. (And not just people to

church.) This means that we actually have to spend time with the ones to whom we are sent: go into their worlds, inhabit their spaces, bring good news, and be the good news we proclaim.

- Verge ethos = creativity and innovation in all things. The contextualization (incarnation) of the gospel requires this. Innovation is implied in the foundational missionary calling of the church to incarnate the gospel wherever we are.

How can you contextualize a missional-incarnational impulse into the ethos of your church?

## Apostolic Environment

This element of mDNA deals directly with the scope and potency of ministry that Jesus has deliberately laced throughout the church (Eph.

4:7 – 11). Here the ministry of Christ is being expressed through the body of Christ. As discussed previously, Jesus designed the church to have at least a fivefold ministry at its core. The current twofold version (shepherd and teacher only) violates the genetic coding of the church and creates a malformed ecclesia. It’s time to repent, change, and mature up:

- Verge ethos = ministry based on APEST callings. All of God’s

people are vocationally empowered to do the work of the church.

One of the core tasks of leadership, then, is helping people find and engage their God-given vocations as described in Ephesians 4 (see www. apest. org).8 162 Part 2 Shift

- Verge ethos = diversity of calling and gifting. Clearly, if we’re going

diversify our ministries into (at least) five forms, then we’re going to have to value and manage diversity of thinking and approach, because each ministry style (APEST) is very different.

- Verge ethos = every believer, a minister. This ethos statement

pops up all over because it’s so much part of apostolic movement thinking and practice. Note that Ephesians 4 says, “To each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it” (v. 7, emphasis added). Remember, this letter is addressed to the whole church — not a leadership conference or seminary — and the whole church includes men, women, different races and classes, and so on. It’s radical but very powerful stuff.

- Verge ethos = apostolic ministry for apostolic movement. Apostolic

movements are precisely that: apostolic. This means more than being missional; it also means that the organization ought to be focused in a distinctly apostolic way. This is a commitment to a certain way of doing church, and it differs greatly from nonapostolic forms.

How can your church recover an apostolic environment, as described in Ephesians 4?

## Organic Systems

This element of mDNA determines the organizational shape that movements adopt to achieve spontaneous expansion and high impact.

It is here where prevailing forms will possibly struggle the most to adopt/adapt, because it commits us to a more decentralized (chaordic) approach. Structures are hard to change, and they become more and more resistant over time. We have to encourage pliable structures or else suffer the consequences of religious institutionalism. Consider:

- Verge ethos = both/and. There are no points scored for trying

change the system overnight, and we certainly don’t have to jettison perfectly good ways of doing church. The way forward for most churches is to embrace the idea of being a hybrid organization composed of some centralized and some decentralized practices and structures. Keep saying “and, and, and” to yourself and your team; it will help with the stress.

- Verge ethos = adaptive leadership for adaptive structures. A Verge

church needs the kind of leadership that knows how to move a church and keep it moving. Once again, this highlights the apostolic and prophetic roles. The prophetic person will tend to call the status quo into question, while the apostolic leads with a positive vision of what can be.

- Verge ethos = high accountability, low control. This means that

while there must be a strong permission-giving culture where people are encouraged to give it a go, there should be definite apprenticeship-based lines of accountability for actions. But, as leaders, we have to overcome our seemingly innate desire to control. The Holy Spirit can and does guide his people. Don’t replace his work in the church with human power issues.

- Verge ethos = ready-willing-able. This recognizes that every unit/

agency in the organization has everything it needs to get the job done. Jesus designed the church in precisely this way. Verge church organizations work to facilitate the inherent design of the church. Remember, Apostolic Genius is latent; it’s all there. Seek to activate it.

- Verge ethos = pushing out as far as possible. In apostolic movements, both power and function need to be distributed as far out into the organization as possible. This needs to be an ethos issue, because it’s going to have to direct your movemental practices.

- Verge ethos = priesthood of all believers. Verge churches recognize

that movements require more than church planting and other “organized” activities. Every believer is an agent of the King in every arena of society and culture. The importance of this is largely missing in biblical teaching today.

How can you de-institutionalize your church to develop (verge into) a more organic system?

## Communitas

The mDNA of communitas hardwires the church/organization to ongoing learning and adaptation, to engaging in the spiritual adventure of what God is doing in the global church, and to embracing risk-taking as a necessary aspect of life, mission, and creativity. Agreat 164 Part 2 Shift example of communitas in organizations is suggested by Warren Bennis, the writer of the seminal book Organizing Genius. He says there are two essential traits of great teams: a compelling performance challenge or problem that unites the team in common purpose, and (of great importance) a sense of urgency. These are variables within the leadership mix and can be actively developed to create communitas:9

- Verge ethos = risk-taking as spiritual discipline. Risk-taking is tied

directly to ongoing learning and is indispensable for any involvement in mission. The problem is, most churches (particularly middle-class ones) tend to be safety-minded and risk-averse. We need a good dose of theological teaching about missional adventure. It’s a spiritual discipline, and it must become part of the ethos of a Verge church if movement is going to happen. I’m personally committed to doing something more risky every year I get older, just to exercise this muscle.

- Verge ethos = managing from the future. You can explore this

in more detail in The Forgotten Ways, but effectively it is an approach to planning that starts from where you want to be and works backward.10 This is what professional futurists call “back-casting,” and they use it with some of the most powerful and influential organizations on earth. The reason why this is a possible approach here is that the future creates liminal (threshold) conditions out of which communitas emerges.

- Verge ethos = mission as catalyzing principle. When your groups

are organized around ministry to other Christians, they will seldom, if ever, get to mission. If you organize the group around mission, you have to do ministry, because ministry is the means to do mission. Make sure groups are committed to something beyond their own selves and self-interests.

- Verge ethos = cultivating urgency. John Kotter, possibly the leading

writer on organizational change, says that developing urgency is possibly the most important aspect of change.11 Urgency, like the future, or a crisis of some kind, creates the conditions of learning and focuses the organization around essentials.

How can you develop communitas among the people of your movement?

## Apostolic Genius

Finally, it’s important to note again that while each of the six elements of mDNA codes or hardwires the church for apostolic movement, and that they are potent factors for change and mission, nonetheless it’s vital to think of mDNA as producing a system: the much-discussed (but ever-crucial) Apostolic Genius. When you get past thinking in one-dimensional elements to thinking systemically, then you’re really operating as a Verge church should.

- It’s the system, stoopid. Systems-thinking is a habit of mind and

a very important aspect of Verge church approach. Peter Senge calls systems-thinking the “Fifth Discipline” in a book by that name. At any point when you and others are tending to see things one-dimensionally and looking for a silver bullet, apply this discipline. Think of your own body as a system of systems (cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, and so on). It takes all to make it work. Discipline yourselves to always think of functioning wholes rather than reductionistically in disparate parts.

- Living out of the center. Again, this reiterates the importance of

constantly educating yourselves, the leadership, staff, and the church in light of the apostolic movement paradigm. Paradigms take a long time to instill; as you move from unconscious incompetence to unconscious competence (via conscious incompetence and then conscious competence), you will need to really work hard at this. Make it a matter of ethos, guide to thinking, rule of thumb, and core value to live from the determinative center of the church — from the system of mDNA.

- Thinking movements, not institution. The apostolic movement paradigm takes a while to get into our heads — that’s hard enough — but in doing that, it has to dislodge the deeply rooted institutional paradigm that has ruled our thinking for so long. Make it a discipline to think movements, not institution. If you identify yourself as a movement, and take this seriously, you will eventually start acting like one (the imperative is in the indicative).

All in all, this has been an exercise in what it means to develop ethos. When we apply it to our previous diagram, it might look like figure 17.

## Dave’s Response to “Verge Vibe:

The Operating System of Apostolic Movement” Read the following and pay attention to your reaction: The setting is the beach. You have already arrived at the beach when a man and a woman show up together. They seem like a nice couple. They appear to be new but seem to be enjoying themselves and the surroundings.

They settle in, finding a seat, and get ready to take it all in. Before they sit down, the guy takes off his shirt, and the woman strips down to her bikini.

Now, let’s try it again. The setting is your church. You have already arrived at church when a man and a woman show up together. They seem like a nice couple. They appear to be new but seem to be enjoying themselves and the surroundings. They settle in, finding a seat, and get ready to take it all in. Before they sit down, the guy takes off his shirt, and the woman strips down to her bikini.

What was your reaction this time? In the first setIn the church that ting (the beach), you probably didn’t have much of Jesus built, everya reaction. You may not have been at all surprised, one gets to play. and you probably didn’t form any assumptions — especially about their mental stability.

But what was your reaction when the same scenario took place in church? You were probably taken off guard and a little shocked. If you’d had friends with you when it happened, you might have pointed out this odd behavior or nodded to them to “look over there.” You probably would’ve begun to make negative assumptions about this couple, even questioning their mental stability.

Why do you have two different reactions to the exact same behavior when the only thing different is the setting? The reason is ethos, or culture. The beach has a culture all its own, and your church has its own unique culture. My favorite definition of ethos is this: spontaneous repeated behaviors by a group of people.

Taking off your shirt and wearing a swimsuit at the beach is a spontaneously repeated behavior every day! No one even questions it.

That’s what you do at the beach. But that’s not a repeated behavior in a church.

## Crazy Is As Crazy Does

In many churches, missional behavior would be as shocking and absurd as undressing in the sanctuary. While I was working on this, I received the following message through Facebook: I serve as a student ministry pastor.... God has been doing a huge work in me over the past six months and has brought me to a very 168 Part 2 Shift strong discontent to the way things are right now in church life.

It all began when I heard Alan Hirsch at a church-planting conference. From that point, I began to study, pray, and read about the missional movement as well reread the New Testament with fresh eyes. I have tried to incorporate what I can into the ministry in which I am serving. I have also tried to challenge our senior leadership to come alongside me and learn more about what God is doing across the world. I have unfortunately got nothing but pushback and ridicule. It’s crazy; I never would have thought that would be the case. I really believe that God is leading me to start an organic missional church that reproduces itself through the means of multiplication... almost everyone thinks I am crazy.

You can just feel the church culture clash as this young leader writes to me! So how do we introduce ideas that currently sound crazy and make them mainstream? How do we make missional engagement the spontaneous repeated behavior of every church?

> Click It or Ticket and Culture Shift

I remember hearing Erwin McManus talk about changing culture, when we were together for a leadership conference once. He explained it by talking about the mandatory seatbelt law in his state. He said, “Do you remember when seatbelt laws were implemented? If you were in any way like me, it was an absolute invasion of Every believer carries privacy! I didn’t want to buckle up. It was uncomwithin himself the fortable, it was irritating; it wrinkled my clothes, and it hampered my dating style. But they passed the potential for world law anyway. So I would only buckle up when I saw transformation. police. They were smart, because for the first several months there was a grace period where the police would pull you over and give you a warning but not a ticket. Then, over time, that grace period expired, and you were required to buckle up at the risk of a penalty.

“Today, not only does it feel wrong if we don’t put the seatbelt on, but if you see an unbuckled child in a car, your thoughts immediately turn to their negligent parents. Look how the world has changed. Our seatbelt experience as a society is an example of the successful transition in culture. We once thought buckling was absurd and an invasion of privacy; now we do it because we believe it’s the right thing to do. In fact, many of us don’t even realize that we’re buckling up. We just get in the car, strap the belt across us, and turn the key without a conscious thought.” McManus’s story is a great example of culture shift and changing the spontaneous repeated behaviors of a group of people.

## The New Normal

Here are the tools we’ve given you in this chapter: beliefs, values, vocabulary, hero-making, rewards, branding, and new measurements.

All are great for giving your church the Verge vibe and shifting your ethos toward apostolic mission. These are the best of the best for creating a new normal. These tools in the hands of leadership can create a brand-new culture that would honor and encourage my Facebook friend in his desire to start a reproducing organic missional church.

And in an mDNA culture, it would never occur to anyone that it was crazy, because all around them would be the same spontaneous repeated behavior by this group of missional folk called the church.

## Getting a Handle on Ethos

I think that any church engaging the Verge church process needs to develop an evaluation tool/discussion guide around prevailing beliefs, values, vocabulary, hero-making, rewards, branding, and measurements of their movement. They will need to ruthlessly evaluate where their current context is at, what are the current beliefs, values, vocabulary, and so on, and then hold the results up against mDNA.

One useful process that can assist here is outlined in Will Mancini’s book Church Unique.12 One of the tools thebook provides is called the Vision Frame, and it gives us a good handle on how to identify and organize the language guiding the actions and thinking of the church. To develop the language, Mancini walks through what he calls the five irreducible questions of clarity. These are:

1. What are we doing? In answering this question, the church

formally articulates mission as its central organizing principle as a missional mandate. It’s the golden thread that weaves through everything in the church. This asks questions of our 170 Part 2 Shift current paradigm, explores anomalies, and sets us on a search for answers that better fit who we are called to be.

2. Why are we doing it? The question defines values as missional

motives. Here Mancini highlights that expressing no more than four to six of your core convictions is the best way for people to carry them consciously in shaping new patterns of thinking and acting. For a Verge church, this should take us back to the core codes — to Apostolic Genius — in the search for answers.

3. How are we doing it? The final “side” of the Vision Frame is the

definition of a picture or process that shows how the church accomplishes the mission on the broadest level. This picture is called a missional map. This map, used in harness with the other sides of the frame, helps keep whatever methodology the church may be using the means of mission and not the end.

4. When are we successful? This question forces the issues of

disciple-making mission in terms of how the church defines success. In answering this question, the church leadership articulates the missional “ life-marks,” or practices, that define success. This begins to create substance around disciple-making as the core reason for being rather than the typical metrics that churches cling to in the North American context.

5. Where is God taking us? The final question of the Vision Frame

is the middle of the frame, which answers the question, where is God taking us? As a tool for articulating vision, Mancini’s model uniquely connects the practice and skill of communication to a missional reorientation on the paradigmatic level.

It can be viewed as in figure 18.

Be sure to measure the outcomes of the discussion against each of the six elements of Apostolic Genius, and this process will allow the church to develop a new operating system. The good thing that results from a process like this is that the church begins to use its own “love language,” its natural language of the heart, to articulate its own vision and ethos.

Whatever tool you might use, keep this in mind: it’s important for leadership to draw upon the prevailing sense of purpose and hopefully redeem and enrich the language already present in the church. frame missional answers irreducible question component reorientation of leadership mission m Mandate question zero What are we doing? values m Motives question hero Why are we doing it? strategy m Map question how How are we doing it? measures m Marks question now When are we successful? vision m Mountaintop + question wow Where is God taking us? proper Milestones measures mission vision values proper strategy

What company’s branding, culture, or “vibe” do you admire? What do you like about them? Are there any learnings from them that you can apply to your church?

## Explore

1. What announcements or accomplishments receive spontaneous applause at your church? What types of things do people typically celebrate?

2. Who are the heroes in your church, and why are they

celebrated?

3. In the following verses, to whom is Jesus sent? (Pat answers

are not allowed!) Cite examples from his life to back up your answers.

As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.

— John 20:21 The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.

— Luke 19:10

4. What can we learn about Jesus’ sentness that applies to how/

where God is sending us? How can you help your church really grasp that as a theological truth?

5. Where has your church already answered the call to be sent?

Do you see God making an impact through your church there?

How are those stories being told?

6. How do the examples or manifestations of mDNA help your

understanding of these elements? Which elements do you believe are most difficult to practice? Explain.

## Move

1. Find at least two heroes over the next month who are living out

Verge church mission and celebrate them publicly (weekend ser vice, elder/leadership team meeting, all-church email, and so on).

2. Review the examples or manifestations of mDNA on pages

158 – 64. Choose one example from each one of the six elements that you can put into action in your current ministry environment.

3. Decide on at least two new metrics that you will start using to

measure success.
