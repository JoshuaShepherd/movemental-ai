While fundamental, systemic, and transif t formative sea change comes from the shifting of the paradigm (activating Apostolic Genius) and through the creation of an ethos consistent with the paradigm, there is one piece that still needs to be put in place for a Verge church to emerge: the formation of defining practices.

Practices are quite literally embodiments of value — especially when they are performed by disciples of Jesus. They require the living out of values in such a way as to be observable and experienced by others. As such, they testify to what we believe and what we think is important.

In many ways, this is exactly what it means to bear witness to Jesus — to live lives observably consistent with his.

In many ways, when we are talking about developing core practices, we are really talking about a way in which the movement develops disciples on the ground. It is here where the paradigm gets to be actually lived out by adherents of the movement and/or members of the organization. This is really about active apprenticeship in the way of Jesus, but done in such a way as to express the uniqueness of any given community, movement, or organization. Discipleship will be nuanced through our distinctive ethos. Not all churches ought to be alike; each ought to be somewhat different and have a different personality, so to speak. It’s here, where the mDNA elements of “Jesus is Lord,” disciple-making, and even perhaps communitas will come to the fore. Right here, at the formation of core practices, you should experience the powerful influence of Apostolic Genius pulsing through the ethos, requiring conformity in practice to what is believed at the heart — practices are not formed in a vacuum.

Because the church Jesus designed is meant to be a disciple-making system, it should be expected that everyone in the movement has an active role to play. No one who claims faith in Jesus is exempt from the call to follow him. It should be an explicit expectation that when someone comes to faith, they immediately get involved in the church’s practices — even before they might fully understand why they are important and how they express the ethos of the movement.

As is now generally admitted, Western churches have paid way too high a price for nondiscipleship of believers. By not being intentional about apprenticing people in the way of Jesus, we’ve handed people over to be formed and developed by the prevailing cultural forces that so deeply shape Western lifestyle. The net result is that biblical Christianity has been somewhat subverted by the powerful religion of consumerism — the search for identity, purpose, belonging, and meaning in what we purchase and consume. So raise the bar here, be unashamed about being disciples of Jesus, and expect — yes expect — everyone to participate. Don’t reward mere spectatorship and attendance. Require active involvement in what it means to become like Jesus. Only in this way can we expect to create Jesus followers out of a church full of Jesus admirers.

## Inside Out and Outside In

Change, when it comes, will come from both inside out (as we change the paradigm) and outside in (as we develop practices that shape who we’re called to be). It’s vital that leaders work hard at changing the frames of interpretation by recoding the paradigm and generating ethos, but for the most part change will come as people engage in sets of practices that will change their behaviors and thinking.

To return to the computer metaphor, with its three interactive levels, practices are the programs we get to use. Most of us are blissfully ignorant of the complexities underlying the computer programs we use — of the primary codes and operating systems — we just use them.

But when we use them, we are changed. Imperceptibly at first, but irrevocably in the end. For instance, I’m so accustomed to using my computer and word-processing program, my handwriting has become barely legible — even to me. What’s more, it’s hard to even conceive of drafting a book without the aid of a word processor. (I’m genuinely amazed people could write books before personal computers!) The vast majority (85 percent?) of people in the church will be changed by acting their way into a new way of thinking. They don’t need to know the internal process and ideas that leaders need to know.

In this chapter, we’ll explore change from the outside in, but for now it’s important to see the development of core practices as the natural end result to what has gone before in the Verge church process. What we do ultimately comes out of who we are and who Jesus designed us to be.

This is the way Jesus formed his apprentices, and we shouldn’t think we can generate authentic Jesus followers in any other way.

So, guided by a core commitment to disciple-making, we will encourage you to develop your core practices, consistent with the apostolic movement paradigm and ethos, as close as we can to the way Jesus seemed to do it with his disciples. Not only are we somehow obligated to Jesus’ way of forming disciples; there are excellent reasons for adopting it in order to become a Verge church. We need to explain this in terms of worldview, but be patient because hopefully you’re about to see why developing missional practices can be a very powerful tool in the hands of missional leaders.

The prevailing paradigm of church laced throughout the West has tended to try to make disciples primarily through the transfer (mainly) of doctrinal information about the Trinity, church, salvation, eschatology, and so on. Often, it has tried to track cultural trends and engage in apologetics and evangelism, but again it has done this mainly on an intellectual level, in classrooms and Sunday school sessions. Please don’t misunderstand me here; we certainly do need serious intellectual engagement with the key ideas of our time. What is concerning, however, is that such engagement largely takes place in the disengaged and passive environment of the classroom. This is simply not the way Jesus taught us to develop disciples. And it isn’t that Jesus lacked an appropriate model of the classroom — the Greeks had developed this hundreds of years before Christ, and it was well entrenched in the Greco-Roman world. The Hebrew worldview was a life-oriented one and was not primarily concerned with concepts and ideas in themselves. We simply don’t believe we can continue to try to think our way into a new way of acting; rather we need to act our way into a new way of thinking.1 How did we move so far from the ethos of discipleship passed on to us by our Lord? Because Western Christianity has been so deeply influenced by Hellenistic, specifically Platonic, ideas of knowledge. By the fourth century, the Platonic worldview had almost triumphed over the Hebraic one in the church. Essentially, a Platonic view of knowledge is concerned about concepts, ideas, and the nature of being. The Hebraic, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with issues of concrete existence, obedience, life-oriented wisdom, and interrelationship of all things under God. It’s quite clear that Jesus and most members of the early church, being primarily Jews, operated mostly from a Hebraic understanding rather than a Platonic one.

## Figure 20

If our starting point is old thinking and old behavior, and we see it as our task to change that situation, taking the Hellenistic approach will mean that we provide information to get the person or church to a new way of thinking — and hopefully to a new way of acting. The problem is that by merely addressing intellectual aspects, we’ve failed to change behavior. The assumption in Hellenistic thinking is that if people get the right ideas, they will simply change their behavior.

The Hellenistic approach therefore can be characterized as an attempt to try to think our way into a new way of acting. Both experience and history show the fallacy of this approach. And it certainly doesn’t make disciples. All we do is change the way a person thinks, and their behavior remains largely unaffected. Even though gaining knowledge is essential to transformation, we soon discover it’s going to take a whole lot more than new thinking to transform us.

So what is that better way? We mentioned it before. It’s found in the ancient art of disciple-making, which operates best within the Hebrew understanding of knowledge. We need to take the whole person into account in seeking to transform an individual. We need to educate them in the context of life for life. The way we do this is the way Jesus asked his followers to do it: we act our way into a new way of thinking. So whether we find ourselves with old thinking and old behavior (or new thinking and old behavior), the way forward is to put actions into the equation.

The assumption is that we bring all these dynamic thinking processes with us into our actions. It’s about context, not just content. We do not, as is supposed by the Hellenistic model, leave our thinking behind when we are acting. We think while we are acting, and act while we are thinking.

At Forge Mission Training Network, for instance, we have built our entire system around this concept of action-learning discipleship.

Our twin aims are to develop missionaries to the West, along with a distinct pioneering missional Even though gaining mode of leadership. To do this, we host an internknowledge is essential ship where each intern is placed in an environment to transformation, we of mission. The vast majority of the intern’s learnsoon discover it’s going ing is by “having a go” at mission.

This to transform us. information is communicated by those who have a demonstrated capacity to actually model and demonstrate what they are teaching — in other words, they are active practitioners in their own right. As interns engage in training this way, their ability to grasp the issues, to resolve and integrate them, is significantly increased.

> From Core Values to Core Practices

Most organizations and churches have already identified what their core values are. They are then put on display on walls, in the literature, on the website, and so on. So far, so good. The problem arises in trying to actually live them out. The reason for this is partly because, as we saw in the previous section, we’ve mainly informed people’s heads and not required anything of their behaviors; all we ask is that people passively believe and not act. But the problem is exacerbated by the confessional nature of the church: when we are talking about core values in a values-shaped community of believers, it’s hard to disagree with them. Mainly because there is a Bible verse associated with each value (and who is going to argue with a verse?) but also because statements of values appeal to the head — to what 180 Part 2 Shift we believe — and don’t require much else. The common response for many would be: of course we believe in evangelism (though we hold back from it in most cases), and of course we care for the weak (even though we don’t do much of it), and of course we confess to be monotheists (even though we are all practicing polytheists). You get the idea.

The problem in churches is that mere value statements can easily become “motherhood statements,” which are preferred ideals and not lived-out values. If you don’t develop practices based on the values, establishing core values simply becomes an intellectual process rather than a compelling way to live. It’s very hard to change people’s values by referring them to a new set of values on paper and asking them to believe in them and assimilate them into their lives. So rather than simply talk/teach/lecture about ethos and values, develop many common practices which will give people mechanisms by which they can act their way into a new way of thinking. You can do this in the way demonstrated by figure 21. list posensure that sible ways in the practices select one develop a raise the list all which each selected have practice for memorable bar; expect core value can be a connection each core phrase or levels of values embodied in to everyday value acronym conformity behaviors life

## Figure 21

- If you haven’t already got a list of values arising out of the

development of ethos, we suggest you develop one (see previous chapter).

- Get people to list all the possible ways in which the value can be

lived out and observed by others.

- Review the practices to make sure they have a connection to

everyday life.

- Select just one (no more than two) practices which you feel best

embody the associated core value. Try your best to ensure that these aren’t seen as particularly religious or church-based terms and activities but are as close to everyday life as possible. So, for instance, if the core value is hospitality, then there are many ways in which hospitality can be lived out outside church walls (for example, eating meals together, visiting the sick, having a spare room).

- Develop an acronym that sums up your core values. (We’ll give

examples below.)

- Expect that members of the church/movement will somehow

practice these.

Only by raising the bar on what we currently expect of people can we expect to transform them from being consumers to being disciples.

By developing practices as a means of changing people, as well as engaging the Verge church process, you can expect change to come from both ends of the spectrum — systemic change from the Verge process (paradigm g ethos g practices), and local change from the discipleship process (practices g ethos g paradigm).2 In other words, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle. I believe that when practices are consistent with the genetic codes (Apostolic Genius) and vice versa, the apostolic movement is in full swing.

> Getting I nto the Swing of Things

Another important aspect of practice is the issue of rhythms. It isn’t enough simply to have a list of preferred behaviors. If we are to generate a distinct and living Verge culture that will infuse the movement, it is vital that we become practiced in them and do this together as a community.

Actually, this idea of living according to a common rule is ancient; monastic orders have used rules for centuries. For instance, the Benedictine rule dates to the fifth century and has over ninety prescribed practices. So what is suggested here isn’t inconsistent with the best processes of apprenticeship throughout the ages.

The difference in the Verge process is that we are seeking to apply a rule, or rhythm, not in ascetic withdrawal from others but missionally in the context of ordinary life. Jesus calls us to live out our discipleship in the context of where people live. The gospel, after all, is social force.

Furthermore, sociologists have long recognized the role that ritual plays in formation of identity, shaping thinking and dictating behaviors. For example, every Jew repeats the Shema (Deut. 6:4) at least three times a day, affirming that God is sovereign over all of life, and they always face east, toward Jerusalem, when they pray, thus physically acknowledging the role that the land has in their ongoing identity.

182 Part 2 Shift They always pray at sunrise, midday, and sunset, thus regulating their lives around predictable daily events. Also, Jewish liturgical life is built around Sabbath (the seven-day cycle) and around seasonal events.

Jewish faith is thus a thoroughly rhythmic one built around events experienced in regular cycles. There is no doubt that this accounts, in part, for the capacity of the Jewish people to survive a two-thousandyear-old dispersion in the most hostile of cultures.3 Simple rituals, redemptively constructed around natural life-rhythms and consistent with paradigm and ethos, can have profound consequences.

Perhaps the best way to illustrate what we’re saying is to describe the way it’s done by Small Boat Big Sea, the community founded by Australian missional leader Michael Frost.4 This midsized community identified a set of rhythms called BELLS. It goes like this: Core Value Practice(s) Description Represented B Bless x One act of blessing — small or big — one to Creative acts of Three someone inside the community of faith, one goodness and to someone outside, one spare to go either kindness way.

E Eat x Three All members encouraged to share table Hospitality and fellowship three times a week — one with openness with people inside the community of faith, one with everything folks outside, one spare to go either way.

L Listen one All are invited to spend at least one hour each Prayerful, hour a week week in contemplative prayer (knowing other God-attentive forms of prayer will be practiced along the community way).

L Learn Everyone is expected to (1) constantly be Lifelong learning reading and rereading the Gospels, (2) be from the Bible reading another book of the Bible, Old or and from other New Testament, (3) be reading the best dimensions of life books in any category (fiction or nonfiction, Christian or not — but only the good material). Everyone gives up trashy magazines.

S Sent Everyone experiences themselves as “sent” Missional calling into every sphere and domain of society. (sentness) in At the end of each day, they keep a journal every aspect of reflection answering two questions: (1) life. Everyone a Where did I resist Jesus today? (2) Where commissioned did I work with Jesus today? agent of the King.

The power of nesting well-designed practices together — and calling for consistency in their use — becomes really evident when you begin to see the effect it has on the community. For one, a group of twentysomethings are normally pretty difficult to organize (think about what it means to herd cats here), but when they all do the same practices week in, week out, a certain rhythm develops, and out of that rhythm a culture develops. While the bar of expectation has been raised, BELLS is by no means impossible to do. Consider this: if everyone in a community is doing three acts of blessing a week, eating together a whole lot (with all that goes on around tables), lisThe church has left tening to God, learning a lot (not necessarily always the building. It’s not so needing to be taught), and experiencing their lives as much about bringing filled with missional purpose, then I think all of us people to church as it can agree we will have a pretty healthy community!

The really wonderful thing about rhythms and reguis about taking church lar practices is that you don’t even have to teach about to the people. each value (you can, of course). People, together and corporately, will simply act their way into a new way of thinking. After just one year of this, they will be different people!

Note again, these are phrased not as core-values statements or ideas to be believed in (nouns) but rather as core practices (verbs), values that must be lived and embodied. Practices are what you see when a value is lived out by people. So when missionality is built into the practices that shape the very life of the church, it’s hard to avoid becoming missional. The movement’s heroes, like the martyrs of the early church, are those who have embodied these exceptionally well.

The best (and most comprehensive) example of practices that I have seen has been developed over many years by the ministry team of St. Thomas Crookes in Sheffield and now expounded on by 3D Ministries,5 the training and resource arm of their International movement the Order of Mission.6 These include, but go well beyond, personal discipleship to include missional, leadership, and organizational practices. They have cleverly ordered these practices around geometric shapes, each shape representing distinctive sets of practices. And while these don’t directly address the issues of paradigm, the systematic and deliberate application of these practices will profoundly shape the systemic life of the movement. Consider figure 22.

So, while the paradigm and ethos undergird everything, it is the practices that should be directly experienced by everyone — we should feel the visionary energy of Apostolic Genius and ethos, but we should see and experience the practices.

## Examples of Verge Practices

Having mapped out the process, and having attempted to demonstrate that change comes from the inside (the paradigm) as well as from the outside (practices) and that the ethos (operating system) is the pivotal piece in the equation, we will now look at an example of a consistent application of the Verge process. Please keep in mind that the examples we give are just that: examples. The apostolic movement paradigm, because it’s a deeply missional one and therefore driven to constant development and adaptation, will generate an immense amount of creativity and innovation in your thinking and acting.

That is why we’ve presented an entire section on innovation — trust me, you’re going to need to be innovative to keep up.

Also note, you don’t have to have many practices to transform the way a community behaves. For instance, BELLS is only five practices combined in an intentional rhythm; allowing life to be shaped by them inevitably means the community will be changed. Develop sets of practices/rhythms for different arenas of the life of the movement.

Leadership practices should define the life of leaders (that is, all should mentor others in a sustainable and reproducible ratio, all should model innovation). Apprenticing practices, as we’ve seen, should be designed 186 Part 2 Shift to include everyone in the movement. But be willing to change and adapt throughout. Simplexity is the key!

Some Distinctly Disciple-Making Practices Action Learning Action learning is the commitment to learn from life and from events as they happen. It’s focused on the present and bringing learning into the equation. It’s a brilliant leadership tool, used extensively by Jesus, and ought to be in the fabric of church life.

Agreat example of teaching people the art of action learning and reflection comes from 3DM’s Life Shapes, which we’ve already touched on. It’s based on Mark 1:15, where Jesus says, “The time [kairos] has come... the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news.” Life is seen as a line from Ato B (fig. 23); the kairos (the kingdom of God) happens in the midst of life and forces reflection. kairos moment life from point Ato point Bact observe repent account reflect believe plan discuss

## Figure 23

## Here is what figure 23 looks like in your life:

- Observe. What happened, and how did you react/feel?
- Reflect. Reflect on your observations. Why did you feel the way

you did? What does that say about you? Is there a pattern?

- Discuss. Seek the wisdom of others. Do your observations and

reflections make sense? Do you discern an opportunity for growth?

- Plan. Figure out a practical way to grow.
- Account. Tell somebody about your plan and ask them to follow

up with you on it. How successful will a diet be if you don’t tell the people you eat with?

- Act. Do it!7

Baptism Is Commission; Conversion Is Ordination The core movemental idea that everyone is a minister of Jesus Christ has come up time and again. We suggest that one of the ways in which the unbiblical and missionally disastrous division between clergy and laity can be overcome is by recognizing that when someone becomes a follower of Jesus, they are commissioned into the ministry.

It isn’t an elitist profession. They might not all become “leaders” and work with other Christians, but it’s vital for them to see themselves as players in the equation.8

## APEST: Basing and Phasing

This phrase “basing and phasing” comes from 3DM’s practice of Ephesians 4 ministry. Once the primary (or base) ministry is clear and on a pathway of development, disciples are encouraged to learn the dynamic of the other ministries by experiencing them (for a phase).

So, for instance, if someone has a base ministry of teacher, they should deliberately learn the work of an evangelist, even though it will not likely become their main ministry. This way, disciples get to empathetically experience all aspects of the ministry of Christ through his body.

Some Distinctly Organizational Practices Thinking Like a Beginner and Not an Expert Stemming from the mDNA of communitas, and mediated through the ethos of adventurous spirituality, risky mission, learning organization, and the pressure of innovation, we should always be willing to put ourselves out of our comfort zones. All of us are masters of our current domain of knowledge, so we always approach issues like an expert. The trick is to learn to think like a beginner and not an expert.

The way we do this at Forge Mission Training Network, for instance, is to define the learning project for the year. Once this is 188 Part 2 Shift clarified, we then suggest that people go to the edge of what they feel is comfortable — where they are 50 percent expert and 50 percent beginner. Then we say go another half step out of your comfort zone, where you are 75 percent beginner and only 25 percent expert. Now you are ready to really learn. It’s an easy and excellent practice to keep people learning and adapting.

## Multilevel, Multisize

As an outworking of the both/and (inclusive) nature of Apostolic Genius, a Verge church will practice church of all sizes (organic/simple, midsized, megachurch, multisite) and will seek to find a way to organize at every level.

> Context-Based Learning and Training

One of the most powerful and simple practices is to apprentice people in their primary context, where they have to live the practice(s) out. Most of the learning we do is in the context of classroom-type environments or through sermons and books. Christianity can’t avoid being conceived as being primarily theoretical when the primary way we teach is through books and study. When learning comes into my life-context, it changes everything. The simple rule should be that context is everything.

## Innovate

In a Verge church, which is always seeking the new edge and is committed to being a learning community, innovation should become a core practice and not just a core value. This means that basic skills of innovation should be taught and that permission should be given to all to try new things. It should then be expected that when people propose new ideas and projects, they have more than one model of how they intend to do it, and don’t simply do what others have done.

## Multiply or Bust

The core value of multiplication, when it’s embodied into practice, will mean there’s a possibility of multiplication in everything we do.

It means that if it can’t be easily reproduced, it should be seriously questioned as a project/task. The questions that should constantly be asked as part of this practice are, can this be readily reproduced, and by whom? (And if not, why not?) As mentioned in chapter five, 3DM teaches what they call 8-6-4, in order to multiply mentoring (see p. 160 ). This is easily done and ensures that the commitment to mentoring and discipleship is written into everything. Organic church movement leader Neil Cole similarly teaches that inherent reproducibility is vital for movement, and he is right.9 In Church Multiplication Associates, everything that cannot be easily reproduced is put on what they call “the shelf of shame.” Some Distinctly Missional Practices Planting the Gospel To help live out our paradigmatic commitment to incarnational mission (mDNA element: missional-incarnational impulse), a simple practice for people is to practice planting the gospel and not see what they do as planting “churches” per se. Questions that can be asked here are: What is good news for this person or people? What is going to sound like good news to him or her? This commits the planter to be very attentive to the Jesus factor, people’s existential issues, and also the cultural situation of the people being reached. Missionaries first ask what is good news for a people group and then communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ in ways that fit.

## Church Follows Mission

This practice flows directly from the one above. Because the church in the West is now in a context that demands a more distinctly missionary approach, we will have to learn the practice of starting with the gospel and not front-loading our idea of church in the equation. This takes practice and will require discipline, because we normally do church planting by placing a prefabricated model of church in the equation. Teach people to ask (and answer) this question in the context of mission: “What is church for this people group?”

## Church in Third Places

Apractice I have found very helpful is to try to get your groups and church-plants away from safe or sacred spaces and out into social zones, or the third place between workspace and home. One, it’s very 190 Part 2 Shift missional to be church in places where other people are, but it’s also a good discipline because context forces contextualization. It’s pretty hard to resort to default singing and mini-preaching in the middle of a café when others are around! The practice? Start groups in third places and not in homes.

> Jesus for/with/of the Community

A good way to think of incarnational mission is to assess the depth of identification with the host community. Reflect on the depth of Jesus’ care for people and on how we represent his love. See it as Jesus for, Jesus with, and Jesus of the community. The way love is shown is by full identification. Jesus is for, with, and of the community. Ask yourselves these same questions: Are you for, with, and of the community? Commit yourselves to be the Jesus of, for, and with the community people. The folks at River Tree Christian Church take this very seriously.10 So much so that Future Traveler Greg Nettle, the senior leader, moved out of the comfy suburbs and into the urban center of the church’s community to demonstrate this! They also use this practice to guide all their mission efforts at home and overseas.

Mission As Organizing Principle If evangelizing and discipling the nations lies at the heart of the church’s purpose in the world, then it’s mission (and not ministry) that’s the true organizing principle of the church. The truth is that groups which come together around a nonmissional purpose (for example, prayer, worship, study) very seldom, if ever, end up becoming missional. It’s only those groups that set out to be missional in the first place (while embracing prayer, worship, study, and so on in the process) that actually get to doing it.11 At South Melbourne Restoration Community, the church my wife, Debra, and I led for fifteen years, we developed a set of five discipling practices called TEMPT.12 The Mat the core stands for mission, and we maintained that unless the group had one, however they conceived it, it couldn’t start. In fact, my general advice to what is called the emerging church is simply this: don’t emerge until you’ve got a mission. If you take the mission out of the equation, all you get is a lot of talk about spirituality, theology, and worship.

## Network Like Mad

This principle of church can become an extremely powerful practice. We know from networking theory that it not only bolsters the relational fabric of the church and forms the basis of decentralized movements but also is the source of much innovation and creativity. So the practice of networking — getting everyone connected, everyone commissioned, and everyone accountable — can be powerful if you can figure out ways to enshrine it in the rhythms of the church.13

When key leaders ensure that Apostolic Genius is (re)activated at the core, and all leaders collaborate in developing a Verge ethos consistent with it, then (inspired and informed from deep within) these leaders can go on to design powerful rhythms and practices that they can trust will profoundly shape the life of the emerging movement.

Deep change therefore comes from the center (the paradigm) as well as the circumference (the practices).

> Dave’s Response to “Embodying MovementProgramming Practices”

I can tell you from personal experience that practices are vital to shaping and informing the culture of a movement. With about ten thousand people considering Community Christian Church, which I pastor, to be their church, the burning question that keeps repeating itself over and over in my mind as we Verge is, how do you mobilize ten thousand people for mission?

The idea of movement is not new to us. Our dream since the very beginning was to be a “catalyst for a movement of reproducing churches.” And, indeed, we are a church that reproduces Christ followers, groups, teams, campuses, churches, and even networks, but we have not always been deploying all of God’s people for mission. At one point, we realized there were literally thousands of people who were a part of Community who weren’t missionally engaged. We now know that if we want a different outcome, it requires change.

We are at the humble beginning stages of engaging in the very process that was laid out in this chapter. If we at Community are going to change our paradigm, it will require a change in culture, and for that to be sustainable, it will need to infiltrate the everyday practices of our people.

The current established cultural practices at Community came from our study of Scripture and the early church over a decade ago.

We concluded that there were three relational experiences that were primary to followers of Jesus. Those three relationships could be summarized in these experiences: Celebrate: the relationship between God and us. The first experience of the early church community is “celebrate” and is described in Acts 2:46 – 47 (NLT): “They worshipped together... each day... [they] shared their meals with great joy and generosity — all the while praising God.” The celebration between God and his people was a gathering to worship but was also an everyday part of community life. We encourage all people to celebrate their relationship with God when they come together and every day in Scripture.

Connect: the relationship between the church and us. The second experience that characterizes the kind of community God longs for in his people is found in the word connect. The first church community was unequivocally and tightly connected to one another and to God. So connected, the Bible says, they were together every day: “Every day they continued to meet together” (Acts 2:46).

Contribute: the relationship between the world and us. The third experience that characterizes this community is “contribute.” Acts 2:44 (NLT) says they “shared everything they had.” Verse 45 adds, “They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.” This was a group of people who could stand up and say, “If you’ve got a genuine need, we will help you.” If you’ve ever been to Community, there are a couple things you will come away knowing for sure. The first is our mission, which is helping people find their way back to God. The second is the challenge for every person to become what we call a “3C” Christ follower. We say it with clarity and we say it often: we want every person to become a 3CChrist follower. We even created our own data management system, called 3CMS, that tracks if someone is a 1C or 2C or 3CChrist follower. On a weekly basis, a dashboard tells us how every campus is doing (and how we as a church are doing) in regard to the three experiences: celebrating, connecting, and contributing.

While these practices had been tremendously helpful to date, we knew that in order to shift to a more grassroots movemental paradigm, we had to make changes to these expected practices of a Christ follower, community groups, and campuses.

## Christ Follower Practices

The challenge we had given to be a 3CChrist follower was measured solely on participation within the realm of Community Christian Church programming. You might be reading this and thinking, “Seriously? You guys are stupid!” And you’re right!

With a new passion to mobilize people for mission in every domain of life, we knew that had to change. We made a subtle (but important) shift and began to affirm and count the contribution of that business owner, the stay-at-home mom, and many others who were being intentionally missional outside our church campuses and programming.

## Communal Practices

We wanted our communal practices to be consistent with the individual practices, so we recast the vision for our small groups. In the past, we were content if these small groups became cul-de-sacs of assimilation. Again, it was our passion to mobilize all people for mission, so we challenged every small group to fall into one of two categories:

1. Agroup on mission. These groups would come together around

a missional cause. One group we have is called the Hammerhead. This is a group of guys who gather primarily on the weekends and help people in need with home repairs. What draws this group together is the missional cause of using their handyman skills to make a difference in Jesus’ name.

2. Agroup of missionaries. These groups would come together

around an affinity for each other. This could be a moms’ group or parents-of-teens group or a support or a recovery group. We’ve had lots of these groups for many years, but the big adjustment was that they could still gather based on affinity; they simply had to covenant to hold one another accountable to engage in mission outside the group.

It was our intention, through these new categories, that we would establish new practices in our small groups and thus develop a new missional culture. To ensure that groups of missionaries were establishing new practices, we asked those affinity groups to follow this monthly rhythm:

- Week 1: Connect with each other
- Week 2: Mission to the 67 percent of the world who are far from

- Week 3: Connect with each other
- Week 4: Mission to the 20 percent of the world who live on less

than a dollar a day We are still in the process of experimenting with this monthly rhythm, but early indications are that these practices are helping us in making this shift to mobilizing all God’s people for mission.

We seriously contemplated a name change for our small groups, to call them missional communities. We decided against Mission is that for a couple reasons: First, the name “missional community” sounded too much like insider talk to an worship and average non – church attender, and we’ve always been worship is able to reach lots of people far from God through our mission. small groups. (We definitely didn’t want a name that was a turnoff.) Second, we were reticent to just declare that all our small groups were now communities with a mission, if in fact they were not! We wanted to make sure that the groups made that shift and that we didn’t just rename them as they were.

## Campus Practices

Athird change we made regarding practices was in regard to what we expected from each of our campuses. For the last several years, we had laid out annual expectations for each campus, which involved setting actual and specific percentages — much like a budget — of church attenders we expected to celebrate, connect, and contribute individually (our 3 Cs). We in fact laid out an annual expectation that only 50 percent of our church would be involved in contributing.

But with a new understanding that contributing could (and should) happen in all domains of life and not just within churchrelated programs, we are shifting the expectation of contribution to 100 percent. Anything less seems foolish.

It’s still too early to know the outcome of these changes. My gut and my experience tell me these will produce gains, but not enough.

We will need to make other shifts. But I am sure of this: we aren’t 198 Part 2 Shift content with 50 percent of our people engaged in Community Christian Church programming; we want 100 percent engaged in mission.

We will only let our hearts rest when we meet the vision that Jesus had for his church: a genuine move of the Spirit mobilizing every follower into every domain of life for the sake of the mission.

## Discussion Questions Open

What is one practice you are thankful you added to your life? What is one practice you want to eliminate?

## Explore

1. Does your church typically carry out change from the inside

out (paradigm shifting) or the outside in (changing practices)?

Or in some other way?

2. “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the

name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:19 – 20).

Which of the practices Jesus used in developing disciples are you currently applying in your church? What’s missing?

3. What are three common practices of discipleship/mission in

your church right now? Are there any you need to let go of, that aren’t contributing to producing the kind of disciples you’re desiring? Any you need to add?

4. “Baptism is commission; conversion is ordination.” What do

you think of this idea? Do you think your attenders believe it?

Why or why not?

5. Assess where you’re at on incarnational mission. Do you think

people in your community see Jesus as being for them, with them, or of them?

## Move

1. <!-- Page 180 --> Alan challenges us to create a list of values that

arise from the development of ethos, or culture. He then suggests a series of steps to develop practices that reflect these values. Take sixty minutes and walk through these steps in rapid-fire fashion as a way to get you started. Then, when you have more time, work with a leadership team and follow this plan to bring about lasting change in your current ministry.

2. If you haven’t yet, have your team take the APEST test (www. apest. org). Then, as Alan suggests, find practices to help you grow in the roles of fivefold ministry that don’t represent your main role.
