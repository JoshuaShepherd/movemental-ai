## I nno v a te o r Di e

The Japanese character for “crisis” is a combination of the characters for “danger” and “opportunity” (or promise); crisis is therefore not an end of opportunity but in reality only its beginning; the point where danger and opportunity meet; where the future is in the balance and where events can go either way. — DAVID BOSCH, MISSIOLOGIST hus far, we’ve laid out the foundations for the

Verge church by describing the vision (imagif t ine) for what the church must become to survive, exploring the core transition process (shift), suggesting that we refound the church based on Apostolic

Genius, developing the ethos (or operating system), and developing practices that are consistent with the whole system.

So far, so good. But this all begs the question of how. As has been hinted at all along: to become apostolic in nature, the church will simply have to learn how to innovate.

Crisis Is the Birthplace of Innovation If you really want to see innovation happen, find a crisis. It’s in the middle of a crisis that we come to the realization that either the end is near or a new future is being born. On the verge of a crisis, we are also on the verge of our greatest moment. It’s at that moment that we must decide: innovate or die.

There’s no doubt anymore that the church of the West is clearly in some form of long-term, trended decline that is now reaching critical level — witness the demise of Christianity in Europe and Australia, for instance. Furthermore, the number of people who will be in a church in the United States has shrunk to just more than 18 percent, the lowest level in the history of a once very religious country. And if that isn’t alarming enough, we need only look to the major cities of the U.S., where leading cultural indicators are birthed. In these, only 10 percent of the population attends church. This is just a precursor to what has already taken place in Australia, where less than 10 percent attend church, and Europe, where no more than 2 percent of the population will participate in church life this weekend. We have a crisis, which is going to necessitate something very drastic.

> Necessity, the Mother of Innovation

The leadership at Community Christian Church knew they had a crisis. They also recognized that this was going to necessitate something very drastic. Community had seen nineteen consecutive years of growth, and for the majority of those years it was double-digit growth.

So when we projected an 18 percent increase in income for the coming year, it was nothing out of the ordinary. But then it happened: the bottom fell out of the economy. Week after week there was a shortfall — first thousands of dollars, then tens of thousands.

The bigger the plane, the bigger the hole it makes when it crashes, and Community was now a very big plane with a financial hole that was getting bigger every month. Over the next several weeks, budgets were slashed and we were forced to let staff go. Six months into the new fiscal year, we were five hundred thousand dollars short of our projections. This called for something drastic!

In the middle of this brutal situation, we decided as a staff to spend a day in prayer and fasting, asking God what to do. We were a church used to moving at full speed ahead, and we really weren’t sure what came next. We wondered, “Do we slow way down? Should we back off the vision? Should we flatline the budget?” On Tuesday we fasted, and on Wednesday we regrouped over a meal and debriefed what we had heard from God. I stood in front of my team, reexplained the crisis, thanked everyone for fasting and praying, and then asked, “So what do you think God is telling us?” There was a lot of silence.

Then more silence.

Finally Steve, an IT specialist, spoke up and said, “I know we are in a crisis, and I know this won’t make sense in our current economic climate, but I don’t think God is calling us to shrink the vision; I think God is calling us to expand the vision.” What Steve said was not what I expected. It wasn’t what most of us were thinking. But God was doing a new thing, and we decided to move forward in faith. So in the middle of this crisis, we did something everyone thought was crazy: rather than shrink the vision, we expanded the vision. This new vision was not about the shortfall or just the ministries behind the walls of a Community campus. The new vision was a dramatic missional shift toward what we called the Sixty-seven and the Twenty. If the world were a village of one hundred people, sixtyseven of those would be far from God, and twenty of those would live in extreme poverty. How could we be more attentive to people who were even worse off than we were, spiritually and/or materially? With this shift in direction, we challenged all of Community to a weekend where rather than keep the money that was so desperately needed for 206 Part 3 Innovate the budgetary life of our church, we would give away everything that came in to four outside causes: a ministry that saved kids living on the streets of San Pablo in the Philippines; a ministry that worked to eradicate poverty in a Ugandan village; a local effort to bring community transformation to an underresourced community; and the support of new churches being planted in the United States.

The result? When we finished counting the offering, it was by far the largest offering ever. (It was almost double the highest giving up to that date!) In the middle of a financial crisis, Community gave away $250,000!

My first reaction was, we just gave away $250,000... awesome!

But my second reaction was, we’re way behind in our budget and just gave away a quarter of a million dollars... that kind of stinks! But God knew what he was doing. Not only did Community give away $250,000 that year; the following year we gave away $490,000, and the year after that nearly $600,000 on a single weekend! And in the three years since that crisis, our generosity has exploded! In the middle of what appeared to be our most desperate hour, God was doing something new to advance his mission! Innovation gave birth to God’s purposes in our church.

Innovation: Most Risky or Least Risky?

Before innovation can take place, we must have a clear understanding of what we are discussing. Most of us think of innovation as the Introduction of something new or different, requiring a “Innovation is the great amount of courage and risk. While that is partly least risky rather true, Peter Drucker offers some contrarian thinking in than the most his classic Innovation and Entrepreneurship: “Innovation risky course.” is the least risky rather than the most risky course.” — Peter Drucker And he is right. If Community had not gone through a paradigmatic shift that expanded our vision to include the 67 percent and the 20 percent outside its walls, this missed opportunity could have been the first of a series of organizational heart attacks leading to complete cardiac arrest. It seemed risky. It sounded crazy to give away the entire weekend’s offering when there was no human way we could afford it. But looking back on it now, it was the least risky course. We had to listen to the Spirit’s prompting: it was innovate or die.

Drucker also gives us this ho-hum definition of innovation that sucks most of the fear out of innovating: “The shifting of resources from areas of low productivity and yield to areas of higher productivity and yield.” That is why innovation is so important for the mission of Jesus. It isn’t just so we can be on the cutting edge or part of the next cool thing. Innovation is critical for the mission because it allows us to steward our resources, our people, and our very lives away from low-yield kingdom activities to high-yield kingdom productivity.

> Imagination × I mplementation = Innovation

Innovation isn’t synonymous with imagination, nor should it be confused with creativity. In the last couple years, some creative new ideas have been introduced in the marketplace under the banner of innovation, but I’m not buying it. Let me give you some examples.

There is the inflatable dartboard (very creative, but it’s hard to imagine it working well after the first dart is thrown).1 Or how about airbag underwear? It’s underwear that can sense when you’re about to fall and automatically inflates.2 It sounds ridiculous. (I’d rather have a Clapper installed to turn my appliances on or off with a simple clap of my hands.) Or how about lawn mowing shoes?3 Sounds too dangerous to me! These products are creative but not innovative.

While the starting point for any Verge church is the missional imagination of the community, that alone will not accomplish the mission. Innovation is what happens when a Verge church moves from imagination and makes the shift toward apostolic movement. Innovation is imagination put to work. Imagination is all about ideas and dreaming, but innovation is about implementing the ideas and beginning to live out the dream. Scott Belsky’s presentation from his bestselling book Making Ideas Happen inspired the equation in figure 25.4 imagination × implementation = innovation 5×0=0 100 × 0 = 0 3×2=6

Lars Kolind, in Second Cycle, tells us that organizations fifty years ago could have one good innovation and milk it for decades. Today, with the exponential increase of technology and information, he suggests that the life cycle of new innovations is typically six to twelve months. Then it becomes necessary to adapt and innovate on the previous innovation. So we need to switch from a battleship mentality of holding our ground in the ever-changing tides and waves to a surfing mentality. We have to be catching waves all the time. And, as much as we might resist it, that wave we catch will die rather quickly. So we need to paddle out and find the next wave to ride. A Verge church recognizes that our era is not just a time of crisis but also a season of unprecedented opportunity. An apostolic movement thrives on innovation, knowing that God is doing a new thing. When this new thing comes to fruition, it is first and foremost because it’s being guided by a leadership that values and practices innovation.

> Leadership That Values and Practices Innovation

“If this church disappeared tomorrow, I wonder if anyone in the community would even notice?” All the other church leaders around the table were silent as they pondered the question. Conviction had walked in on the noontime meeting. It was a question they had all heard asked rhetorically in sermons, but they’d never heard the question asked sincerely by one of their own. This pastor was in a crisis. The church he was leading was in a crisis. And this was not the kind of crisis that comes from too few nickels in the offering plate or too few noses showing up on Sunday. “If this church disapThe pastor, the asker of the profound question, peared tomorrow, had planted this church several years earlier, and all I wonder if anyone the graphs were up and to the right. It was not that kind of crisis. It was instead a crisis of mission. Despite in the community the brand-new building and all the new attenders, the would even notice?” pastor said out loud what many wondered deep within: if my church disappeared tomorrow, would anyone even notice?

About twelve months later he resigned as senior pastor of the church he’d founded twenty years before. Acouple months after that he started working in sales, and a few months after that he and his wife divorced.

I guess he answered the question.

The church itself may have been healthy according to institutional standards, but the question of whether anyone would notice betrayed the lack of connection between what was going on in the world and what was going on inside the church walls. The pastor made a choice to abandon his work to irrelevance rather than try to change the answer.

Innovate or die — it isn’t just an ecclesiological issue; this is a very personal issue for every leader. Verge churches will be led by leaders who settle for nothing less than trading their lives for missional impact. These leaders know the importance of not only engaging every follower’s missional imagination but also putting that imagination to work through innovation that changes lives and leaves a lasting impact on a community.

How about you? Will you dare to ask and answer the question, if this church you are a part of disappeared tomorrow, would anyone in the community even notice?

Don’t fear the crisis. It is in the midst of crisis that we are on the verge of something grand and brand-new. It’s at that moment that we must decide: innovate or die.

There are three key descriptors of a leader on the verge.

1. A Verge Leader Leads from the Front, Not the Back

There is a saying in the military that generals who lead troops from the safety of the rear should have to take it in the rear. Jim Kouzes says it this way in The Leadership Challenge: “Only those leaders who act boldly in times of crisis and change are willingly followed.” One of the best generals I know is my brother, Jon Ferguson. Jon and I launched Community together and have seen it grow from a few friends to thousands at eleven locations all over Chicago. Jon is also the strategic mind behind New Thing, a reproducing church movement which now has more than one hundred churches and sites around the world. It would be easy for him to feel a sense of accomplishment and decide to take some time off and kick back a little. He could rationalize that he has done his part and it’s somebody else’s turn to step up, so he can back off. Heck, he could call it a sabbatical!

But Jon is the kind of general who is leading the missional charge from the front. Rather than settle into a nice suburban home and spend his time telling old stories at workshops and conferences, he and his wife, Lisa — along with their two kids — recently moved into the city of Chicago to start a network of new sites for Community. He is leading the charge with dozens of others who are moving from the safety of the suburbs into the adventure of urban life. He is leading the way and asking others to support this important initiative by either moving with him or helping out with their finances. He’s recruiting a team of leaders to bring what he imagined to life. Jon is the kind of innovative leader people want to follow and imitate.

This kind of leadership isn’t restricted to vocational ministry, nor is it isolated to the church building. These leaders pull others through this shift with them to the front lines rather than pushing from the back office. These leaders will emerge in every domain of society: economics, health, science, journalism, communications, the arts, agriculture, government, and finance. They’ll do the good work that God has prepared in advance for them to do in all walks of life, giving leadership to a missional movement. We’re seeing the firstfruits already.

Perry Bigelow, president of Bigelow Homes, isn’t the kind of CEO to just sit behind his desk and bark out orders to his people.

Perry is a missional leader who leads from the front, not the back.

When Bigelow Homes built Home Town, his vision was to build neighborhoods of genuine community, where kids are safe to play, the environment is honored, and a church would be present to serve the people. He described his intentions like this: “I want to build a community the way the Master Carpenter would build it.” Perry not only shared that vision with his company and challenged them to complete it; he moved into one of the Home Town neighborhoods himself and works every day to see that vision fulfilled. In addition, from the profits of Home Town, Bigelow Homes makes very generous donations to Home Aid and Hope International. As a result of Perry’s leadership, Bigleow Homes was named Builder of the Year by Professional Builder magazine. The cover story read, “Doing Good by Doing Right.”5 This wasn’t surprising to anyone who knows Perry. He’s always been someone who leads by example, not vague dictates. When he saw a need for quality housing for single moms in the city of Chicago, he started a nonprofit company that built condos specifically for single working moms with school-age children. He not only built these condos but moved out of his suburban home and into one of the condos for seven years.

Do you lead from the front? When you lead from the front, every decision you make and action you take is for the sake of the mission.

For too many of us, ministry has become a job and not our life’s mission! When your ministry becomes a means to get what you want instead of a means to accomplish what God wants, there’s no way the mission will be accomplished. Too many leaders are looking for a fatter paycheck, a bigger church, and early retirement in a better climate.

The apostle Paul led from the front. That’s why he could say, “I urge you to imitate me. For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church” (1 Cor. 4:16 – 17). He felt confident enough in the mission that if others would just follow his lead, the mission would be accomplished. In fact, Paul felt confident enough that he was sending Timothy to lead them, because he knew that he had apprenticed Timothy and that if they just imitated Timothy’s life, they could accomplish the mission.

I think every leader should answer this question: if the people who follow you just imitated you, would they accomplish God’s mission?

2. A Verge Leader Leads with Curiosity, Not with Certainty

Albert Einstein was such a genius that when he died, Thomas Harvey, the coroner who did his autopsy, stole his brain, reasoning that it needed to be put into the hands of experts who could figure out the key to Einstein’s brilliance.6 But Einstein’s brilliance wasn’t to be found in his brain. Before Einstein died, he left behind his own understanding to the secret of his genius, saying, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” We believe the same secret is true of innovative leaders: they are passionately curious people.

There is no doubt that vision is essential to leadership and that “a leader cannot blow an uncertain trumpet.” 7 Aclear and certain vision is a given, but what makes a leader special is an accompanying unquenchable curiosity. The one who can lead with the crystal-clear vision of a general and still maintain the curiosity of a child is a special leader and will foster innovation in the people around him or her.

But beware. It’s often our successes that cause cataracts to develop over our curiosity and eventually blind us to future successes. It’s often the very thing that made us successful that later causes us to stumble and fall. The more successful a church is, the happier they are with the way they are currently doing things. So the megachurch which is growing can feel sure that what they are doing is the real recipe for success and just increase what they are doing in hopes of continued success. Success can be built from even one unique innovation, or just a small number of them, within a church, and a church’s monopoly on those innovations can give them that sense of having an edge. The contemporary/mega/multisite church has been that innovation which has created successful growth within that 40 percent “market.” But our very success in those areas can blind us to the possibility of movement that is waiting for us beyond the scope of those particular innovations.

So be curious. Pursue your questions. If we have the faith of a child, shouldn’t that include a wonder about where God is working in our world? Go on a God hunt. Snoop. Hunt. Probe. Certainty about the vision is not enough for the innovative leader; it requires a constant questioning and curiosity about what new thing God is doing next.

> Few contemporary leaders have been as innovative or curious as

Peter Drucker, known as the father of modern management. Drucker spent thirty years studying innovation in both the for-profit and notfor-profit sectors, and he tells us where not to look and where to look for innovation. He says, “Do not just look for the biggie, the innovation that will revolutionize the industry.”8 When you think of innovation, don’t think of yourself as trying to be the Wright brothers, discovering flight. Instead look for changes right around you that have already occurred and are under way. Drucker identifies several sources for innovative opportunities around every one of us. Here’s where a curious leader should begin to look:

## Unexpected Success

The Austin Stone Church grew rapidly in the first several years of its existence and created small groups in which the focus was on creating community to get the growing number of people connected to one other. But they struggled getting people connected, and it seemed the more they focused on community, the Change the less genuine community people actually experienced. Yet metaphor, and when they put out the challenge for serving, people would you change the show up in droves. They couldn’t explain this unexpected success, but over time it started to make sense. imagination.

Matt Carter, lead pastor of the Austin Stone Church, describes the surprising discovery they made about small groups: “When we aimed simply for community, we got neither community nor mission. But when we aimed for mission, we got both community and mission almost every single time.” Michael Stewart, who oversees their missional communities, explains: “We told people, ‘If you aim for Acts 2 community, you will experience real community,’ but what we mission. It was this unexpected success that set this church in a whole new missional direction.” The Austin Stone Church now has more than three hundred missional communities, and they are just getting started.

Where are you seeing unexpected and unanticipated successes in the life of your church? What leaders, groups, or events seem to succeed despite very little funding or attention from staff? As you look to the fringe and rogue efforts on the periphery of your community, who is making an impact and seeing changed lives? Those are the places a curious leader will investigate to discover what God is doing next.

## I ncongruity

Afriend of ours was working with a church in the Atlanta area, helping them on a plan to reach young adults. The assumption was that people’s entry point into the life of that church was through a weekend worship experience. When they did interviews with the young adults in that church, they discovered a big surprise: a huge percentage of the young adults first became aware of the church through their participation with a local chapter of Habitat for Humanity. There was an incongruity between what the leadership perceived to be true and what actually was. They believed that young adults would need to be a part of the community (weekend worship ser vices) before they would join the cause (service through the church), but instead they discovered just the opposite: being part of the cause brought them into the community.

Have you discovered any inconsistencies in how things are versus how you perceived them to be in your ministry? Have you noticed blips on the screen of your own observations that are incompatible with how it “ought to be”? If the answer to either question is yes, you may be on the verge of a tremendous advancement — the perfect place to pry and snoop for innovation.

## Need

The needs are there. Hugh Halter and Matt Smay remind us in AND: The Gathered and Scattered Church, “Understand that God has been at work weaving together Spirit-led thoughts, dreams and kingdom innovations in a city, in a neighborhood and in the life of every person you’ll meet.”9 Before Matt and Hugh started their church, Adullam, they made it their simple goal to make fifty friends. They discovered what we all discover when we become a real friend: real needs. They found people who need help getting (and keeping) jobs. People who need help with their marriages and their kids. People with drug dependencies and codependencies. Since then, Matt and Hugh have launched Missio,10 a training network to apprentice others to engage with their own unique context and find needs that can be met.

Where are the needs in your community? Can’t answer that? Take a look at your local paper over the last month, and the needs will be revealed to you in black and white. Compassion by Design11 works with curious leaders and churches by showing them how to conduct a needs assessment of any community. Curious leaders will find needs in the arts community, the public school system, the local government, or the parks and recreation department. The next innovation can be as easy as finding a need and meeting it.

## Opportunity

Bill Barton of the I nstitute for Community12 heard opportunity knocking on the door of apartment communities. They realized that apartment communities have a goal of about 95 percent occupancy and that retention (getting renters to renew their contract for another year) was the key to their financial success. It caused Bill to put together a kingdom-minded mission called Community Life. Bill asked apartment managers for one of their already-vacant apartments, where he would place a Community Life Architect in exchange for the promise of increased retention rates. The Community Life Architect, motivated by the gospel, would work to create genuine community that accomplished not only the mission of Jesus but also the goals of the apartment manager. Marquette Properties agreed to pilot this program, and the first apartment community not only saw increased retention rates but also had higher rates than any of the other twentysix properties within the company’s portfolio. In the next three years, the Community Life program expanded to ten apartment communities, with a goal of one hundred by 2015.

Opportunity is similar to need, but the motivation is not desperation, abandonment, or lack of resources. Opportunity knocks because a unique partnership can emerge, or the gifts and skill set of a group or individual are needed to bring improvement. Curious leaders will sniff out opportunities, and when they follow the scent, it leads to innovation.

## Changing Demographics

For some leaders, a changing demographic is a sure sign to relocate or to move out of the neighborhood to a more familiar setting. For the curious leader, a change in demographics is a signal to begin probing for innovative opportunities. To Rick and Desiree Guzman, the influx of new refugees into their neighborhood brought about Bryan House,13 a mission to bring community transformation through home ownership. Through the generosity of Bryan House, supporters’ funds are raised to purchase homes where refugee families, who can’t afford a home, will pay rent for eighteen months. During that time, the rental money is put into an account and returned after one and half years to the family so they can make a down payment on their first home.

When new artists start moving into a depressed community, this is the first sign that economic redevelopment is coming. Curious leaders coming alongside those artists can help in the redemption of that neighborhood. Running or retreating from change is like pretending tomorrow will be 1980. It won’t. The curious leader knows that tomorrow will be different from today and that difference will providentially bring the opportunity for innovation.

## Changes in Perception

Amathematician would tell you there’s no difference between the glass being half full or half empty. But a curious leader knows there is a difference in these two ways of thinking, and the difference is found in their consequences. If a general perception shifts from seeing the glass a certain way to seeing it another, a major innovative opportunity presents itself.

September 11, 2001, was a day that dramatically changed people’s perception of their personal security. On September twelfth of that year, people felt scared, angry, vengeful, and afraid. Just two days before, on September tenth, they had very few of those feelings. What changed? Asingle catastrophic event.

Were we really less safe on September twelfth than on the tenth?

Probably not. In fact, because of heightened attention to national security, we were actually safer on the twelfth. What happened was a change in perception. With that change in perception regarding personal security, there came a tidal wave of spiritual searching and a huge influx of people into churches — often people who hadn’t been in church in years. That change brought about an innovative opportunity to help people see that the only lasting peace and security is found in Jesus. Unfortunately, most churches missed that opportunity.

There are constant shifts in mood regarding the economy, political landscapes, and perceptions about the future. Peter Drucker tells us, “Whether sociologists or economists can explain the perceptional phenomenon is irrelevant. It remains a fact. It is concrete; it can be defined, tested and above all exploited.”14 The curious leader isn’t as concerned about whether the glass is half full or half empty as about the perception of others about the glass and the innovative opportunities it brings.

When we think of a curious leader and innovation, we might imagine him or her with Wired magazine in one hand and the Bible in the other, discovering some new technology that revolutionizes how church is done in the future. That’s how we might imagine it, but it’s seldom how innovation actually happens. The curious leader should recognize that very few will ever be the Wright brothers, but lots of us can be right when it comes to seeing the next innovation, if we look at what God is already doing right around us. So snoop. Hunt. Probe.

Above all, remain curious.

3. A Verge Leader Leads with a Yes and Asks How Later

Time magazine compiled a list of the ten best commencement addresses ever.15 This list included speeches by Winston Churchill (Harrow College, 1941), John F. Kennedy (American University, 1963), and even Steve Jobs (Stanford, 2005). Also on the list was Stephen Colbert (yes, that Stephen Colbert!) and his 2006 commencement address at little Knox College in Galesburg, I llinois.16 Colbert, whom Knox had just awarded the honorary degree of doctor of fine arts, closed his address with a challenge about the power of saying yes: When I was starting out in Chicago, doing improvisational theatre with Second City, there was really only one rule... When you improvise a scene with no script... you have to accept what the other improviser initiates... Well, you are about to start the greatest improvisation of all. With no script. No idea what’s going to happen, often with people and places you have never seen before. And you are not in control. So say yes. And if you’re lucky, you’ll find people who will say yes back. Now will saying 218 Part 3 Innovate yes get you in trouble at times? Will saying yes lead you to doing some foolish things? Yes it will. But don’t be afraid to be a fool.

Remember, you cannot be both young and wise. Young people who pretend to be wise to the ways of the world are mostly just cynics. Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it. Because cynics don’t learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness, a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us. Cynics always say no. But saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow.

Saying yes leads to knowledge. Yes is for young people. So for as long as you have the strength to, say yes.

> You may or may not like Colbert’s politics, but either way, if you
> want to be an innovative leader, you’d better listen to his words of

## Yes Reflex

The one thing every leader possesses (that every follower needs to make his or her own missional shift) is permission. And permission always comes in the form of a yes. Leaders, if you want to see missional engagement in your churches and ultimately a movement, you must lead with a yes. If your followers can’t get permission from you, they will never be engaged in the mission. The great temptation is to respond with questions of how. But questions of how need to wait. If we respond with, “How could you do that?” we immediately begin to sow seeds of doubt by responding to the individual’s vision with a question about strategy. If we ask, “How much would that cost?” we are responding to their vision with a question of tactics. The questions about how will come later, but the reflex of an innovative leader needs to be yes.

Jordon Prosapio, seventeen years old, and John Macikas, eighteen, were both totally fired up after the winter Blast retreat. The challenge was given to them at a student ministry retreat from the life of Peter to “step out of the safety of the boat” and, in faith, engage in the mission of Jesus. They heard it and began to imagine the difference they could make. As high school students, they came to the leadership of their church with the idea of a Food Fight. What? Food Fight: Students Fighting World Hunger.17 What a great tagline! But what could two high school students really do? What could two kids accomplish in the global battle of hunger relief? Rather than asking how, their leadership responded with a yes. That yes led to people of influence and affluence getting behind Food Fight. The yes led to a great marketing campaign donated by the premier ad agency in Chicago. The yes led to civic leaders getting behind this initiative. And what has transpired since getting a yes to this totally student-led nonprofit over the first two years has been absolutely amazing! The first year, they enrolled 1,200 students at two high schools to raise $17,000 and pack almost 100,000 meals for the hungry. In the second year, 3,000 students at five high schools raised $30,000 God is already and packed nearly 200,000 meals for people in Haiti. involved in mission The old paradigm many churches are built upon to his lost world; was borrowed from the business world, and it says you you can join him. need to know your target group, understand the niche of your brand, and say no to anything that isn’t within that clear focus. This is a great business strategy for developing a highquality brand with deep penetration into a specific market segment.

It’s a money maker. But it’s not a movement maker! Amovement requires a clear set of core values and a leadership with a yes reflex to many different kinds of ideas and to many different kinds of people in many different disciplines, all moving forward for the same cause!

Furthermore, if the church is genuinely informed/propelled by the mDNA of missional-incarnational impulse, it means we’ll feel the deep drive to keep searching for new opportunities to plant the gospel and integrate new groups into the broader movement. While local expressions of ecclesia can and should be focused on certain groups, given the multicultural context we all live in, we cannot remain monocultural in the movement and be true to the church Jesus wants us to be.

## Democratize Innovation

Let me be clear: Yes doesn’t mean you will fund the idea. And in most cases, you absolutely shouldn’t fund the missional ideas of others. You may do more harm than good. Yes also doesn’t mean you’ll assign a staff person to oversee it. Sometimes that makes sense, but 220 Part 3 Innovate often it will not. Yes doesn’t mean it gets announced at a weekend celebration ser vice. Yes doesn’t mean it gets space on the website. Verge churches know that ministry doesn’t have to happen “on campus” or be announced on Sunday to have tremendous missional value. Yes simply means you really do believe that what they are describing is needed, and by using their giftedness with God’s help, it could be accomplished for the good of the Jesus mission.

We need to develop a yes reflex. If someone comes to you and says, “I got this idea about reaching kids through sports.” What do you say?

“Yes.” If someone says, “I want to care for HIV patients.” What do you say? “Yes.” If someone says, “I want to help provide support for single moms.” What do you say? “Yes.” Ayes reflex leads a coup d’etat against the clergy-only, campusbased form of ministry and ushers in the democratization of innovation and creativity for the kingdom of God. Ayes reflex acknowledges that God may use even kids like Jordan or John or a boy named David from the Old Testament. Ayes reflex is verbal manifesto that says to every follower of Jesus that they have a much-needed role to play in the mission of Jesus.

At the risk of sounding like a street evangelist, all signs are telling the church in the West that the end is near. A Verge church knows they must choose between ongoing innovation or ultimate death/ demise. Innovation is the byproduct of leaders who personally set the pace, are chronically curious, and give permission to all God’s people to play a part in God’s great mission. While we are on the verge of a great crisis, we are also on the verge of our greatest moment. So it is right now that we must decide to either innovate or die!

> Alan’s Response to “Innovate or Die”

Pastor and innovator Erwin McManus had an interesting experience while being interviewed on the radio. It was a major show with a large Christian leadership audience, and the subject was on innovation. He was second in line to be interviewed. The person being interviewed before him was an extremely influential leader, and his advice to the listeners was that they shouldn’t attempt to be innovators, that innovation itself was too risky and the odds are stacked against people who try out new ideas. Instead his advice was that they should be early adopters. They should take the innovators’ ideas and improve on them.18 This placed Erwin, who clearly belongs to that more creatively restless 2 percent of the population called the innovators, in a very difficult situation: what could he now say without directly contradicting this senior leader? So when the interviewer turned to him and asked what he thought of the issue, taking a deep breath, Erwin asked what would happen if everyone took Pastor X’s advice to avoid the risk of innovation and opt to be good early adopters instead.

Well, the answer is obvious, isn’t it? We would have no innovation!

And without innovation, we’re unable to advance our cause or create new possibilities. In other words, without innovation, as Dave has noted, we die. And this is a poiPaul goes into Thessagnantly real truth at the dawn of the twenty-first lonica, gets kicked out century, when Christianity faces decline in every nine days later, and Western context. he still calls them an In The Forgotten Ways, I suggested we face today what is called an adaptive challenge. There are basiecclesia of God. Now cally two times when adaptation and innovation are that’s church planting! appropriate: in the face of a threat or in the face of compelling opportunity. In other words, one is an adapt-or-die scenario, and the other is “change because it really benefits you to do so.”19 The adaptive challenges we face are in many ways real opportunities to rediscover some world-changing potentials lying mostly dormant in God’s people. In fact, feeling a real threat or engaging new opportunities are the sweets spots for innovation. They are the “burning platform” out of which much learning emerges. When productive agitation runs high, innovation thrives and startling breakthroughs can come about.20 Disruption can be a blessing.21 Movement theorist Steve Addison notes that in order to fulfill their mission, the most effective Christian movements in history are prepared to change everything about themselves except their core beliefs. Unencumbered by tradition, movements feel the freedom to experiment with new forms and strategies. Hence they are natural innovators. Movements pursue their mission with methods that are effective, flexible, and reproducible, outlasting and even surpassing the influence of the first generation of leaders. Furthermore, he notes that innovation enables a movement to function in ways that suit its changing environment and its expansion into new fields. Following Collins and Porras (Built to Last), he notes that “a movement’s commitment to both its core ideology and to its own expansion provides the catalyst for continual learning, renewal and growth.” And importantly, he goes on to say, “Dying institutions display the opposite characteristics — willing to sacrifice their unique identity, conservative in setting goals, and unable to face the reality of their mediocre performance.”22 I doubt that churches who find themselves in such situations like the state of affairs very much, but they should take the advice General Eric Shinseki gave to Donald Rumsfeld: “If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less.”23 “Change before you have to,” Jack Welch, one-time CEO of General Electric, tells us. We have to feel the need before we will change.

The truth is, learning and innovation actually work hand in hand.

It’s foolish, indeed dangerous to the missional cause, to think that what was successful yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow. If we engage in a blue ocean strategy — and I believe we have to if we are to engage the 60 percent of the population that is increasingly alienated from our prevailing expressions of church — then we simply have to innovate. This doesn’t mean we should abandon what we’re doing now, but it does mean we must learn what we don’t know now and not just use the same tools, approaches, and methods that work in the red ocean. What got us here is unlikely to lead us there. In other words, we need to learn to fish in the blue ocean. It is patently clear that what works in and among the 40 percent of those reached by conventional church forms won’t work for the 60 percent of those unreached. Respond, innovate, adapt, learn! Innovation will lead you into the new (and blue) waters. Innovation, inspired by the internalized fires of Apostolic Genius, is a precondition for growth.

## Discussion Questions Open

When have you been the most innovative? What was the crisis that preceded it, and what was the outcome?

## Explore

1. Opportunity abounds in crisis through the power of imagination. What was the crisis in the following passage, and how did the early church use imagination to solve it?

The congregation in Antioch was blessed with a number of prophet-preachers and teachers: Barnabas, Simon, nicknamed Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen, an advisor to the ruler Herod, Saul.

One day as they were worshiping God — they were also fasting as they waited for guidance — the Holy Spirit spoke: “Take Barnabas and Saul and commission them for the work I have called them to do.” So they commissioned them. In that circle of intensity and obedience, of fasting and praying, they laid hands on their heads and sent them off.

— Acts 13:1 – 3 MSG

2. What are other examples of innovation in Scripture?
3. If your church disappeared tomorrow, what kind of impact

would that have on the rest of your community?

4. “And so this is good-bye. You’re not going to see me again, nor

I you, you whom I have gone among for so long proclaiming the news of God’s inaugurated kingdom. I’ve done my best for you, given you my all, held back nothing of God’s will for you.

Now it’s up to you” (Acts 20:25 – 28 MSG).

In Paul’s final moments with the church of Ephesus, he boldly proclaims that he has given them his all and that he is worthy of being imitated. If those you lead simply imitated you, would God’s mission get accomplished? What would get accomplished? What wouldn’t?

5. Are you a curious leader? Using the list on pages 213 – 17, how

might your community be primed to innovate?

6. What was your response to the concept of leading with a yes?

What obstacles might you face if you developed a yes reflex?

How can you implement this type of leadership immediately?

## Move

1. Based on your answers to question 3, who do you need to meet

with to learn more about how God is moving in your organization/church? Schedule a meeting with that person.

2. Lead with a yes today! Take the first step and release someone

with your verbal affirmation. If it’s hard, do it again and again until you get the hang of it!
