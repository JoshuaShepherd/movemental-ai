# Preface

You may be wondering why we have called this book Reframation. Well, in this made-up word, we are drawing attention to the idea that each of us sees everything through a frame. Whether it be God, creation, people, the good news, or the call to mission, each and every “picture” we encounter is surrounded by a frame, and that frame in some way determines what and how we actually see. Our goal in sharing what we as authors have been learning is for us all to consider what it might look like to put some new frames around these pictures: to reframe our understandings of God, people, and mission.

In what we hope is obvious to the reader, the title is also something of a play on the word Reformation … as in the major sixteenth-century revolution that shook the Western church. This wordplay is intentional as we want to lovingly reinvoke (and playfully reframe) one of the central mottos of the Reformation, known simply as semper reformanda, which states that, "The church reformed ought always to be reforming, according to the Word of God."1 We somewhat cheekily propose our own version called semper reframanda and suggest that, "The church reframed ought always to be reframing, according to the Word of God." Just as the church needs to engage with ongoing re-form-ation, we believe a continual reframe-ation is similarly required. Every new context the church finds itself in necessitates a reframing of theology and gospel, so that it resonates with contemporary culture. As Helmut Thielicke noted,

> The gospel must be proclaimed afresh in new ways to each generation, since every generation has its own unique questions. The gospel must constantly be forwarded to a new address, because the recipients are constantly moving, not just geographically, but philosophically and spiritually as well. It is therefore essential that the gospel be proclaimed and received afresh.

> IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING, YOU MUST FIRST LOVE IT

The missional church conversation has made it abundantly clear that this book will highlight the deep concern we both have for the church.

However, let there be no misunderstanding—we really do love Jesus and his people, and both of us have given our lives to serve the body of Christ.

It is because of this we feel called to address the frames through which we, as the church, view God and his world. In our opinion, evangelicalism, the theological tribe we hail from, has often displayed spiritual, moral, and theological bankruptcy in its portrayal of God and gospel over the last few decades or so. It’s likely the same critique can equally apply to other sectors of Western Christianity as well.

From what we can discern, the core of the problem is that the church does not sound or act a whole lot like our Founder, Jesus. Evangelicalism in particular seems to have arrived at a form of “Christless Christianity,” in which Jesus is celebrated as Savior but rejected as Lord.3 As a result we have ended up with a gospel that excludes the necessity for discipleship. In addition to this, we have lost the disciple’s sense of responsibility to actually embody (incarnate) everything that our Founder and Lord represented and taught. Even a cursory reading of the Gospels indicates that Jesus himself would never allow people to bypass his sovereign claim on their lives. He clearly taught that to be a follower and a disciple required death to self, submission to his lordship, and a decision to grow in increasing levels of conformity to his own life and teachings—a life of love, humility, servanthood, forgiveness, justice, holiness, and mercy. When we have arrived at this point, a form of Christ-less Christianity, we can be sure it is time for a reframation.

This apparent Christlessness is all too readily confirmed by the very people to whom we are called to be witnesses in the first place: across the Western world, Christians are often perceived as being unloving, grumpy, and at times even a hateful people. How do we possibly square this with the kind of witness that Jesus called us to embody and represent? How is it that the very people who claim to have experienced the amazing grace of God can have such a narrow application of it when dealing with others?

When we have arrived at this point, a graceless faith and witness, it is time for a reframation.

None of this is new, of course. Reductionisms (for that is what they are) have plagued religious people ever since there have been religions. Consider the Jews of Jesus’ day; they made exactly the same mistake—reducing God, people, and world into religious formulae and legal code. They were Preface xxv unable to see what God was doing in Jesus. As a result, they missed the very Person that everything in their difficult history as God’s chosen people ought to have formed them to recognize … and this blindness remains true to this day. As a Jew, I (Alan) lament this deeply! When we have arrived at this point, a place of cramped religion, it is time for a reframation.

If we follow the Jesus-logic, “you will know a tree by its fruit” (see Matthew 7:16–20), we can safely assume that any organization is perfectly designed to produce the fruit or outcomes they are currently producing.

Applying the same rationale, we conclude that if what we offer to the world is a grumpy and constricted belief in God, then it is probably because we have a grumpy and cramped view of God in the first place. Something is deeply wrong with our fundamental conception of God here! When we have arrived at this point, a place of a profoundly reduced experience of God, it is time for a reframation.

## About The Authors

It has taken us over four years to complete this book, partly because the themes within its pages are so very personal to both of us, capturing something of both our spiritual journeys over the last decade. This book is a collaboration, and as in all such partnerships, we both bring a unique contribution to the common voice. It is perhaps worth briefly introducing ourselves and some of our reasons for spending so long in the process of writing.

I (Alan) have been in various forms of formal ministry for around thirty years now. The first fifteen years involved local church leadership, church planting, developing missional training systems, and denominational renewal. The latter fifteen have been primarily spent on the International scene, pioneering the development of missional forms of church, largely within Western cultural contexts. I have written extensively on topic and have had the privilege of serving God's people in many of the major denominations and organizations.

What has gone into the writing of this book has been intensely personal. In some ways it has been a means for me to try to resolve a serious existential faith crisis, precipitated by some of the reductionisms stated above. The last four or so years have involved a very painful reassessment of my own evangelical heritage. I have sought to work out why so much of evangelicalism seems to be so utterly impoverished from the roots up. In this book I have tried to identify and name much of what I perceive to be the causes for this spiritual bankruptcy. I ask the reader to please receive my observations in the spirit I offer them … in humility before Christ … as one confessing my own sins and complicity in it all. But, thankfully, I do believe there are some key ways to address the problem—there is hope, but it will require repentance and reframation.

Those concerned about the orthodoxy of what they are about to read, need not worry. Ironically, I now feel more deeply grounded in the historic, orthodox faith than I have at any other point in my life. I totally believe!

But I believe in a bigger and deeper way now—I’ve been duly reframed and continue to be so. I can honestly say I have grown in my understanding of God, people, mission, and gospel as a result. T. S. Eliot’s words, always among my favorite, have never seemed truer …

Similarly to Alan, I (Mark) have been engaged in full-time ministry for over thirty years. I’ve progressed slowly through a vocational path that has included youth ministry, ministry on a university campus, and for the last dozen or so years, launching and leading a faith community in the city center of Knoxville, Tennessee.

I have come to recognize that giving myself in community alongside so many others trying to participate in a movement to restore all things has been a beautiful gift. The oft-quoted words of Frederick Buechner describe well my experience for the past three decades: Preface xxvii the kind of work God usually calls you to is the kind of work (a) that you need most to do and (b) that the world most needs to have done [...] The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.5 The writing of this book is, in some ways, a culmination of these last thirty plus years lived in this very intersection of my “deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger.” In fact, the “new frames” phraseology, the very idea behind a reframation, has been a part of a specific calling I have been drawn to for a long time. It has played itself out in a variety of ways in my life, in many artistic forms (theatre, storytelling, preaching, and teaching) but has always come back to this urgent call to be a part of a great reframing of the beautiful story of Jesus. Again, this book is intended to bring much of this experience to fruition.

Each stage or season of our lives hopefully teaches all of us new and transformative truths, things we could never have fathomed earlier in life.

This has often been confirmed in my own life as I continually find myself repeating the phrase, “I have learned more in the last ten years of my life than in all the previous years combined.” This particularly describes my past few years, and this book is part of the fruit of that education, which I am desperate to continue.

As Alan has described his healthy obsession with von Balthasar, I too have had my share of fanboy influence from the aforementioned writer, novelist, poet, preacher, and theologian Frederick Buechner. It is Buechner’s skill at reframing the sacred, whether through fiction, memoir, or sermon, that has drawn me into a wider and deeper experience of God that continually takes my breath away and causes my “heart to leap” and my “eyes to fill.”6 Alan and I both believe, at least partially, that it is this odd combination of these two great thinkers and writers that brings a broader depth and breadth to this book, that might otherwise have been missing.

## A Matter of Style

Speaking of key influences, the reader will quickly discern that we use C. S. Lewis heavily. Both of us have always loved Lewis, but we have found him particularly useful in the writing of this book on reframing; his suggestive use of imagination, poetry, myth, and spiritual longing, as well as his profound reflections on the nature of heaven and hell, are so pertinent to the themes we explore. We use him extensively because we x believe there is something of an implicit missiology in his approach that is critical for us, as evangelicals, to understand and apply in our mission and witness within our current context. His form of apologetics goes beyond the overused rationalistic techniques to appeal more directly to the more immediate existential registers that reside deep within every human heart.

We believe we all need to follow in Lewis’ footsteps; in doing so, we will not only connect with contemporary culture but also reflect more of the way of Jesus, who always speaks directly to the human heart.

Furthermore, the reader will find we quote from an unusually wide range of sources (Judaism, religious poets, pop culture, and arts) and we draw from within the broad Christian tradition (Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox). We are deliberate in doing this. If we simply spoke as evangelicals and quoted only evangelical insiders, we would only confirm the linguistic frames and the theological blind spots or biases we already have. We need outside voices to wake us up to the treasures we already possess but fail to understand, let alone access.

We have also drawn ideas from beyond the Christian realm to illustrate that the search for transcendence really is universal and is expressed through various philosophers, poets, and mystics—be they Christian or not. We do this not because we don’t believe in the priority and authority of the Scriptures in all matters of faith (we totally do), but because we want to show that the issues the gospel addresses—the longing, the yearning, and the ongoing attempts to make meaning—are built into the universal experience of all humans. These longings are keys to the human heart and therefore we can (and indeed must) begin to speak into these to find cultural resonance. We need to attune ourselves both to God and to the real issues of our time in order to bring a faithful witness to bear.

We both have a common love of great theology, poetry, story, and mystery.

This isn’t simply because we are so very tired of the small, domesticated, churchly god of pious platitudes, but because literature engages and forms the human imagination, allowing knowledge of the head to become knowledge of the heart. Knowledge therefore ceases to remain theoretical and instead becomes integrated into our whole life.

As lovers of all things God, we have kept our hearts in a state of holy restlessness in a search for a God big enough to change everything. We refuse to settle for the initial, partial experience of God we had when we first came to believe. We seek to know God as he wishes to be known … through ever-expanding and enchanting frames, through eyes of wonder and love, believing with Augustine that, “If you understand, it is not God” Preface xxix (Si comprehendis, non est Deus). God is ever greater, always bigger, than anything we think we know of him.

This holy restlessness, the kind that leads to a reframation, is laced throughout this book. Our hope is that you will feel somewhat disturbed, challenged, and stretched throughout. As Frank Kafka writes, If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to … A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us.7 In order to highlight the idea of the framing/reframing theme, we are going to sometimes play around with words in a way that allows for a doubletake, two-frames-at-once kind of experience. So, for instance, we will play with words such as “wi-l]der,” “in/credible,” “w/holiness,” “re/enchanted” etc. It’s a literary trick we devised to make you read the sentence twice, each time in a different frame.

Another quirk of this book is the extensive use of endnotes. We do this largely for two reasons: first, to give those interested a deeper exploration of the particular line of thought referenced. If an idea piques your interest and has an endnote, we trust that this will lead you to greater insight. But because it is an endnote, it ought not to hinder the flow in the main text.

The other reason for using endnotes is that we want to provide proper references to the many resources we have found useful. While this is not intended as an academic text, we do want it to be a substantial (as well as a fruitful) one.

We fully realize our own limitations as we write. In trying to expose some of the Western church’s most dangerous reductions, we have become all too aware, as two middle-aged, middle-class, white guys, how our own thinking is greatly reduced. So much of Protestant thinking, certainly that of evangelicals, is left-brained, functional, and technical; many of our problems in perception have arisen from a form of theological dysfunction or “exaggerated male brain syndrome.”8 We have very much been on a liberating journey of learning and of correction in this regard. W/holiness is a wonderful thing.

This book is not intended to be directive and formulaic; however, we do want to point you, as fellow followers of Jesus, lovers of God, and seekers of his glory, to what we think will lead to a greater, more Christ-like way to be his people in the world. What we very humbly offer to you are potential x pathways by which perhaps, by God’s grace, we might see and experience more of God in every aspect of our lives—individually and corporately. We hope as you engage with the words in this book, not only with your mind but also with your heart, that you will somehow become a little more like Jesus and a better representative of his good news.

I ask him that with both feet planted firmly on love, you’ll be able to take in with all followers of Jesus the extravagant dimensions of Christ’s love.

Reach out and experience the breadth! Test its length! Plumb the depths!

Rise to the heights! Live full lives, full in the fullness of God. God can do anything, you know—far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams! He does it not by pushing us around but by working within us, his Spirit deeply and gently within us. Glory to God in the church! Glory to God in the Messiah, in Jesus! Glory down all the generations! Glory through all millennia! Oh, yes!

## Ephesians MSG

The good news comes knocking on doors that we didn’t even know we had; it flings open the curtains on windows we didn’t know existed to reveal the rising sun flooding the room with glory when we had imagined that all light came from candles; it woos our cold hearts and awakens them, like someone falling in love for the first time, to a joy and fulfillment never before imagined.
