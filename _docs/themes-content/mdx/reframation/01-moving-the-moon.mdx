# Chapter 1: Moving the Moon

## (A GOD GREATLY REDUCED)

The greatest heresies do not come about by straightforward denial; most of the church will see that for what it is. They happen when an element which may even be important, but isn’t central, looms so large that people can’t help talking about it, fixating on it, debating different views of it as though this were the only thing that mattered.

## — N. T. W R I G H T

Alas! the world is full of enormous lights and mysteries, and man shuts them from himself with one small hand!

## — RABBI YISRAEL BAAL SHEM TOV

> If you comprehend God, he is not God. A comprehended God is no God at all.

## — THOMAS AQUINAS

In his book, The Eclipse of God, Martin Buber points out that a solar eclipse is something that concerns the relation of our eyes to the Sun, rather than a movement or changing of the Sun itself. Although an eclipse appears to impact the Sun, in fact it has no influence on it at all.1 Seen from the perspective of Earth, a solar eclipse is caused by the Moon moving between the Earth and the Sun and therefore blocking all or some of the Sun from Earth’s view. Similarly, an “eclipse of God” occurs not because God moves away from our sight, but rather because objects, ideas, and idols insert themselves into our viewpoint, obscuring our capacity to view God in all his fullness.

## The Eclipse Of God

We now understand that after a short period of time the Sun reappears at the end of an eclipse, as the Moon moves out of its path. But our understanding has not always been this advanced. Primitive beliefs viewed an eclipse as an apocalyptic event. As the darkness came upon the people in the middle of the day, and as they saw the Sun disappearing and felt the cold breezes starting to surround them, their limited understanding caused them to believe that the Sun had died and the world was ending.

Although this is an inaccurate scientific interpretation of a solar eclipse, there is metaphorical significance in suggesting that a world that has lost connection to its radiant Sun (God) is a world that is ending, and that it is a dark and precarious place.2 The eclipse (or concealment of God) is therefore a powerful twentyfirst-century metaphor because it explains so much about the struggle we face to know God. The eminent philosopher Charles Taylor talks about the secular West as being trapped in what he calls “the immanent frame”— meaning that we find ourselves enclosed (framed) within a view of the world that locks out the possibility of transcendence. Our awareness of God is therefore obscured and eclipsed, and we find ourselves cut off from the enchanted, theistic, sacramental worldview that has been lost in the last three centuries or so.3 The process by which we arrived at this unfortunate state has been considerably analyzed by some of our greatest thinkers.4 In summary, it is the net result of the confluence of cultural and intellectual forces that have been growing for the last 500 or so years and have snowballed in the middle to late twentieth century.5 Rather than pointing creation toward their Source, a host of influences, including ideologies, events, idols, and people, are in fact obscuring a culture’s awareness and perception of God.

And this fading of God from human consciousness has been catastrophic.

Benjamin Mann, a one-time atheist, now a Catholic priest, laments:

> God’s eclipse means the loss of an infinite horizon, and its replacement
> with a purely finite sphere: in which our freedom has no higher goal or
> reference point, principled values are indistinct from mere preferences,

Man was never meant to live in such a world; he cannot make sense of it, or make sense of himself within it. Yet this—despite the persistent personal faith of a great many individuals—is the kind of world in which we increasingly live our common life.

Moving the Moon 5 The crisis of the modern world is not primarily its moral disorientation— which is serious, but largely symptomatic. Nor is it the loss of specific, traditional religious faith—which is also alarming, but is really one part of a greater whole. The crisis of the modern world is the “eclipse of God.”6 The issue is not just a loss of traditional religious faith and a declining church but a more profound loss of our whole sense of transcendence, our spiritual instincts, and our consciousness of the divine. It is a growing blindness and deafness to the Eternal, and we find ourselves tragically limited to the horizon of this finite world, such that we “no longer grasp the ‘transcendent’ character of our ‘existence as man.’”7 People (both in the church and out of it) increasingly lack the plausibility structures to make sense of faith in God, or their place in the world. Seminal British missiologist John V. Taylor names those who reduce every vertical to a horizontal, all language to the literal meaning of words, and all relation with God to a relation with others, as “contemporary flat earthers.”8 This loss of a sense of the divine can be traced to numerous cultural forces prevalent in our day, such as:

- the ever-present secularism as a dominant worldview that eliminates

religious expression (Taylor’s “immanent frame”)

- the philosophical atheism that has dominated the arts and science

over the last 120 years

- the specializing tendencies of scientific methods that reduce a total

vision in order to study the parts

- the rampant materialism that has very effectively supplanted the role

of religion

- the anti-religious bias of psychology and the social sciences
- the pervasiveness of capitalism and the associated market forces that

inevitably reduce people to economic units of consumption

- the domination of depersonalizing technique and data, and
- the polarizing political propaganda that we are subjected to every

day.

It’s no wonder people can’t seem to find God—so many things have moved in to obscure our vision.

As a result of the coalition of these and other forces, we now see the world as an object to be categorized and consumed—a significant move away from the premodern perception, which considered the world to be the realm of the sacred. In many ways, it is this shift in perspective that has destroyed the opportunity for intimacy with an eternal, ever-present God. God is still here (he never moved); it is we who have lost our sense of spiritual attunement. God is revealing himself to us but our senses are blunted, and we no longer have the eyes to see him. God is speaking to us but we have lost the ears to hear him and lack the language to respond.9 When an animal can only hear certain ranges of sound, or a man is color blind, it is not that the sound or the color is absent, but that there is an inability to perceive. So it is with the silence and speech of God: we can no longer “see” (recognize) or “hear” (respond to) God. We have little in terms of common language or concept within which to frame a true knowledge of God. The real problem at this moment in history is that God is “disappearing” from the human horizon. Consequently, the light that comes from him is dimming, and humanity is losing its bearings, with increasingly destructive effects.10

## The Great Reduction

Alongside the eclipsing of God, there has been a corresponding loss of the whole due to a focusing on the parts. In other words, we have lost a sense of the big Story that makes sense of all our little stories. It is this loss of wholeness that contributes to the eclipse, concealing and alienating us from the truth of the one God—and it is this loss of the whole that lies at the core of heresy.

In its original meaning, the word heresy does not infer that someone is wrong or has believed a falsehood. Rather, it simply refers to a particular truth or belief that has been extracted from its true and complete context and is subsequently treated as if it were the whole truth. This explains why every heretic in the history of the church has had a verse or two of Scripture they rigidly hold to. Or, as N. T. Wright notes:

> The greatest heresies do not come about by straightforward denial […]
> They happen when an element which may even be important, but isn’t
> central, looms so large that people can’t help talking about it, fixating on
> mattered.11
> that has been lost, ignored, or suppressed. That is something to get excited
> Moving the Moon 7
> and sectarian by making the newly-recovered particular truth into the
> greater Truth from which it has been extracted.12 Truth thereby becomes

The poet Rumi lamented this shattering of truth: The Truth was a mirror in the hands of God.

It fell, and broke into pieces.

Everybody took a piece of it and they looked at it and thought they had the truth.13 Heresy is not exclusive to theology and religion. If we look into just about every other domain of knowledge, we can see that this sort of reductionism affects everything. For instance, it happens when ideas—be they theological, political or sociological—are reduced and distilled into a singular controlling “ideology” through which the insiders interpret their world and organize their purposes in order to act on it.14 In the fields of science and philosophy, heresy occurs when knowledge becomes over-specialized and fractured, leading to various specialties warring with one another about who is really correct. Bemoaning this very fact, the philosopher E. F. Schumacher quotes the renowned psychiatrist Viktor Frankl as saying that:

> The present danger does not really lie in the loss of universality on the
> part of the scientist, but rather in his pretense and claim of totality […]
> What we have to deplore therefore is not so much the fact that scientists
> true nihilism of today is reductionism […] Contemporary nihilism no
> as nothing-but-ness.15
> the monomaniac or fanatic is the result. The fanatic is a person with little
> the exemplary fanatics. Such people are “radicalized” by over-focusing on

They become radical sectarians, losing all meaningful relationship and perspective. And in case we are tempted to assume that ideological fanaticism is limited to those “Muslim crazies,” consider the current state of “uncivil war” in the United States. The “either/or” ideology of the monomaniacal conservative or the arrogance of the elitist liberal becomes prohibitive to even “seeing” the truth in/of the other, let alone finding the ability to engage them as fellow humans. Refining that thinking down further to Christian circles:

> If you consider most conservative evangelicals, they do not believe that
> God is a lively character and a real agent, because they’ve got God all
> packaged up into sustained systematic explanations. And if you consider
> character and a lively agent either, because they really believe that God
> We are so easily imprisoned by our own interpretations and so convinced
> ever-greater God. This was precisely the problem with Israel’s leaders in
> for their own souls and minds as well as for the collective mind of Israel.

In Jesus’ words, they had access to the keys to the kingdom but ignored them, and blocked others from them as well (Matthew 23:13; Luke 11:52).

When this reductionism occurs today, the story we tell manifests itself as propaganda rather than theology.

Please do not misunderstand us here—the fact is, because truth is so big and complex, analytical reductions are necessary if we are going to successfully negotiate the world (or communicate the gospel for that matter). However, because they are only fragments extracted from the whole, they should never be mistaken for the whole picture, in all its unfathomable mystery.17 We ought never to lose sight of the enormity of truth itself—especially when we are talking about God and the mystery of his involvement in our world.

> The Need For A Radical Reframing

So why are we spending so much time on this here? We want to throw a torchlight on the many reductions of how we understand and experience both God and gospel. On the one hand we believe many of our problems in engaging missionally (Camino, Playa, and beyond) are rooted in reduced understandings of God that have severely limited the ways in which we think he is to be encountered and communicated in the world. On the other hand we are equally limited by a severely diminished anthropology (understanding of the human condition) and have therefore failed to fully understand the Moving the Moon 9 complex, existential, religiously-motivated elements common to all human beings—desire, longing, and search. (This diminished anthropology is explored in section two of this book.) As a result, Christians no longer know how to connect the various dimensions of God’s good news to the human search implicit in all culture and evident throughout history. We want to reconnect the dots, reframe the picture, so that God’s people might once again be able to see the marvelous ways in which he is always at work in the putting back together of this broken world.18

## Got Me a Piece of Elephant

We all know the old parable of the blind men and the elephant in which numerous blind men are set on the task of describing an elephant; each grab the piece of the elephant that is at hand and proceed to describe what they think “an elephant really is.” Each of the blind men then assume their interpretation or experience is the only one, but in reality it is a very diminished (reduced) view of an elephant.

Interestingly, this parable is used in numerous religious traditions to address the tendency of religious people everywhere to think they have God under control and all nicely boxed up. As Darrell Guder says: If we accept Karl Barth’s distinction between the Christian faith and “religion,” then the human desire to exercise control would certainly be one of the major characteristics of all [fallen] religious systems. These systems can [appear to] be very pious and impressive. But, in one way or another, they are ultimately expressions of “the hidden desire of the human heart [...] to use God merely to serve [one’s] human purposes.”19

> But God will not, indeed cannot, be put into a box. Guder rightly reminds
> us that God’s unwillingness to be put in a box or be controlled takes us back
> to the very revelation of the divine name given to Moses in Exodus 3:13–15.

Despite Moses’ request to know God’s name, God refused to allow himself to be confined by a human constraint. The meaning of his name (YHWH) is best translated as IWill Be There as IWill Be There. The triune God cannot be conjured up; he will choose to appear when and in whatever manner he so chooses. Nothing about him can be predicted or neatly categorized. In other words, God always retains the element of surprise. YHWH claims an always unlimited and uncontrollable sovereignty. The name of God poses a constant challenge to our human attempts to master God for our own purposes.20 God is always ungraspable in himself; he is always more.

We are not saying all religious claims are the same, or that God is relativized in any way—we really believe that the God revealed in Scripture, and especially through Jesus, is indeed absolute. We are simply highlighting the fact that our grasp on him can never be absolute. Humans are limited and cannot comprehend the Absolute absolutely. Therefore, our historical reductions (the pieces of the elephant we happen to be describing) are really not the whole picture, but only a part. The early church Fathers, who were theological virtuosos when it came to exploring the boundaries of what can and cannot be known about God, were right to remind us that when dealing with the Lord of the universe there is always more. Even in our best attempts, we never arrive at a totally comprehensive understanding of God. If anyone claims to have done so, then it is not God that they have understood.

It is this human tendency to control God that lies at the heart of his condemnation of idolatry. All idolatry and religious image-making are implicit attempts to limit (reduce) and thereby control God. Idolatry is the worship of the parts instead of the whole, one aspect of the universe in place of the Creator of all who transcends all. And the Bible is unrelenting in its attack on the religious roots of reductionism, as Guder highlights: “The Prophets unmasked man’s religiosity as being not just a desire for God, but a desire to have a god, to possess him, to have him for their own, at their disposal.”21 This is as true now as ever.

As beings who are so concerned about control, we find the universal significance and translatability of the gospel offensive, even a shock. Atranslatable gospel is fundamentally not a controllable one—it’s too big; it breaks our boxes. It unsettles us to discover that faithfulness to Christ can vary from culture to culture, and is expressed with different patterns than the ones we have so painstakingly evolved. Western Christianity has assumed it represents the cultural perfection of the gospel. But no particular cultural rendering of the gospel, Western or otherwise, may claim greater validity than any other, and most certainly none have yet perfected it.22 Therefore we must always address our tendencies to suppress, own, and limit God and gospel. The church must come awake to our participation in this heresy of reductionism, especially in our attempts to communicate the story of God. “Our faithful witness can only happen when we learn to see and repent of our conformities. These conformities must be addressed when we examine the issue of gospel reductionism and open ourselves to our own continuing conversion.”23 Moving the Moon 11

Ultimately, the sad (and frankly embarrassing) outcomes of accumulated reductions and codifications of the truth are seen and experienced in our lives and churches as:

- Ossified doctrines; where ideas are believed but not lived, and faith

degenerates into religious ideology

- 

Wooden proclamations; where little resonates with the people beyond (and inside) the church, and theological boredom becomes the order of the day

- Empty doxologies; where ritualized religion replaces true worship,

with no relationship to the eternal and universal perspective

- Legalistic ethics; where discipleship is reduced to religious moralism,

and shame and guilt replace freedom.24 Or perhaps if we were to be more specific, we might simply affirm what our good friend Brad Brisco states when he laments that:

- We have reduced the church to a place and a gathering
- We have reduced mission to evangelism
- We have reduced worship to singing songs
- We have reduced the gospel to bullet points
- We have reduced Christology to the cross
- We have reduced discipleship to the transfer of information
- We have reduced the ministry callings/functions (Ephesians 4) to

shepherd and teacher

- We have reduced Spirituality to withdrawal from the world
- We have reduced church planting to starting worship services.25

## Deadly Religion

We have already observed our all-too-religious penchant for locking God down to selective doctrinal formulas. The result is a safe and controlled zone of believing in belief about God rather than in believing in God himself—God is held as an objective idea rather than a holy relationship. suggests that, rather than identifying ourselves with Stephen the martyr and victim, we should perhaps first read the text through the eyes of the religious leaders in this passage—the ones who stone Stephen. Reading it in this way gives us great insight into the toxic ways of thinking that all religious people are susceptible to. For instance, we can probably assume that those who killed Stephen saw themselves as responsible for protecting the religious tradition, come hell or high water. They couldn’t engage Stephen in authentic conversation about God because of these immovable religious commitments, pre-commitments which they would protect to the hilt before considering other ways of understanding God. So much so that they were even willing to kill people in order to protect them. These commitments implied that they presumed to know exactly how God works, and therefore they refused to make room for anything a professed visionary like Stephen might proclaim. They lashed out in violence because they had fallen victim to the oldest sin in the book, idolatry—in this case an idolatry of the prevailing theology of the religious tradition and of the temple itself.

> Idolatry worships a creation instead of the Creator. Idolatry loves symbols
> more than the thing to which a symbol points. Idolatry satisfies itself
> with knockoffs and shadows. Idolatry imagines God can be contained
> where the treasure resides, they allow no alterations to their maps and

> Stephen’s speech to the high priest warns about idolatry by reasserting

> of heaven and earth and it cannot be limited to a geographically located
> temple is inherently idolatrous; rather, he claims that the members of his
> disproportionate importance to the temple and in doing so were unable to

The idolatry perverting Stephen’s foes hardly afflicts them alone.

It connects to more than a high regard for the Temple and rightly interpreting the Law of Moses. It involves temptations that beset probably all religious people (including Stephen?): to turn a quest for God into an enterprise of self-assured arrogance instead of a search requiring humble reliance on fellow seekers and openness to new and old ways of finding Moving the Moon 13 God. Steven’s story is not about the bad guys. It’s about coming to terms with the reality that all of us are prone to reject God’s messengers and cling ferociously to what we already know, or think we know, very well.26 Skinner suggests the antidote to idolatry is not to avoid being religious, as violence and self-assurance are hardly limited to religious people; nor does it mean we should suppress our passionate convictions about our beliefs; nor are we to distrust all we think we know, or can know, about God.

Rather, the answer involves keeping in view the object and purpose of our convictions, namely the possibility of encountering God, the Maker of the Universe. The Invitation from God is always an Invitation to relationship, not an Invitation to the “right way” of adhering to rules and regulations.

We fall into danger when we slip into idolatry, esteeming religious rules above relating to the Living God. Reductionism happens when we make following God anything less than relationship with him. We need to understand that love (for God as well as for others) and relationships really matter (Mark 12:30–31). When the defending of truth is done in a loveless way, it violates the very purposes of truth—to make us more like Jesus who is “the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). Or, as Skinner puts it, “If our convictions leave broken bodies in the wake, or if our pursuits of our religious values and prerogatives snuff out people’s vitality in other ways, then we are almost certainly doing something wrong.”27 Are we sure we would not have been among the stoners had we been privy to the events surrounding Stephen? Are we too defending reduced truths, a “system” of belief, a god-in-a-box? Have we grasped the leg of an elephant and made a calling out of proclaiming we have procured the entire animal? Have we taken a truth that is this big (hold your hands out as far as possible) and reduced it to something this big (the smallest space between your thumb and forefinger)? Would we have responded, do we respond, in similar ways to the religious leaders in Acts 7 when we are introduced to a God who is “outside of our frame”? C. S. Lewis warns us of this very issue: “My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast.” Lewis goes on to say that this “shattering” is actually one of the sure signs of God’s presence, with the incarnation being the ultimate example, leaving “all previous ideas of the Messiah in ruins.”28 Reductions, restrictions, and limitations are much more easily managed than interpreting a truth and grace that confounds our sense of logic and fairness; a truth that is always bigger, never smaller. Have we placed God in a box and, in doing so, have we created an ossified, wooden, empty, and legalistic religion that has reduced the reality and truth of God?

This holy love will upend a life obsessed with safety and security (Hebrews 12:18, 29). God is not safe, nor containable, and he claims us, body and soul, but this is what we are made for. In acknowledging God as a consuming fire, we recognize he can never fit in any box we try to place him in. He is always the ever-greater God, and the seducer of our hearts.

> MARt INLu THER’SPa NICAt Ta CKS

We suggest that one of the reasons for our current eclipse of God among Protestants is that, by-and-large, we are so keyed into the theologicalanthropological frequencies of a different era that we cannot seem to grasp, let alone name, the existential issues evident in our own time. Strangely enough, this blindness partly came from a reduction arising from Martin Luther’s profound struggle before God—his anfechtungen—in the distinct theological context of the sixteenth century. (Anfechtung is the word Luther used when describing his own personal times of spiritual terror, despair, and religious crisis.)29 Now to be sure, Luther was a very spiritual man living in medieval Europe, part of a culture that was enchanted by its immersion in all things God. Furthermore, the prevailing worldview was shaped by the long tradition of Christendom Europe, meaning the church and its symbols were present everywhere. Aprofessor of the New Testament, Luther ended up experiencing an existential crisis as he grappled with Romans 1:16–17, which references God’s “righteousness” being revealed in the gospel of Jesus. But Luther could not work out how God’s righteousness could possibly be good news to an unrighteous sinner. Surely it meant that we were hopelessly lost because we could never rise to God’s level of righteousness. At the heart of his anfechtung was the terrifying feeling that God was ultimately going to judge and condemn the sinner—of which he felt the foremost.

Luther then (re)discovered that Paul’s revelation in Romans was that righteousness was to be received as a gift of God’s grace, through personal faith—and boom!—the rest is history. It’s not too far-fetched to say that the whole Reformation was born out of the recovery of this single insight.

Everything changed.

Moving the Moon 15 The problem was that this formulation of the gospel was so powerful in the context of the guilt-ridden medieval consciousness of the time, it soon became the only way that “the gospel” was formulated.30 It was as if the question of objective guilt before God was the only issue human beings ever deal with. In other words, “the gospel” was so reduced to only resolving human guilt that it inadvertently left so many other dimensions of the human condition untouched by the good news. And therein lies the problem we attempt to address: the evangelical gospel has become one-dimensional— it has for such a long time been minimized and narrowed to “the Romans Road,” “the Four Spiritual Laws,” “the Two Ways,” and the like.

Again, we don’t want you to hear what we are not saying. We do believe that humans are indeed desperately separated from a holy God and very much in need of God’s forgiveness; we do believe that Jesus died vicariously in order to reconcile and restore his creation before himself.

These are absolutely vital dimensions of the good news of Jesus Christ.

But what we are saying (throughout this entirebook) is that this is not the only dimension of the gospel. As astonishing as forgiveness of personal sins is, God has done even more than that in the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of his Son, Jesus Christ. The good news has relevance to every aspect of humanity’s brokenness, not just personal guilt before God.

The consequence seems obvious: if justification by faith is the only way we are allowed to articulate the good news, then in order to tell the story of Jesus to a group of people who don’t experience themselves as guilty-before-a-holy-God, we feel the obligation to make people feel bad about themselves before they can feel better. And so evangelicals (good news people?) come off as the tongue-clucking, finger-wagging moralizers that everyone seeks to avoid (the antithesis of good news people). Besides, when did we assume the role of the Holy Spirit? Is it not the Spirit’s task to convict people of sin and righteousness (John 16:8–11)? Our job is to announce and demonstrate good news in a bad news world.31 When we play the Pharisee, we become part of the bad news. God wants to forgive people of their sins and has already provided a way for that, but guilt need not always be the singular starting place in an individual’s life.32 Deb Hirsch recounts hearing a speaker once pose the question, “What should be the first thing that can be said about any human being?” The overwhelming majority of the (Christian) audience answered by saying that people are first and foremost fallen sinners, capable of evil, and in need of salvation. The speaker then challenged their response and went on to explain that, while it is true that all have sinned and fallen short, there is still a more fundamental truth: each and every person is “like God”—we are all created in his image. This truth is the primary truth that precedes and qualifies the secondary truth—that we are indeed fallen sinners in need of redemption.33 The story must always start at the beginning.

Christianity too often begins by emphasizing a problem (original sin) instead of beginning with the wonderful unity between creation and Creator (original blessing). We first remind you that you are “intrinsically disordered” or sinful—which then allows us to just happen to have the perfect solution. It is like the vacuum cleaner salesman first pouring dirt on your floor, so he can show you how well his little Hoover works. As if the meaning of the universe or creation could start with a foundational problem!34 So often the evangelical culture falls into the trap of starting its proclamation of the gospel in Genesis 3 (original sin) rather than in Genesis 1 (original blessing). When this happens, the good news simply becomes about how we get rid of all that guilt and all that sin. But if we desire to start at the beginning (a simple proposal that aligns with any storytelling technique … “once upon a time”), then we must begin with Genesis 1. Humanity is created in the image of God and that creation was good and right until separation from God happened in Genesis 3. Then the good news becomes about how God brings his family back together and restores the world, both as they were intended. If we reduce the gospel by beginning with the problem, then the whole search for God becomes a negative problemsolving journey. And to those who are desperately searching for something more, reducing the good news to problem-solving and moralism presents itself as an exercise in futility.

In chapters to come, we will explore how we can broaden the conversation beyond simply talking about guilt and sin. For now, we simply note that human beings have a much larger register of religious and existential need than just guilt before God, as real as that is. Aholistic approach to God’s total and saving response to each and every one of these issues is far more expansive than our limited view has allowed.

## One Size Fits All

Procrustes, whose name means “he who stretches,” is arguably one of the most intriguing characters in Greek mythology. He was a devious villain who kept a house by the side of the road in which he would offer hospitality to passing strangers. The guests were invited in for a pleasant meal and a Moving the Moon 17 night’s rest in his “very special bed,” which Procrustes described as having the enchanting property of matching the exact length of anyone who lay down on it, magically of course. What Procrustes left out of the description was the method by which this one-size-fits-all miracle was achieved: as soon as the guest would fall asleep in the special bed, Procrustes would begin his villainous procedure, stretching the guest on the rack if they were too short for the bed or chopping off their legs if they were too long—a rather unfortunate way of making everyone conform to his one-size-fits-all bed.

Procrustes’ infamous allegory has found its way into our language when we describe something as “a procrustean bed” or “procrustean effort,” or simply call something “procrustean.” It denotes an asserting of a set of assumptions and subsequently forcing everything to fit those assumptions even when they do not fit—like forcing a round peg to fit a square hole.

It should come as no surprise that people guilty of “the procrustean way” also tend to formulate problems in such a way that the solutions to those problems demand precisely the very tools and processes that they (rather providentially) just so happen to have at hand, and which they are already skilled at.35 Social psychologist Abraham Maslow wrote of interpreting the world through a similar single lens when he developed what he later called “the law of the instrument” or “the law of the golden hammer.” This describes the consequence of over-reliance on a particular idea, tool, or interpretation.

In The Psychology of Science in 1966 he suggested that, if the only tool you have is a hammer, then you will treat everything as if it were a nail.36 It is a one-size-fits-all approach to life.

Arelatively harmless example of this is in the 2002 movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, where the patriarch of the family, Gus Portokalos, believed that a squirt of Windex was the solution to all that ails humanity. Any ailment “from psoriasis to poison ivy” could be cured with a quick spray of Windex.37 No matter what the presenting problem was, Gus would point to his bottle of Windex and then spray: a classic force-to-fit strategy of dealing with reality. And we in the church do this very same thing whenever we become enamored with a single defining solution or formula and then reformat all our theology to suit—whole theological systems and denominations are built on precisely this impulse.

Von Balthasar suggests that many theologians throughout history have had a bad habit of isolating some fragment of knowledge upon which they begin imposing their own speculations … procrustean theology is the result.38 We see this throughout the centuries as numerous historical players and agencies have scrambled to make the message of the Scriptures fit their prior experiences, understandings, organizational brands, or preferences, and then demand compliance from their respective adherents. And God help the poor wretches who did not fit. Christendom (the name itself implies an imperial assumption of domination and control) has subsequently forced, often with great violence, much of reality and culture to fit the formulas.

Christendom managed to do even more violence to its dissenters than Procrustes himself—their range of tortures also included the stretching of, or the removal of, limbs, but went way beyond this to include flaying of the skin, emasculations, drownings, and, of course, the ultimate of tortures … burning people alive in the public square in the name of God.39 Or consider some other forms of reductionism … such as reductions in our concept of church. There are now more than 25,000 denominations worldwide—each of these constructed around selective visions drawn out from the grander view of the church in the Scriptures.40 Many of these define and distinguish themselves based on structure, leadership, on baptismal mode, understandings of atonement theory, belief in predestination or freewill, whether adherents speak in tongues or not, whether one uses musical instruments in worship or not, etc. Each of these have their favored Bible verses but therefore they are reductions.

It is surely an act of God’s sheer grace that over its lifetime the church has managed to get a lot of things right, but it must also be acknowledged that we have managed to force fit the greater biblical truths into innumerable reduced doctrinal formulas, which are then in turn used to bolster the reduction of a greater truth. One can say that almost every denomination is in some way a victim of Procrustes.

## A Way Past the Eclipse

In section three of this book, we will propose ways to reverse the effects of the eclipse and to move past our procrustean ways. For now, in these first three chapters, we need to explore and recognize that it is a problem both contemporary believers and unbelievers alike must face—a reduction of truth, a reduction of the story, and the natural result, a reduced way of living. These reductions are at the heart of our own incapacity to see and experience God’s transcendence, as well as his immanence, in all things.

Not only do we struggle to readily discern God at work on the Playa and the Camino, we equally struggle to see God at work beyond the narrow and privatized confines of the domain of church.
