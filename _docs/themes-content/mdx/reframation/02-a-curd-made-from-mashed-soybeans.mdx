## — FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

Telling stories is as basic to human beings as eating. More so, in fact, for while food makes us live, stories are what make our lives worth living.

## — RICHARD KEARNEY

Old Testament scholar Walter Brueggemann writes, “The gospel is … a truth widely held, but a truth greatly reduced. It is a truth that has been flattened, trivialized, and rendered inane.”1 When we reduce God and truth, what naturally follows is a reduction of the story of God that we tell The telling of a reduced story takes the always impressive and authoritative story of Jesus, and siphons it of its transformative power, drains it of its restorative influence, or simply bleeds it dry until it is lifeless.

This happens all the time in Sunday School when Jesus’ stories are used to bolster middle-class morality rather than unleashing the revolutionary call to transformation they’re intended to be; the prevalence of the so-called “Sunday School Jesus!” It is these reductions and the shrouding of truth that have left us completely unprepared for the missional moment and context we find ourselves in. All this makes a meaningful proclamation about God putting the world back together again so very difficult—this is true whether the context is a church gathering, the Camino, the Playa, or simply a conversation with our next-door neighbour.

In contrast Everts asks, “Have you ever had Warheads Sour Candy?

You put a Warhead in your mouth and immediately your body has two reactions, either 1) ‘I feel alive; everything is now in color!’ or 2) You spit it out of your mouth as fast as you can, because you cannot handle the ‘jarring taste.’’’2 We propose that this somewhat ridiculous comparison (tofu v Warheads) illustrates the different ways the story of Jesus is retold.

The Jesus story ought to be experienced like Warhead Sour Candy—it should jolt us. It should startle us. This jarring dimension of theological truth applies to all the manifold revelations of God in Scripture and history, but it is especially applicable to the life and ministry of Jesus. Acursory reading of the Gospels shows that anyone who got a “taste of Jesus” either wanted to spit him out as quickly as possible, or they ended up intrigued saying, “I don’t know where this is going, but I feel strangely alive!” An encounter with the incarnated story of God-in-Christ always changed lives, one way or another.

In the same vein, Tim Keller writes: Jesus’s teaching consistently attracted the irreligious while offending the Bible-believing religious people of His day. However, our churches do not have this same effect, which can only mean one thing. Our preaching and practices are not declaring the same message that Jesus did.3 The temptation when communicating the story of God is to settle for “a curd made from mashed soybeans” because, well, we have come to believe that even a tasteless religiosity is better for us than having no religion at all.

## WIRED FOR STORY

So why is story important? What is passed on in and through telling a better story? And what is lost when our stewardship of God’s story is dissolved into religious formula?

All human beings are formed through narrative. It is what shapes our identities as people—corporately as in tribal history, and personally through events that impact our sense of who we are and what our roles are in the world. We are wired for story.

Human beings live inside stories. Stories are how we communicate with each other; how we connect with each other. They are how we learn, how we think.4 The stories we consume shape so much of who we are, what we do, how we act, and what we believe. Stories are not simply a way to communicate; they live in and around us in a way that allows humans to advance.5 All cultures and societies use story to pass on cultural DNA, to form identity, and give context for meaningful engagement in the world. "Telling stories is as basic to human beings as eating. More so, in fact, for while food makes us live, stories are what make our lives worth living."6 As philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre points out in his classic After Virtue, I can answer the question, "What am I to do?" only if I can answer the prior question, "Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?"7 Story is a vital part of the frame.

We would do well to consider why stories like The Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, or The Chronicles of Narnia have captivated the imagination of millions of people. We would argue that these stories capture our imagination and provide us with new ways of seeing the world—with new possibilities and questions to explore. Their characters are threedimensional and credible. We sympathize with them when they fail or are wounded. We feel joy when they succeed or fall in love. We are drawn into the plot, the bigger story, because the characters and story are plausible, carrying universal significance. They allow us to enter into worlds we couldn’t see on our own, and in a very real sense to inhabit those worlds.

Stories allow us to seriously confront questions, such as: what if I lived in a world where magic was real? What if I encountered a piece of furniture that transported me to a different world? What would I do if the “one ring” came into my possession?

Maybe above all they are tales about transformation in which all creatures are revealed in the end for what they truly are—the ugly duckling becomes a great white swan, the frog is revealed to be a prince, and the beautiful but wicked queen is unmasked at last in all her ugliness. They are tales of transformation where the ones who live happily ever after, as by no means everybody does in fairy tales, are transformed into what they have it in them at their best to be.8 Ultimately, stories like these enable us to ask, if I entered this story, who would I be? In the same way, when we tell the story of Jesus with similarly rich metaphors, it provokes questions and thoughts, such as: How would my life change if I lived in a world where it was truly better to give than receive? What would it be like to live in a world where the first shall be last and the last shall be first? If I really did believe that God had power over death, would that alter the way I lived? What would it be like to live in a world where death didn’t have the final word? 9 Why is it that these questions, central to the Jesus story, are scarcely considered? Is it because, as Christians, we so often present a onedimensional story, with our formulaic points and doctrine inserted in?

God’s revelation is not some storyless event that can be observed and then filed away in neat categories: it is the record of his dramatic rescue of the world, a rescue that is still unfolding in our world every day. We are participants in this story, and whether we like it or not, we are in the drama as it is being performed. “We have no real objective viewpoint from which to merely observe.”10 This is not to say that theological formulas are not important, but on their own, and divorced from the living context of narrative and testimony, they can become stultifying and dangerous ideologies. Story and narrative communicate truth, and form identity in a way that rational code simply cannot.

Our attempts to distill the Bible—which is bursting with life, intrigue, and drama—to a series of principles is equivalent to trying to reduce a living person to a diagram. The exodus from Egypt, or the revelation at Sinai, or Miriam’s slander against Moses, are all events, not an idea; a happening, not a principle. Conversely, attempting to reduce the Bible to a catalog of events, a sacred history and nothing more, will equally fail.11 This is precisely why, in Jewish tradition, halakhah (conceptual ideas and ethical code) is always held in balance with haggadah (story, parable, and history).

Each one interprets and makes sense of the other. And both are needed to make sense of the world. It also accounts for why Jews traditionally have generated some exceptional thinkers as well as some of the world's greatest storytellers.12 This role of story was undoubtedly significant for Israel. The biblical story of faith provided a narrative in which an individual would discover who God was, who they were, why they existed, and where they were going. The covenant was given to a particular people and it is to be passed on in living memory through the telling and retelling of the story. And they are urged again and again to recover and reappropriate the story—Isaiah 40–55 is a case in point. That story is remembered annually in the regular liturgy of Israel and is dramatically reenacted in the reading of the Passover Haggadah.

When the biblical characters forgot their narrative, they lost their way.

They no longer knew who they were, where they came from, or where they were going. According to the prophets, the “losing of their story,” their constant forgetting of the covenant relationship established in the patriarchs and at Sinai, was the root of their rebellion and sin (e. g., Judges 8:34). It might well be the root of ours as well.

## Three Ways to Make Tofu

In further understanding our tendency toward reductionisms, we suggest that specific practices have contributed to this “crisis of interpretation.” In the telling of God’s revelatory story and how that story intersects with all of culture, we have been guilty of:

- demythologizing—through shrinking revelation to reduced-to-fit,

anti-supernatural, atheistic/deistic presuppositions about life

- demystifying—by eliminating mystery, wonder, love, and awe from

the equation of how humans can rightly approach and know God, and

- depoeticizing—through dangerously narrowing our perceptive

range and our linguistic capacity to talk about God, thereby reducing theology to rational code and religious formula.

These are key factors related to what has been called the "disenchantment of Western culture” as it moved from the premodern openness to the divine, to the closed, rationalistic, secularized, technique-based culture we currently inhabit.13 The reduction of each of these three elements has contributed to a crisis of interpretation because each directly impacts our capacities to recognize, understand, and respond to the story of God as it unfolds in Scripture and history.

We don’t need to look into the unfolding of history to find these three reductionistic practices at work; we need look only into our own soul. As you read the following pages, try to discern the impact of these reductions on you and the people around you. We all are infected with the virus. The crisis is universal in scope.

## Demythologized

One of the strongest forces in the overall disenchantment of the world and the reduction of story is what has been called demythologization. In relation to the narrative of God, this has involved a systematic attempt to weed out all elements considered “primitive” and “legendary.” The gospel has instead been articulated purely in terms of the rationalistic or existentialist worldview of the twentieth century. To fully grasp this claim, it is important to understand what we do, and do not, mean by the word myth, and why it is so vital to theology and culture, as well as spirituality in general.14 The popular use of the term myth carries with it a negative connotation, especially when brought into conversation about common religious beliefs and superstitions. This widely held definition of myth relates to outdated convictions held by people regarded as “primitive” and “irrational.” So, when people using this nuance dismiss something as a myth, they are dismissing it as untrue.15 (Obvious examples could be applied to holiday myths, such as the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, and Cupid.) We are certainly not referring to this interpretation; rather we are using the term in the same way C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Campbell (among others) have applied it Understood in this way, myth describes those stories that have a “supermeaning”—stories that contain the roots of defining themes that have cultural, religious, or spiritual significance for those who tell them.16 They are the stories that guide, orientate, and illuminate whole peoples and generations. They are narrative frames through which we understand our roles in the world. Evangelical theologian James Menzies notes that: Throughout human history, myth has served as a source to explain questions of creation and human origins, making sense of tragedy, finding meaning for one’s existence, and to help prepare for life after death. And whether one examines indigenous cultures steeped in religion or highly technological cultures espousing many (or no) religions, there is frequently an evidence of myth handed down through generations resulting in ideas and beliefs that intentionally and unintentionally become part of such cultures and societies.17 To say that a story is mythic (in this sense) therefore is not to say that it is mere fantasy. Quite the opposite. By appealing to the power of myth, we give ordinary, everyday things new life and meaning by which life is reoriented and reframed. This is because myth reaches into the innermost levels of human consciousness, something we are actually wired for—there is a “myth receptor” in each one of us. Myth resonates with us because it contains universal and fundamental truth, but mythic stories also have power because they reach beyond the filters of the rational mind and go right into the human heart, that barely conscious place where all our deepest longings are rooted. That’s why humans can’t get enough stories and drama. It’s what takes you back to the bookstore, Netflix, or to the cinema again and again. And this is why, when we speak with mythic resonance, deep calls unto deep.

Literature that engages and forms our imaginations allows knowledge of the head to become knowledge of the heart; situated not in cold abstraction but in a way that is integrated and organic. This type of knowledge doesn’t just change our minds, it changes our lives. Fictional worlds may consist of things which do not exist materially (e. g., hobbits, trolls, elves, dwarves, fairies, wizards, and talking animals), but are built of real transcendentals like truth, justice, and beauty, and in this way can be truer worlds than our own. When we can see that fiction is sometimes fact, we come to understand our experiences in a new and more meaningful way. Emotions such as courage and desire, awe and enchantment, sorrow and guilt, long since dismissed by materialists as simple biological mechanisms, can be true guideposts for a life of faith.

And if we are willing to enter this newfound story, we see that the author is none other than God himself, and he has written it just for us.18

For instance, Lewis explains that a reader, after entering into an experience with a real myth, may well say, “I shall never escape this. This will never escape me. These images have stuck roots far below the surface of my mind.”21 We feel ourselves somehow eternally impacted by the mythic. It speaks to us and our situation one way or another in a never-ending way.

But Lewis says that the real value of the myth is that it takes all the things we know and restores to them the rich significance that has been hidden by the veil of familiarity.

The child enjoys his cold meats (otherwise dull to him) by pretending it is a buffalo, just killed with his own bow and arrow. And the child is wise.

The real meat comes back to him far tastier for having been dipped in a story: you might say that only then is it the real meat. If you are tired of the old real landscape, look at it in a mirror. By putting bread, gold, horse, apple, or the very roads into a myth we do not retreat from reality, we rediscover it.22 When we lose a sense of the mythic dimensions of story, we end up with a low-resonance proclamation that fails to scratch the itch—the splinter in the mind—that people feel lies at the very core of who they are. We lack a message that reaches into the soul—collectively or individually.

## The Disenchanted Mind

So much for what myth is. But what is demyth-ologization and how did it come about? Simply understood, demythologization removes and/or rationalizes the perceived “mythic” elements of a story, rendering it more consistent with a supposedly scientific understanding of the world. Stories thus become “disenchanted.” This has happened primarily in the last three centuries of Western history as part of the overall disenchantment or desacralization of our understanding of the world.

When demythologization has been applied to the biblical story, it has sought to separate and remove what is considered an obsolete understanding of the origin and development of the universe. This demythologization has deeply impacted the collective Western mindset—including yours, much more than you are aware of. This systematic elimination of myth intended:

- to reinterpret events that are overtly supernatural in terms more

consistent with what is considered natural law and admissible science 23

- to extricate what are considered crude folklore and superstition

from historic records in order to render them as rational accounts of history24

- and to extricate philosophical principles and ethics from outmoded

theological claims in order to provide a religious or moral aspect to life.25 We are sure many readers will quickly recognize these forms of rationalism present in their churches and theology. Whether we like it or not, the vast majority of people reading this book will have been taught to think of faith largely in rationalistic terms and, in many ways, to practice faith devoid of a radical openness to the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit. Both mainline Protestant and conservative evangelical cultures are dominated by the language of the scientific and the rational, and because of this there has been a loss of this deeper mythic dimension. The story of God creating the world, ultimately restoring the world and everything in between has been disenchanted … the “magic” has been siphoned out.

Scripture is reduced to a dusty book containing dry history, doctrine, and ethics. The Story of God contained in the Bible no longer inspires and resonates; we no longer engage with it as a call to a wide-eyed adventure of which we are a part. Our theology is no longer performed on its knees, but rather at the desk and in the academy—seldom at church or on the streets.

The academic approach allows us to think that we can pick God apart like we would a frog specimen in science class. This kind of scientific theology does not often require much of us. It allows us to think about God without having to become like Jesus. We can read our books and prepare our sermons without much changing within us.26 Thus, divorced from prayer, worship, and the passionate pursuit of God, theology quickly degenerates into scholasticism. Our theology manuals run dry, our commentaries become fussy and artless, and our proclamation no longer resonates with its intended audience. Our communication lacks any appeal to the real issues of the human longing for salvation and fullness. And if this is not bad enough, the removal of the narrative strength and mythic resonance impairs the disciple’s ability to see, hear, and respond to God with body, heart, and soul. Aflattened story results in a flattened response. Yet the narrative of God in Scripture is an evolving drama in which all are called to actively participate.27 Joseph Campbell, the American author renowned for his work in mythology, warned us that wherever myth is interpreted as mere biography, history, or science, its impact is annulled. The living metaphors and images it contains turn into remote facts. He maintained that when a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the historical and the mythical becomes dissolved. When this deeper dimension is lost in the telling of the gospel, a story that is “too good to be true” is exchanged for a one-dimensional, rational, and believable narrative rather than one that is multi-dimensional and mind-blowing.

The result of this systematic demythologization is that the myths that help us make sense in a senseless world, and give significance to our existence, are consistently drained of their potency and simply absorb the flavors of the foods that surround them. We end up with that darn tofu again. As a result, people turn away from the story of God to just about any other source, in an attempt to find a meaningful alternative. Hollywood and the video gaming and advertising industries have understood all too well the identity-shaping power of myth—and profitably exploit it to great effect. They are on to something the church has forgotten. There is something significant about the way culture tells stories—more than the mere entertainment they provide.

This search for an abiding myth to live by, for mythic living itself, is precisely what is going on in the innumerable new religious movements in our day—the Playa and the Camino are just two cases in point. It also accounts for the popularity and influence of Joseph Campbell and others like him. People will get their defining stories somewhere. The church’s demythologized, rationalistic message, void of story, just does not fill the soul, inspire the heart, or call us to adventure and journey. Our unwillingness to even consider the place of myth in the story of the gospel contributes to a great vacuum in evangelical culture.

## Demystified

All great stories have a sense of mystery, of unresolvable “magic,” an enchantment that draws us in. Astory that transforms us carries with it a mystery that expands the possibilities of what we know, but does not defy reason.

Once again, the problems of perception and interpretation of the divine can be best understood in light of the greater practice of demystification that has been at work in our culture over the last two centuries or so. Modern technological society, in an effort to name, classify, control, and exploit, has effectively demystified the world. The premodern world was a thoroughly enchanted place where people confronted mystery throughout. Despite all the terrible conundrums of suffering and death faced throughout history, when premodern people looked out into the world they were aware of an unfathomable mystery that pervaded every aspect of life. They experienced this world as immediate, personal, and often very threatening. The sense of the divine blazed throughout. But they also intensely experienced the beauty and harmony of the universe.28 Their myths projected all kinds of mysterious meanings to the planets and stars. In terms of religious experience, they were much more open to the divine and to the possibility of theophany (the visible manifestation of God to humanity). They were also open to experiential encounters that led to asking and engaging in spiritual questions. Their “enchanted” world was thus responsive, full of a spiritual radiance, for which we moderns have neither name nor concept.

To a great extent we now live in a largely desacralized (or sacred-free) world.29 While rejecting outright animism (the practice of assigning a soul to inanimate objects) and polytheism (the worship of multiple gods) as ways of understanding and encountering God, the Scriptures affirm the fact that all of reality is, or can become, a theatre for the holy. Theophanies are littered throughout Scripture, from the burning bush in Exodus 3 to the powerful demonstration in the Incarnation of the Word. The Bible is written from within what is called the premodern worldview. Nature is not to be identified with God. But neither is nature neutral; rather, it is “charged with the grandeur of God” (Hopkins).30 God is both transcendent and immanent and therefore permeates absolutely everything, as J. V. Taylor, in his remarkablebook The Christlike God, points out: Wherever God exists he exists wholly. In his infinitude he cradles the universe, yet he knows every atom of its structure from within. The truth of God transcendent and of God immanent, his mystery and his availability, must be held together as a single reality, dialectical to human thought but indivisible in itself. The God who is within things is not secondary or less than the God who is beyond. His unfathomable otherness addresses each of us with an intimacy surpassing all other relationships.31 “Woe is Me! for I am Undone” Any genuine encounter with God—what Rudolf Otto calls “the Numinous”—brings about a sense of utter holiness, awe, and wonder, different from anything we experience in ordinary life.32 According to Otto, an encounter with “the Numinous” is comprised of the three components contained in the Latin phrase: mysterium tremendum et fascinans—the encounter with a holy mystery that is both awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Let us define what we imply: Mysterium involves a sense of the wholly Other, of unadulterated holiness, of limitless incomprehensibility, and is responded to with blank wonder, stupor even.

Tremendum comprises a sense of holy dread, reverential awe, of unapproachability because of the sheer majesty, might, and vitality that is encountered in the Numinous.

Fascinans is made up of a sense of potent charm, attractiveness. In spite of the fear and terror, we are held in awe.

You can see all these dimensions in every theophany and encounter that humans have with God. For example, “‘Woe to me!’ I cried. ‘I am ruined!

For I am a man of unclean lips'" (Isaiah 6:5); “When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, ‘Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!’” (Luke 5:8); and upon seeing his vision of Jesus in the figure of a Warrior-Judge, John falls on the ground as though dead (Revelation 1:9– 18). This is the pattern of all theophany in Scripture.

The three elements of holiness/otherness, awe/dread, and fascination/ attraction are so intimately related that they form an irreducible, synthetic whole. These aspects of the Numinous and the otherworldly are so often conspicuously absent in the demystified story of God, or the reduced version of Jesus, that we so often communicate.33 When someone has an authentic experience of the Holy, they find themselves caught up in two opposite movements at the same time. They are both daunted by, and yet irresistibly drawn into, the mystery they have encountered. We both draw back from and are pulled forward into a kind of liminal space where we are not at home at all and yet totally at home for perhaps the first time.34

> The paradoxical tension between the fear inspired by the otherworldly

Sacred and the irresistible attraction it exerts at the same time on the believer was the very essence of religious consciousness. Since human reason is unable to break its code, the numinous also always appears as the mystery.35

The profound mystery of God’s inescapable presence ought to evoke wonder and should be a part of the story we tell. Abraham Heschel calls this a “sense of the ineffable” and without it, we will never be able to comprehend God or the things of God.36 The Bible consistently teaches that the fear, or awe, of God is the gateway to the love and knowledge of God (e. g., Proverbs 9:10). And it is this aspect of mystery, respect, and awe that is missing from our modern sense of interpretation.

## Depoeticized

This attempt to gain a rational grasp of God, and to manage and systemize the story of this God’s incarnation, has left our experience and proclamation of the divine with little originality, creativity, and artistry. Such a tragic but very true reduction has not only demythologized and demystified the Story, it has “depoeticized” it as well.

In what should be a powerful and beautiful story of creation, separation, rescue, and restoration, we have reduced the magnificence and grandeur; instead of being spiked with a dash of Warhead, it’s been laced with tofu. David Lipscomb, an important religious leader and educator in the second half of the nineteenth century, warned his hearers that they were to read the Bible narrowly, always taking it in its most literal sense. Such an approach he claimed, “keeps man on safe ground […] and clips the wings of imagination and speculation and makes the Bible the only and safest teacher of duty to man” (italics ours).37 Lipscomb’s mentor was an influential man named Tolbert Fanning, and it appears it was from him that Lipscomb inherited his negative assessment of imagination. In his eulogy to Fanning, H. R. Moore said, “He waved no plumes, wreathed no garlands, but struck from the shoulder and at the vitals. He was destitute of poetry and barren of imagination.”38 Now, just to be clear, eulogies are intended to represent the highest of praise for someone; a summary of their life. What boggles the mind then is trying to comprehend what kind of reasoning and logic considers the words “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” as high praise and worthy of a eulogy.

Read that tragic line one more time: He was destitute of poetry and barren of imagination. Such a sorrowful lament.

The question for us then becomes, is this poverty of imagination and poetry still prevalent in our circles? We think it is. From our experience it seems that most classic evangelical education fails to pass on any appreciation of poetry or a hermeneutic that understands how it is that revelation impacts the godly imagination. Students are often told what to believe and are schooled in analytical/rationalistic approaches to theology and exegesis. This is a huge deficiency in our capacity to enter into a relationship both with God and his story. As Robert Frost reportedly noted, “Poetry is what gets lost in translation.”39 But what a loss!

Consider this: much of the Bible is written in poetic form—prophecy with its fertile symbolism and rhetorical rhythm; the apocalyptic with its multitude of images and metaphor; the Psalms with their lyrical cadence of joy and lament. Symbols, metaphors, and other verbal tangents are the very stuff of poetry, and these are loaded throughout Scripture. We cannot expect to grasp what is being communicated if we fail to interpret these in the way they are intended to be read. Poetry cannot, and must not, be read in the same way one reads rational and systematic code.

“The imagination,” John Piper writes, “calls up new words, new images, new analogies, new metaphors, new illustrations, new connections to say old, glorious truth—whether from the world or from the word of God.

Imagination is the faculty of the mind that God has given us to make the communication of his beauty beautiful.” To communicate breathtaking truth in a boring way is “probably a sin,” he says, for God is “infinitely worthy of ever-new verbal, musical, and visual expressions.”40 Because its appeal is precisely to the imagination, the story of Jesus is obviously not meant to be read without an understanding of metaphor and other language forms. Furthermore, all the prophets were poets. If you doubt that, just try reading them in a purely literal manner and see where it gets you. They pile metaphor upon metaphor. Metaphor really is a remarkable tool because it means what it says but also what it doesn’t say.

You don’t try to figure a metaphor out; rather you try entering into what’s there.41 For instance, when Jesus is called “the Lamb of God” in John’s writings, he is not saying Jesus is a literal lamb, a baby sheep. Or when Peter calls Jesus a “living Stone,” it does not mean Jesus’ chemical makeup had changed into a new form of rock. Rather these are types of creative speech designed to communicate something much more meaningful regarding Jesus’ person and work, and to encourage us to respond. All forms of language, (narrative, poetry, prose, etc.) are found to be destitute and barren when read one-dimensionally—in fact it can be outright dangerous to do so. How can we ever come to grips with either the content or the purpose of God in his story if we don’t understand how to engage poetry and prose?

Consider the effects of siphoning and draining the power of story in the Gospels. Whether it is misinterpreting Jesus when he uses the metaphor of the yeast of the Pharisees (Matthew 16), or Jesus returning to a place where they could not go (John 14), or the eating of the body and drinking of the blood of Christ (John 6), or the meaning of being born again (John 3) and a host of others, people “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” can never seem to grasp what Jesus was really saying. People mishear what Jesus said precisely because of their inability to think poetically and metaphorically. They are trying to make sense of Jesus’ use of parabolic logic within the concrete logic that has no means to interpret the Big Story or access the content of what is being revealed. Too often people cannot grasp Jesus because he speaks poetically (evoking imagination), and by interpreting him literally they are bound to doctrinally predetermined templates devoid of imagination.42 Afailure to engage God and the Bible poetically and imaginatively means we will likely misread both because we are forcing our experiences of the sacred to speak in linear, informational categories as opposed to entering into a world of metaphors, parables, word-play, and evocative language. It’s like trying to interpret multi-dimensional reality with a onedimensional method. It flattens the revelation.

How many times do we make the same mistake and force a univocal literalism (only having one meaning) on a multivocal text? When we do so, the Bible becomes an echo of our own voice and mentality. It is all cut and dried. Predictable as opposed to surprising. Religious as opposed to spiritual. Benign as opposed to liminal. The Word is entrapped in the hermeneutics of literalism—the resonance and the sheer voluptuousness of Truth is gone.

It is this depoeticized (“destitute and barren”) perspective of theology, God, and the story of Jesus that contributes greatly to a story that has been reduced to “a curd made from mashed soybeans.” Unfortunately, we have all been effectively blinded to this great reduction.

## The Red Terror

We cannot allow the story to be reduced. We cannot allow it to be demythologized, demystified, or depoeticized. We must resist the reductionist tendencies and instead recognize the power of story in our lives and especially in the proclamation of the gospel.

The October Revolution is one of the labels given to a socialist revolt in Russia in the year 1917. Led by Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik Party overthrew the existing autocratic government in a seizure of state power that contributed to the eventual rise of the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks took control over multiple government agencies and seized control of rural areas. In order to suppress any dissension to the revolution, the security organization “Cheka” was created. This Bolshevik secret police, Cheka, was given the task of ensuring the revolution continued accordingly by quashing anything resembling a rebellion by workers or peasants throughout the countryside. Many thousands of Russian people (some estimates reach 500,000) were arrested, detained, tortured, or executed by the Cheka over a three to four-year period in what has been labeled “The Red Terror.” This is one of the stories passed down throughout the years of this horrific time of unspeakable violence:

> One day into a small rural village in the shadows of the Ural Mountains
> rode a lone horseman who asked to meet with some of the leaders of the

The day eventually arrived for the festival, and the town was decorated beautifully, and into the town flooded the best of the storytellers for miles and miles. They gathered in the town hall in the center of town at the appointed time and waited for the party to begin. Finally, the man who initiated this whole event arrived at the town hall, along with a few associates who remained near the rear of the hall.

Stepping to the front of the crowd the man proclaimed, “Welcome, I am thrilled that all of you were able to make it to this celebration today. For today we want to pay special attention to all the storytellers throughout this land. We ask simply that you wait just a few more moments for the festivities to begin.” At that moment, the man stepped out of a door near the front of the hall. And his associates did the same in the back of the building.

There was a quiet buzz in the room, an anticipation of what might happen next. After a few moments, the room became eerily quiet. Then suddenly, the sound of horses entering the courtyard surrounding the building could be heard.

When the people looked out of the windows they saw torches being used to set the town hall on fire. Smoke began to seep into the room. As they tried to escape they realized the doors had been sealed from the outside, evidently by their “hosts.” The building burned to the ground. And every storyteller for miles was mercilessly killed.43 Unbelievably, events similar to this happened in village after village across the countryside of Russia during this time of Red Terror. It seemed as though the Bolsheviks understood a real truth: If you take away a people’s story, they no longer know who they are.

> They lose any sense of values, or where they come from or where they are going.

Remove a people’s story and you can put anything in its place.
