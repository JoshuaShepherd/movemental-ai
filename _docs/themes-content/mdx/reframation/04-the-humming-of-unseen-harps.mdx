## (THE SPIRITUAL ANATOMY OF DESIRE)

## — ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING

I (Mark) met Alex almost three weeks into our pilgrimage at the end of one of our longest days of walking on the Camino de Santiago. Alex was from London where she worked for London Underground in some type of upper management position.1 She was thirty-ish with a lively personality, great wit, and was generally enjoyable to walk alongside on the trail. But she did walk very slowly … extremely slowly. Yet somehow she always found a way to get to each day’s final destination. I am willing to wager that on one or two occasions a taxi gave her pace a boost.

After a long day of walking on the Camino, most evenings were generally spent sharing an informal meal with five to ten people we had journeyed with that day, or perhaps a few days earlier. The food was never the finest of cuisine, but the dinner conversations were almost always interesting (if you spoke the same language, and sometimes even if you didn’t).

Alex had the person to her left answer first and then proceeded around the table, which left her to go last. Everyone gave thoughtful answers to the questions, nothing really unexpected. When it got to Alex, she was prepared. She had evidently been thinking about these questions all day. This long and arduous pilgrimage was affecting her worldview in a multitude of ways. She began by saying, “Well, first of all, just so you know, I don’t believe in God.” This was an odd opening statement, but it didn’t necessarily disturb or unsettle anyone; it was on a par with almost every outlook we had encountered on the Camino so far.

Alex then proceeded to describe all she had seen and experienced that day in words and phrases bursting with poetic enthusiasm, detailing the amazing beauty of creation and how she was in awe of the grand display of splendor. She described a personal transformation occurring within her, one that would probably change most things about her life, particularly her career. She was tired of living for nothing and wanted to make a difference in the world but wasn’t exactly sure how she might go about implementing this. That night around the table, in an answer exceedingly longer than anyone else’s, Alex was describing something in her that was restless, some kind of a deep longing that she did not know how to fulfill. There was a stirring in her soul, a soul that apparently “didn’t believe in God.” Three days later, about fifteen more towns and villages down the trail, I ran into Alex again. I was sitting on a corner resting my weary body, waiting for the Advil to take effect, when Alex walked by. After briefly catching up on each other’s previous couple of days (she never once mentioned a taxi), I told Alex what I had been thinking since that night she had shared her thoughts at dinner.

“Alex, there’s something you said the other night at dinner that I find problematic, to the point that I think I vehemently disagree with you.” It was a surprisingly strong statement for such a casual conversation. I had her attention though.

“You said the other night that you didn’t believe in God?” “That’s right,” she responded, probably a little alarmed as to where I was going with this.

“Well, I hope you hear this right, Alex, but I don’t believe you. I think you actually do believe in God. I think you know there’s Something out there bigger than you, Something that created what you are seeing every day on the trail, and Something that is calling you to a different life than the one you’re living, a life that might actually play a part in putting the world back together.” And then I pulled out a phrase I’ve heard dozens of times: “Look, Alex, I have a pretty strong feeling that this god you don’t believe in is a god I don’t believe in either.” I think I made my point, but I wished I could have been as articulate as David Brooks when he wrote in The New York Times: [Faith] begins, for many people, with an elusive experience of wonder and mystery. These moments provide an intimation of ethical perfection and merciful love. They arouse a longing within many people to integrate that glimpsed eternal goodness into their practical lives. This longing is faith. It’s not one emotion because it encompasses so many emotions.

It’s not one idea because it contains contradictory ideas. It’s a state of motivation, a desire to reunite with that glimpsed moral beauty and incorporate it into everyday living.2 That’s what I should have said.

## The Question And The Quest

Albert Einstein is reputed to have once said that if he had only one hour to solve a problem in which his life actually depended on the solution, he would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining the proper question to ask. He claimed that if he knew the right question to ask, he could solve the problem in less than five minutes.3 Einstein’s somewhat counter-intuitive approach might well be worth considering as we seek to reframe our current ways of seeing God and people. The prevailing logic tends toward giving answers rather than asking questions, and in our experience, evangelicals are generally extremely uncomfortable with quest/ions. But if we want to understand the Alexs of our world, we must have a holy curiosity about each and every person we encounter, being more than willing to spend the first fifty-five minutes asking the right questions.

This inability for curiosity has not only led to a diminished understanding of God but is also highly problematic for an informed missional understanding. Many of us cannot comprehend what is going on in broader culture, nor do we seem interested in doing so. All this eclipse and reduction has not only led to a reduced theology (understanding of God) but also to a reduced anthropology (understanding of people). How can we begin to understand the longings and desires of the Alexs in our world if we are unwilling to engage in the hard work of exploring culture?

Hence we need a reframation. We need to “look again” at what has become all too familiar. We cannot recognize what we are seeing because we lack the perceptual capacities to make sense of it. We need a wi-l]der and deeper framing of human existence that goes beyond simply highlighting our separation from God. We need an understanding that includes a sense of the tragedy and struggle that is part of making sense of everyday life, as well as an empathetic understanding of the existential restlessness that lies at the root of each one of us. In other words, we need a renewed Index of the human soul. Without this we will simply not be able to missionally exegete the culture, and our proclamation will fail to resonate in any meaningful way—once again, tofu.

## A Missional Anthropology

In his book The Culture Code, Clotaire Rapaille gives a contemporary example of the importance of properly exegeting a culture. He describes how marketers—people who make it their business to know trends, conduct market research, organize focus groups, and ask hundreds of questions—can fail so miserably in their high-paid tasks. He suggests that so many “experts” fail, not because they do not ask questions, but because they simply do not ask the right questions. In so doing, they fail to understand “the culture code”—what is really going on behind people’s choices and behavior.4 Similar to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of habitus, Rapaille builds his model on the assumption that, during childhood, all human beings learn given words (and the ideas connected with them) and naturally associate these various words/concepts with certain emotions.5 He called these primal associations imprints, and it is these that resolutely determine a person’s attitude towards a particular thing. But the imprints do not just affect individual behaviors; pooled imprints make up a collective cultural unconscious, which in turn predetermines and influences the behavior of entire cultures. These provide “the unconscious meaning we apply to any given thing—a car, a type of food, a relationship, even a country—via the culture in which we are raised.”6 The culture code therefore contains and forms the reservoir of unconscious human emotions, habits, and dispositions from which people make the various choices in life. Therefore, Rapaille says, understanding and deciphering the culture code is the key to motivating, designing, and maintaining healthy organizations and enterprises.7 This method of cultural exegesis is not at all dissimilar to Paul’s missionary strategy, as we will see in chapters nine and ten. When seeking to develop a missional anthropology, we need to pay attention to what is not necessarily obvious, but implicit in the culture.

Rapaille describes an experience of being hired to work by Chrysler in the 1990s. His role was focused on reversing the surprising decline in sales of the Jeep Wrangler, a previously successful range of cars. Rapaille sought to understand the cultural code in the market of potential consumers. “When I put groups of consumers together, I asked them different questions. I didn’t ask them what they wanted in a Jeep; I asked them to tell me about their earliest memories of Jeeps.” What he heard was story after story with a strong recurring image—“of being out on the open land, of going where no ordinary car could go, of riding free of the restraint of the road.” He had identified the cultural code.

> I returned to those wary Chrysler executives and told them that the code

> The switch in marketing strategy based upon Rapaille’s research proved to

The people we met on the Camino and at Burning Man had each given an “unconscious meaning” to their faith in God, or lack thereof, based upon the story with which they had grown up and the emotional responses they had to it. If we had asked them, “Tell us your earliest memories of God,” we would most likely have heard some strong recurring imprints— “Growing up wearing Sunday best, but never being quite good enough to be in ‘the club’”; or perhaps something more damaging, such as, “Hearing the repeated message that ‘the world is going to hell,’ capped with a large dose of fear-producing fire and brimstone”; for others their imprint might have been an experience of Christians who said one thing on Sunday and lived an entirely different life throughout the week; or simply an impression of a distant and cold God of whom they lived in fear.

Some may have had no experience of God or church; others may have had a horrific or tragic encounter with the church or with individual Christians; for some it may be an experience somewhere between the two.

But we all have an emotional and intellectual attachment, “baggage,” when it comes to faith. It is these experiences, and the combination of emotion and meaning attached to them, that create in people an “imprint.” And it is the blend of these imprints that defines us. We so desperately need to understand this if we are to reframe and enlarge our understanding of the people we encounter every single day.

So our question is... can we exegete our culture’s database of myths and stories, and, in doing so, unravel one of the most fundamental human drivers: desire and longing?

## A Dialectic Of Desire

Perhaps the first step in developing a missional anthropology is to wrestle with the questions: what do we really desire?; what are our deepest longings?; what is it we are all searching for?

Philosopher and theologian James K. A. Smith says culture is not primarily an intellectual, heady phenomenon because we are not those kind of creatures—we are not primarily thinking beings. Smith also suggests we need a new anthropology: We need a retooled, more holistic approach of human persons not necessarily as thinkers, not primarily as knowers, nor primarily as believers. Human persons are fundamentally lovers and if you start here and understand this, that will generate a very different account of what culture is.9 Smith says if we really want to know who someone is, what really defines a person, we need to know the answer to the questions, “What do you want?

What do you love? Because if I know this, I know who you are.”10 This implies we are defined by our desires.

And Smith is not by any means new in claiming this. In Western theology, it was, above all, St. Augustine who taught us that the human being is essentially motivated by desire (eros). Augustine said it is what one loves— what one desires—that determines to what city one belongs, the earthly or the heavenly.11 Passion in the negative sense (lust and covetousness) is nothing else but disordered desire, a longing that fails to acknowledge God as the subject of our heart’s yearnings.

Augustine begins his autobiography Confessions with these timeless words: “For Thou has made us for Thyself and our hearts are restless until they rest in thee.”12 Confessions is the story of his own restless heart in search of fulfillment. He chronicles his first forty years, including his conversion, writing very little of what and how he believed but, instead, of his longings, his desires, and his passions.13 His confessions are those of a life of seeking satisfaction in the wrong places, and of finding no rest until his story intersected with God’s.

Augustine’s argument goes something like this: human desire differs from animal desire in that it is, at root, insatiable. Humans are characterized by a hunger for the infinite, for an eternity of life, love, and joy which, whether they recognize it or not, can be nothing other than God. Assuming that God exists, it will follow that God is indeed humanity’s true end, for the appetite of any living organism shows its function.

The stomach hungers for food because its function is to digest food. As physical taste and hunger may often be mistaken as to their true object, desiring nothing but caviar instead of a balanced diet, man is often mistaken as to the goal of his life, desiring wealth, power or physical pleasure instead of God.14 As we discussed in chapter three, we all worship something, and when what we worship is anything less than God (i. e. an idol), it only leads to dissatisfaction and discontentment; our real appetites continue to be for God, for which these lesser goals are always unsatisfactory analogues and substitutes. “Those who set their hearts on finite goals are always discontented; they must always have more and more and more of what they desire, and failing this are frustrated and miserable.”15 As Smith suggests, it is precisely humanity’s unhappiness, our restlessness in the conditions of tedium and boredom, that affirms: “There seems to be something here that we just can’t shake—that no amount of ‘rational’ atheism seems to be able to excise. Might its persistence be reason to think that there’s something to this?”16 Can we move closer to realizing it is this restless condition of the heart, religious or secular in approach, that leads us all in an ongoing and universal search for truth? It is difficult to deny that there is some degree of insatiable desire, longing, and restlessness present in each and every human being. We can safely say that all humans are familiar with the experience of intensely desiring some thing that will make life more complete, even though they may not be able to name it as such.

It would also be fair to say that most evangelicals don’t have a spiritual vocabulary that incorporates insatiable longing, in the Augustinian understanding of the term. In fact, most would be deeply suspicious and judgmental of people pursuing their desires and longings. And yet it is precisely this dialectic of desire we need to come to grips with if we are to be faithful witnesses to God and unlock human hearts, opening them to the wonders of God and gospel. Without this understanding, we cannot correctly interpret much of what is occurring on the Playa and the Camino and around every workplace and neighborhood.

## Sehnsucht (ˈZEːNˌZƱχ T)

Alistair E. Mc Grath, a theologian deeply influenced by C. S. Lewis, tells us that, “Like Augustine, C. S. Lewis was aware of deep human drives that point to a dimension of our existence beyond time and space, a deep and intense feeling of longing that no earthly object or experience can satisfy.”17 In his book Surprised by Joy, Lewis calls this experience “joy.” Joy is “an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction [...] anyone who has experienced it will want it again.”18 This common human experience is broadly known as sehnsucht. In the most basic and literal sense, sehnsucht means “longing” or “yearning”— the unexpressed sense that something is not right, so much is broken and left unfinished, and this is not the way life was intended to be. It expresses a relentless urge, a deeply emotional state of missing something, an indefinite longing that we may or may not recognize.19 In social sciences, the idea of sehnsucht has been defined as that which “captures thoughts and feelings about past, present, and future aspects of life that are incomplete or imperfect, coupled with a desire for ideal, alternative states and experiences of life. Such thoughts and feelings are typically intense, recurring, and accompanied by a mixture of positive and negative feelings, producing an ambivalent emotional experience.”20 Lewis describes his experiences of this in his autobiography. He relays how, as a young child, he was standing by a magnificent flowering bush, when, for some unexplained reason, a memory was triggered:

> There suddenly rose in me without warning, as if from a depth not of
> years but of centuries, the memory of that earlier morning at the Old
> House when my brother had brought his toy garden into the nursery. It
> me; Milton’s “enormous bliss” of Eden [...] comes somewhere near it. It
> for a biscuit tin filled with moss, nor even (though that came into it)
> was gone, the whole glimpse withdrawn, the world turned commonplace
> had only taken a moment of time; and in a certain sense everything else
> Lewis here describes a brief moment of insight, an overwhelming instance
> reality. We have all experienced this, even though we can’t quite pin it down.

Perhaps it can best be described as a soul-wound, a longing, a desire, or an absence of something that was once present; the feeling of love for something that is lost, like the feeling of love for one who has passed away. This longing is an experience of transcendence. For example, we long for peace, justice, love, beauty, goodness—for God. Yet these things so readily slip our grasp, leaving us with a desire for that which is no longer and not yet.

> There have been times when I think we do not desire heaven; but more
> often I find myself wondering whether in our heart of hearts we ever have
> desires for anything else. [...] It is the secret signature of each soul, the

> longing for something that lasts beyond our life here on earth. The very
> not made to be finite, and we are wounded when we’re faced with this
> God himself: our longings and desires reveal this to be true.

All poets understand sehnsucht and write of it in universal terms. For instance, D. H. Lawrence in his poem “Terra I ncognita” writes: There are vast realms of consciousness still undreamed of vast ranges of experience, like the humming of unseen harps, we know nothing of, within us.

Sehnsucht, this universal longing, this never-ending searching that is instinctive in every single person, is “like the humming of unseen harps within us.” This humming can be disregarded, neglected or suppressed, but it can never be eliminated. And so we conclude that “Alex from London,” as she journeyed on her pilgrimage, is “every person”—especially those who profess no belief in a divine being. Alex’s searching and longing, expressed in her awe of creation and her desire for purpose, is not unique to her. Our Creator has set eternity in each and every one of our hearts.

As we have already seen, all human beings are culturally imprinted and we act in ways we are not consciously aware of. It is these “imprints” that really determine a person’s attitude towards a particular thing. The unbelief of many is based largely upon these latent cultural imprints—the truth is that most of what these unbelievers do not believe, Christians do not believe either. And so our professed unbelief can never turn off the humming. Whether acknowledged or not, the whole of Alex’s being is a search for God, and no amount of baggage and hurt from past experiences can wash away the restlessness of the heart.

## Echoes Of A Voice

It is this divinely placed humming that is an intrinsic part of the human soul, which in turn generates so much of the culture code. If we are to develop a missional proclamation that opens the door of human hearts in our time, one that will truly resonate, then we need to follow C. S. Lewis’ advice in developing a dialectic of desire—one that recovers Augustine’s theme of a restless heart. We will look into how we can practically tap into and access the power of directing desires in chapters nine and ten. For now, we simply have to acknowledge that we have much to learn if we are to develop a missional anthropology (and proclamation) that resonates with the real experiences of all human beings.

In his brilliant book Simply Christian, N. T. Wright explores four areas of desire that apply directly to sehnsucht. Wright says today’s world can be interpreted by understanding there are four “echoes of a voice,” each of which call us to a place beyond ourselves, that lead us toward something we may not be able to understand or articulate, but that we all desire.

When we consider the communities and individuals with whom we are engaged, these four echoes are impossible to ignore:

- Alonging for justice. Everyone recognizes the world is full of

brokenness, and the universal desire is to see it repaired. It is the longing for the world to be set right.

- Athirst for spirituality. The awareness all humans have (whether

acknowledged or not) that they are made for communion with someone or something much bigger, much greater, than anything we can know on our own.

- Ahunger for relationship. The easiest of the echoes to hear—we

all have a need for belonging, the desire to know and be known. We were made to be in relationship.

- Adelight in beauty. All humans experience, and yearn for this,

during their lives. “Beauty is to the spirit what food is to the flesh.

Aglimpse of it in a young face, say, or an echo of it in a song fills an emptiness in you that nothing else under the sun can. Unlike food, however, it is something you never get your fill of. It leaves you always aching with longing not so much for more of the same as for whatever it is that makes it beautiful.”28 We would add one more universal echo to Wright’s four echoes; that of the human need for significance, meaning, and purpose. Humans are meaninghungry creatures who will shrivel and die for want of hope and direction.

These echoes are not exhaustive to all issues of life, and N. T. Wright is clear that they do not provide proof that compels belief, nor do they definitively point to the Christian God. However, they may yet open the minds of the honest to look for something more than the flat, scientific materialism and drab consumerism of modern Western culture. Not all truth is revealed through observation and experiment, Wright notes. We see the moral chaos around us, but we somehow know the world was made for justice—our thirst for spirituality, relationships, authenticity, beauty, and significance are real. Such knowledge requires resources beyond those available to the scientist and engineer. Whatever or whoever is ultimately responsible for these echoes is not simply another element or part of this universe. These are echoes of the voice of God.

When we take the time to deeply study human desires and longings, we easily conclude that the search is on; a quest for an experience that climbs beyond ordinary limitations and exceeds our explanation; a journey to a belief that goes beyond mere physical needs and realities. It is a universal search for transcendence in a time when “transcendence has been reduced to a rumour.”29 Alex was seeking the transcendent on the Camino. Something beyond or above the range of normal; something that was more than just about a physical experience. Her questions that night around the dinner table were caused by an otherworldly experience. Whether she was cognizant or not, the deep desire was ever growing within her. It was as if a door had been opened that she did not know existed, and she was in the middle of something that pushed her to a new realm of possibility, beyond any previous experience; a place she longed to enter and possess. Encountering transcendence throws open the windows of the known world to a wholly different world.

Acorrect understanding of the human soul zeroes in on the reflexive desire toward a transcendent experience. To be fully human is to seek answers to those deepest questions about the meaning of life and of death.

As Christians, the more we fail to understand these ultimate desires and longings, the more we are unable to comprehend and communicate this unifying vision of reality that finds its ultimate source in God. We remain trapped in this crisis of interpretation.

And so we need to learn how to enter into conversations about the troubled search for love and lasting connection; we need to gain some understanding of the echoes, desires, and cultural imprints—this “humming.” We are not attempting to tell the story of God to a people lacking for nothing; we are simply attempting to tell a story that makes sense of, and gives true direction to, the longings that already exist. For those of us who live missionally, it’s our role, as well as our privilege, to point the seeker beyond the purely temporal and earthly to that which lies beyond … and to make the holy connections.

## What About Alex?

The last time I (Mark) saw “Alex from London” was on the day we arrived at our long-desired destination: the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela.

On completion of their journey, almost all the Camino hikers attend the noon Pilgrim’s Mass at the cathedral. It’s a majestic, serene, and holy experience … some might say “transcendent.” I entered the cathedral early and wandered around, appreciating the sense of history and the beauty of the architecture, and observing the hundreds of people as they filtered in for Mass. Almost unbelievably, as I walked down the center aisle toward the front of the church, I came upon Alex sitting by herself in a pew. We hadn’t crossed paths for the last few days, not since I had run into her on the street corner. She had her backpack next to her on the pew, and she was quietly weeping. I never was certain of the reason for her tears, but it apparently had something to do with the fact that the Mass administered that day was to be given in I talian, her grandmother’s native tongue. This moved her deeply, more than she could express; she felt it was in some way significant.

We talked for a moment, and then she said something that acknowledged a recognition and awareness of this God she had passionately denied just a few days before. Albeit very small, I believe it was a step toward belief.

She said, with a look of longing on her face, “You know, I live in a flat [apartment] in London that is right next to a church. I mean, right next to the church. I share a wall with them.” She then stood up and held her hand out, fingers extended, as if she was touching the wall. She looked at me, as if she was about to reveal something of great magnitude, and then said, “So, when I touch the wall like this, it’s kind of like I’m there, in church, with all those people who believe in God.” I looked at her, trying not to cry myself, and asked, “What do you think that means?” “I’m not sure,” she responded.

“Me, neither,” I said. “But I think all of this—your pilgrimage, your deep questions about your life and what you want to change, your tears—it has to mean something.” Alex didn’t say a word. But the look on her face of hope, wonder, questioning, and restlessness, all spoke of searching, of longing, and desire.

She simply turned and sat back down, her eyes fixed toward the front of the church.
