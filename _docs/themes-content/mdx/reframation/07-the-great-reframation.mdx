# Chapter 7: The Great Reframation

## (STEALING PAST THE WATCHFUL DRAGONS)

> God is the perfect poet Who in his person acts his own creations

## — ROBERT BROWNING

## Awe is the finest portion of mankind:

However scarce the world may make this sense —In awe one feels profoundly the immense.

— GOETHE “In our world,” said Eustace, “a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.” “Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is but only what it is made of.”

## — C. S. LEWIS

The Chronicles of Narnia, the classic children’s literature books written by C. S. Lewis, are probably Lewis’ best-known works, having sold over 100 million copies. Set in the fictional world of Narnia, a fantasy world of talking animals, mythical beasts, and “a deeper magic still,”1 these seven books narrate the adventures of four siblings as they navigate the world of Narnia and its unfolding history.

Lewis, an Oxford scholar, literary critic, lay theologian, and Christian apologist, was often asked why he would bother to write a series of children’s books. He responded by bemoaning how the parochial moralism of Sunday School religion effectively snuffed out his faith by teaching rational ideas about God and prescribing how exactly one ought to feel about, and how one ought to respond to, God.2 This doctrinaire religion and clichéd reverence effectively quenched any natural desire for God he’d once had as a child and therefore did much more harm than good. He likened these obstacles to living faith as fearsome dragons that stand guard at the door of every human heart, securing it against any real apprehension of God or any authentic faith. They have to be bypassed to find a true knowledge of God. Lewis suggested that stories, because of their indirection and appeal to the imagination, allow us to sneak past these spiritual inhibitions (the dragons). The Narnia stories were Lewis’ attempt to do this:

> But supposing that by casting all these things into an imaginary world,
> stripping them of their stained-glass and Sunday School associations, one
> could make them for the first time appear in their real potency? Could
> Stories steal past the watchful dragons because they require what Lewis
> listener; this openness on the part of the reader or listener is what makes

> gates of our perceptions are closed.

Contrast that with listening to a story. When we gather before the fire to hear a great story, we suspend our watchfulness. The guards are removed and the gates are left open. Things do not seem as suspicious when communicated in a narrative. But as we’ve already seen, stories are also brimming with realities and truths that can be incredibly potent, even life changing. We nod our heads in agreement, laugh out loud, and silently empathize with the characters. Good, beautiful stories plunge the reader into a fictional world in such a way that when they return to reality, they perceive the world with more clarity and joy than before.4 Not only does story enliven and enrich the familiar, it is also one of the fastest and most effective ways to penetrate the human heart. This is simply how we are wired, and no one knew it better than Jesus.5 Lewis’ Narnia was therefore not an escape from reality. Far from it; like all good stories it stimulated the (re)discovery of what is more real.

Through story, Lewis brought true things to light that were either previously undiscovered, or that had been veiled by the familiarity of the everyday.

Narnia helps both child and adult find new joy and delight in God and his story. It teaches about God’s great sacrifice, friendship, courage, and faithfulness in ways that mere facts about them never could. Story activates the light in our minds and imaginations that illuminates reality, enabling us to see more clearly the things that were already there.

Narrative, with its elements of myth, drama, and poetry, offers us an indirect way of communicating truth—one that requires the listener to engage their imagination and fill in the blanks. This is precisely the power of the parable and the stories that Jesus relied on to communicate the Word. Stories are not just telling truth “straight,” but “slant,” as Emily Dickinson suggested we must:

> Tell all the Truth but tell it slant— Success in Circuit lies
> Too bright for our infirm Delight
> The Truth’s superb surprise
> The Truth must dazzle gradually

## Telling the Better Story

We hope you now realize that our desire in this book is to wrestle with the same questions Lewis sought to address in writing the Chronicles of

> Narnia. How might we steal past those watchful dragons in the hearts of
> people around us in order to proclaim a story of God that makes sense to
> the pilgrims on the Camino, the Playa, and everywhere in between? How
> communicated to others in its real potency?

In this path forward, past these watchful dragons, we hope you now can appreciate the challenges we face: the twenty-first-century church is lacking in method and language in its articulation of God to pilgrims throughout the world. We may well have the desire and passion to eliminate the reductions, as well as the biblical knowledge needed to engage others. We may even have the grace and compassion required to converse with anyone from anywhere. Yet for all our desire, knowledge, and compassion, something in our approach is still woefully lacking; something is desperately missing. We seem powerless to communicate a story of God in its real potency.

Where might we finally turn? (This is the place where that “go-to” Sunday School answer for every question comes into play.) Of course, the answer is Jesus: Jesus told a better story. Jesus told a beautiful story. Astory not “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” but rather rich with both. He did not eclipse or dilute or flatten or trivialize. There was no reduction of truth, story, or life.

In Telling the Truth: The Gospel as Tragedy, Comedy and Fairy Tale, Frederick Buechner says that when Jesus spoke, he spoke “not in the incendiary rhetoric of the revolutionary or the systematic abstractions of the theologian but in the language of images and metaphor, which is finally the only language you can use if you want not just to elucidate the hidden thing but to make it come alive.” Buechner goes on to say: What is the kingdom of God? He [Jesus] does not speak of a reorganization of society as a political possibility or of the doctrine of salvation as a doctrine. He speaks of what it is like to find a diamond ring that you thought you’d lost forever. He speaks of what it is like to win the Irish Sweepstakes. He suggests rather than spells out. He evokes rather than explains. He catches by surprise. He doesn’t let the homiletic seams show. He is sometimes cryptic, sometimes obscure, sometimes irreverent, always provocative. He tells stories. He speaks in parables.9

> In Mark’s gospel, Jesus explains to his disciples why he uses stories:
> “You’ve been given insight into God’s kingdom—you know how it works.

But to those who can’t see it yet, everything comes in stories, creating readiness, nudging them toward receptive insight. These are people— Whose eyes are open but don’t see a thing, Whose ears are open but don’t understand a word, Who avoid making an about-face and getting forgiven.

[…] With many stories like these, he presented his message to them, fitting the stories to their experience and maturity. He was never without a story when he spoke. When he was alone with his disciples, he went over everything, sorting out the tangles, untying the knots.

> (MARK 4:1 1 – 1 2, 3 3 – 3 4 M S G )
> Jesus spoke and tangles were sorted, knots were untied. Jesus spoke and
> things un/raveled.10 In telling parables, Jesus un/raveled a tradition and a

> together.11 Jesus brought to his hearers a new perspective of the story of God:
> (Matthew 5:18 MSG). Jesus reframed the story and it changed everything.

An essential part of our theological and missional task today is to participate in a similar reframing and to “tell this story as clearly as possible, and to allow it to subvert other ways of telling the story of the world.”12 We are to tell a subversive story. The philosopher I van I llich was once asked about the most effective way to change society. He responded brilliantly by saying,

Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into the future so that we can take the next step forward. If you want to change a society, then you have to tell an alternative story.13 Jesus brought about a reframation by telling a subversive, alternative story.

He told a story that is more than science, more than history, more than philosophy, more than anthropology, and more than morality. Astory that not only happened once, but is happening still. “Like every truly great story, its truth may lie not so much in its historical or even philosophical veracity as in its effect on the soul of the reader.”14 Ah, the soul. Yes, the great power is seen in its effect upon the soul.

Reframing the story is more than communicating cute little quips or using tools to disseminate a poorly explained exegetical hypothesis. This reframing is not simply about finding a new remedy to help the medicine go down. This is about communicating a soul-shaping paradigm to the twenty-eight-year-old social studies teacher on the trail in Melide, Spain, and the forty-eight-year-old mostly naked artist on the desert plain in Black Rock City... and everyone in between.

To do this, the current approach to our articulation of the sacred needs a few primary alterations. We need some new frames.

> Lo O K I N G T H R O U G H R E / E N C H A N T E D F R A M E S
> Throughout the previous chapters, we have contended that our culture has
> experienced a move away from an openness to all things divine, to a more
> has brought about a hollow disenchantment and a crisis of interpretation,
> the God of creation and his purposes for the world.

For the sake of review, we believe this disenchantment has been brought about by:

- demystifying—by eliminating mystery, wonder, love, and awe from

the equation of how humans can rightly approach and know God

- depoeticizing—through dangerously narrowing our perceptive

range and linguistic capacity to talk about God, and subsequently reducing theology to rational code and religious formula

- demythologizing—through shrinking revelation to reduced-to-fit,

anti-supernatural, atheistic presuppositions about life.

We want to propose a re/enchantment in how we articulate our faith in God.

To recover that which has been lost, there needs to be a REmystifying, a REpoeticizing, and a REmythologizing, which will result, with apologies to the protestant reformers of the sixteenth century, in a “Great Reframation.”

## Remystify

It is because of the desire to name, categorize, and control God that the plague of demystification has crept into our faith dialogues. As we stated in chapter two, the premodern world was mindful of enchantment and of mystery. However, we have now transitioned to a faith culture rarely open to the mysteries of the divine. Many hold the belief that if they cannot catalog and systemize their encounters with the divine, they must not be real.

So how might we steal past these watchful dragons and bring forth a sense of mystery, awe, and wonder, and an openness to the sacred elements of life once again? How do we nudge awake a world that seems to have overslept? How do we move a culture, which participates in the numbing of the senses, toward a state of wonderment? How do we move them closer to what Abraham Heschel refers to as radical amazement?

## Asked for Wonder

The starting place for this remystification is the recovery of wonder. This moves us away from the oversimplified “spiritual v religious” discussion and into a different depth of conversation. Anthropologist Dr. Mary Catherine Bateson says, “Wonder can take you into science. It can take you into art. Other human beings are amazing and beautiful. The natural world around us; the more we study it, the more fascinating and intricate and elegant it turns out to be. Which is my interpretation of the Book of Job incidentally.”17 To Bateson’s point, the character of Job, in what is called “the greatest poem of ancient and modern times,” suffers unspeakable pain and loss.18 His cries of “Why?” fall upon deaf ears (both his friends’ and God’s) until chapters 38–41, when God gives the most curious of responses: Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?

Tell me, if you have understanding.

Who determined its measurements—surely you know!

Or who stretched the line upon it?

Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth?

Declare, if you know all this.

> Who has cut a channel for the torrents of rain, and a way for the thunderbolt,
> to bring rain on a land where no one lives,
> on the desert, which is empty of human life,
> and to make the ground put forth grass?

Do you observe the calving of the deer?

Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth, when they crouch to give birth to their offspring, and are delivered of their young?

> JOB 3 8:4–5, 18, 2 5 – 2 7, 3 9:1 – 3 N RS V
> These chapters give the impression that God is preparing Job for a natural
> history exam. But, as Bateson says, “That’s not really what it is. I think the He’s respectable, he obeys all the rules, he’s complacent, he goes through the appropriate rituals that were required in his community at that time. But he has lost his sense of wonder. And then God says, ‘Look. Just look. Realize how incredibly amazing it is. How incredibly complex it all is.’”19 Beautiful and complicated; awe-inspiring and overwhelming. Job asked God 210 questions and in return God asks Job seventy-eight. In fact, in the entirebook, Job received no answers. Just question after question from God, enabling Job to recognize his “appropriate size,” which then prompted an “appropriate response”: I’m speechless, in awe—words fail me (Job 40: 4 MSG).

I’ll cover my mouth with my hand, for I’ve already said too much (Job 40:4 The Voice).

And now I see that I spoke of—but did not comprehend—great wonders that are beyond me. I didn’t know (Job 42:3 The Voice).

This sense of mystery and awe in the presence of the sheer majesty of God needs to be cultivated if we are to see something of the glory of the Lord. Von Balthasar notes that, unless a person is acquainted with trembling awe that reaches down to the very ground of one’s being—what the Bible calls the “fear of God”—they are not yet ready for the contemplation of Jesus Christ.

> Contemplation [of God] starts at the point where the believing mind
> begins to perceive a dawning light in the abyss of the mystery, where the
> mystery begins to reveal itself in all its vast proportions. Not in the sense
> astonishment which reaches to the very roots of our being. For we must
> all the experience of God accessible to natural man and man as he is in
> Anyone contemplating the life of Jesus needs to be more deeply aware every
> God, in his absolute Otherness, chose to manifest himself in a very specific

When we come before this God, revealed in Jesus, we ought to feel scandalized; we must feel our minds reeling, the very ground giving way beneath our feet. We must at least experience that “ecstasy” of noncomprehension that transported Jesus’ contemporaries (Mark 2:12; 6:51). They were amazed, beside themselves, stupefied, overwhelmed; their sense of normal reason abandoned them (literally). And this happened again and again (cf. Matthew 7:28; 12:23; 13:54; Luke 2:48; 4:32; 8:56; 9:43, etc.). “In the gospel, anyone who encounters Christ is impelled either to worship him or to pick up stones with which to stone him. Evidently, the gospel does not foresee any other kind of response.”21 We need to learn to present a God that none of us expect or anticipate. AGod that takes our breath away, whether in awe, astonishment or surprise.

How many of us are simply telling a story about connecting the dots with three understandable homiletical points formed acrostically, followed by a nice, neat conclusion? Instead, a true articulation of the good news should leave us breathless. Our goal should not be that people walk away from an encounter with the gospel with all their questions answered. Instead, we should be learning to ask the right questions and to enter into an everdeeper, awe-inspiring mystery.

It is critical that we recover wonder and astonishment at the sheer truth of God and the gospel if we are to reframe our sense of God and the world.

It is by acknowledging the ever-greatness of God that we gain more insight into him. We need to remystify the Truth so that it reveals itself, yet again, to wonder.

Abraham Heschel believed that wonder and awe are “an intuition for the dignity and preciousness of all things,” “a way of understanding into a meaning greater than ourselves,” and “an opening to transcendence” … all things for which pilgrims trying to find their way are searching.24 Can followers of Jesus wake up to the concept of mystery and communicate a God that is not a result of accumulated knowledge but instead is the source of our wonder?

## Repoeticize

It is a great tragedy that much of the articulations of the sacred have been labeled, at times proudly, “destitute of poetry and barren of imagination” (again, see chapter two). Part of the purpose of this book is to plead with those of us who tell the sacred story to a better use of words, a deeper use of language, a resurrection of imagination, and a reinvigoration of poetry. Even though the majority of biblical text is composed of narrative and poetry, today’s faith conversations have largely been closed to a deeper experience of the divine by the exclusion of both. This in turn has meant that our vocabulary, the language we use to share meaning, has been stripped of any hints of divine Eros, or of passionate yearning for God.

We can no longer hear, see, recognize, or experience the depth of God and his good news.

How might we overcome the prosaic nature of our current framing of the sacred? And can we communicate a theology that is open to voices, expressions, and language that fall outside the range of our present, reduced reality?

In the 1950s, Amos Wilder, a theology professor, minister, and poet, wrote a work called Theopoetic: Theology and the Religious Imagination, which wasn’t published until 1974. Wilder served in World War I and, upon his return, attempted to continue a similar kind of theological work and practice to the one he had engaged with prior to going away. Yet, the world, his friends, his community, and he himself, had changed so much that he was unable to continue as he had done before; the current theological understanding and practice was not connecting with the longings and desires of those he was meeting day after day. In response, Wilder began to explore what kind of theology might make sense to someone who had just experienced World War I.

In his attempt to address what was missing, he began writing about this need to pay more attention to the role of imagination and language—what he called the theopoetic. He wrote: It is at the level of the imagination that the fateful issues of our new world-experience must first be mastered. It is here that culture and history are broken, and here that the church is polarized. Old words do not reach across the new gulfs, and it is only in vision and oracle that we can chart the unknown and new-name the creatures. Before the message there must be the vision, before the sermon the hymn, before the prose the poem. 25

Theologian Walter Brueggemann exhorts the church to make use of poetry, rather than flattening out all the images and metaphors to make the story of God fit into a nice but lifeless formulation.

This is why the poetry is so important; because the poetry just keeps opening and opening and opening whereas the doctrinal practice of the church is always to close and close and close until you’re left with nothing that has transformative power. So we have to communicate to people, that if you want an experience of God that is healthier than that, you’re going to have to take time to sit with the biblical metaphors and poetic images, to relish them and allow them to become a part of your prayer life and to seep into your very vocabulary and your conceptual frame.27

## Wakening the Mind

It has been an assumption of the disenchanted modern worldview (scientism) of the last few hundred years that, by setting aside things like art, metaphor, and imagination, humanity would finally be able to get to a logical, mathematical simplicity that is the truth. Because we live within this cultural milieu, our theology—our capacity to talk and think about God—has been similarly disenchanted. The Western church, by opting for a supposedly scientific-critical technique, has likewise ended up with a notion of objective truth that is by definition free of poetry and imagination—the kind of theology that is developed by using the same type of technical process required to make computers or washing powder. We have spent decades searching for meaning, looking for new information, new arguments, or new procedures in order to create the latest in theological technology. We have lost the capacity to read and understand both the world and the Word poetically—through the power of living the metaphor.

Eugene Peterson suggested that poets offer a reframing, a new way of seeing, a new way of experiencing. They awaken us from what has become familiar, dragging us “into the depth of reality itself.” Poets don’t simply tell us about something; they force us “into the middle of it. Poetry grabs for the jugular. Far from being cosmetic language, it is intestinal. It is root language. Poetry doesn’t so much tell us something we never knew as bring into recognition what is latent, forgotten, overlooked, or suppressed.”28 Repoeticizing therefore is not about new ways to collect and disseminate information but instead about putting a new frame around a picture. We need to recover poetry instead of just the prosaic; imagination instead of mere information. In adopting the language of poetry and imagination, we recapture the language of intimacy and experience. Poetic speech is not intended to be an explanation, it is not a fanciful way to illustrate; rather, it invokes imagination. It makes an image of reality in such a way as to invite our participation in it. We are not necessarily more informed by it, but we will have more experience.

Poets are extravagant and bold, scorning both the caution of the religious philosopher and the earnestness of the ethical moralist. [In Revelation] St. John is a poet, using words to intensify our relationship with God. He is not trying to get us to think more accurately or to train us into better behavior, but to get us to believe more recklessly, behave more playfully— the faith-recklessness and hope-playfulness of children entering into the kingdom of God. He will jar us out of our lethargy, get us to live on the alert, open our eyes to the burning bush and fiery chariots, open our ears to the hard-steel promises and commands of Christ, banish boredom from the gospel, lift up our heads, enlarge our hearts.29 Walter Brueggemann even goes as far as to say, “Poetic speech is the only proclamation worth doing in a situation of reductionism.”30 Spot on. This is because metaphors open up new ways of seeing and perceiving God. Poetry is the language that is used throughout the biblical narrative, especially among the prophets. Those wild-eyed Hebrew prophets spoke the word of God to a people who no longer understood the presence of God or his relentless pursuit. They came with very little experience, even fewer credentials, but having listened to God and studied culture, they spoke to the people. With poetic rhetoric the prophets spoke a subversive and alternative story. They spoke with a prophetic imagination, taking what they knew about the world in front of them and envisioning a completely different story being lived out. This is the task of those called to speak about the sacred, to articulate the alternative world God has promised, and that he is in fact birthing at any given time.

Consider Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech as an example of prophetic poetics. This was a history-making speech, calling its hearers to an alternative way of life. Yet King didn’t employ the technical language of civil rights legislation, though it had everything to do with that. He didn’t give his hearers information—he awakened a yearning in their hearts for justice.31 Again, the solution is not a simple change in aesthetic. It is not decorative.

It is not frivolous. It is not simply reading or speaking more poetry. It is a radical shift in our rhetoric that includes a language that is deeper, richer, more steeped in metaphor, and more dynamic; speech that touches heart and soul, as well as the mind. This is not a call to simply create a new and improved doctrinal statement. It is instead a call to embrace a theological language that fully engages the current world as it is—not a new revelation but a new frame, which offers an opportunity for a new response. Because, as Shelley said, “Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar.”32 Theological poetry even more so.

C. S. Lewis’ advice to would-be interpreters of the Bible is to let the figurative speech of the Bible speak for itself and not try to reduce it to theological formulas or to literalize it. He recommended two basic rules for exegesis: first, never take the metaphors literally. Second, when the significance of the poetic images—what they say to our fear, hope, will, and affections—seems to conflict with any theological abstractions we might adhere to, trust the essence and intention of the images every time.

Lewis suggested that whatever revelatory information the poetic language in the Scriptures has to confer can be received only if the interpreter is ready to meet it halfway. Abstract theology, he proposed, is not likely to be more adequate than the sensuous, organic, and personal images of Scripture—light and darkness, river and well, seed and harvest, master and servant, hen and chickens, father and child. Lewis also claimed that it is an act of intellectual impertinence to ask a text to deliver assurances in the propositional language of theologians when it is written in the evocative language of poetry. Besides, Lewis rightly maintained that abstract thinking is itself simply a tissue of analogies and metaphors: an abstract reframing of spiritual reality in legal, chemical, or mechanical terms.33 The willingness to repoeticize opens us up to a deepening and wi-l] dening of God and gospel that leaves us vulnerable and receptive to a truth we have all sought to avoid time and again.

## Remythologize

Remythologization essentially involves a reinsertion of what, we believe, is a way of making sense in a senseless world. It is more like tasting than thinking; something that transcends a finite understanding of this world and miraculously gives vision to see the entire world beyond a limited reality.

Again, as a review from chapter two, we are not using the term myth in its pop/vernacular definition—to describe a false belief, a legend, or a baseless superstition. Neither is our use of the term about simply using some clever and engaging tale, told to entertain or distract, but rather it’s a way of wrapping truth in a narrative in order to convey primal truths to its readers.

We use the term in exactly the same way C. S. Lewis did, who himself wrote material that had huge mythic resonance. Lewis understood myth as a descriptive term to identify the dimension of literature that is “extraliterary,” a dimension that contains something derived from beyond the written words themselves. Awork that contains mythological elements will draw a reader out of himself or herself and into something greater.34 Lewis claimed that to say a story is mythic is not to say it is mere fantasy.

Quite the opposite. By appealing to the power of myth, we give ordinary, everyday things new life and meaning. This is because myth reaches into the innermost levels of human consciousness. It resonates with us because of its universal and fundamental truth.35 In our search for meaning in a somewhat confused and despairing world, myths are indispensable in giving us a “reframed” language, full of meaning, beauty, and hope. Myth is a way of thinking and speaking that gives us truth about the world and ourselves. Mythic language can help us wrestle with questions of self-identity, and tribe-identity, while giving us a road to walk as we sort through the unfathomable mysteries of the world.

## A Unifying Vision of Reality

It was the nature of myth that was at the center of a now renowned discussion between friends on a late-night stroll on September 19, 1931. On the picturesque path known as Addison’s Walk on the grounds of Oxford’s Magdalen College, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Hugo Dyson took a transformative walk that included an exploration into the nature of myth.

Lewis, having professed atheism since a teenager, had become a theist in the years leading up to 1931. Naturally a skeptic, he had come to believe in a God of sorts, but: Lewis explained that his difficulty had been that he could not see “how the life and death of Someone Else (whoever he was) 2000 years ago could help us here and now.” He could admit that Christ might provide a good example, but that was about as far as it went. Lewis realized that the New Testament took a very different view, using terms such as propitiation, or sacrifice to refer to the true meaning of the cross. But these expressions, Lewis declared, seemed to him to be “either silly or shocking.” 36 Lewis and Tolkien shared a love of mythology, but up to this point, it had not helped Lewis come to terms with the story of the gospel. Years before, he had concluded that Christianity was simply “one mythology among many” and was as false as all other religions. But that short walk that night in 1931 seemed to play a crucial part in the story of Lewis, the selfdescribed “most reluctant convert.”37 Alister Mc Grath in his extraordinary biography of Lewis writes: Tolkien helped Lewis to realize that the problem lay not in Lewis’ rational failure to understand the theory, but in his imaginative failure to grasp its significance. The issue was not primarily about truth, but about meaning.

When engaging the Christian narrative, Lewis was limiting himself to his reason when he ought to be opening himself to the deepest intuitions of his imagination.38 Tolkien argued and reasoned, and Lewis came to the following understanding: “The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened.”39 “To put it another way, just as Christ came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, so he came not to put an end to myth but to take all that is most essential in the myth up into himself and make it real.”40 Mc Grath continues: For Tolkien […] Myths offer a fragment of that truth, not its totality.

They are like splintered fragments of the true light. Yet when the full and true story is told, it is able to bring to fulfillment all that was right and wise in those fragmentary visions of things. For Tolkien, grasping Christianity’s meaningfulness took precedence over its truth. It provided the total picture, unifying and transcending these fragmentary and imperfect insights. For Tolkien, a myth awakens in its readers a longing for something that lies beyond their grasp. Myths possess an innate capacity to expand the consciousness of their readers, allowing them to transcend themselves. At their best, myths offer what Lewis later termed “a real though unfocused gleam of divine truth falling on human imagination.” Christianity, rather than being one myth alongside many others, is thus the fulfillment of all previous mythological religions. Christianity tells a true story about humanity, which makes sense of all the stories that humanity tells about itself.”41 Lewis was thus radically reframed. No longer to just be understood in its technical literary sense, myth now opened a door for him, one that God seemed to chase him through. He wrote just days after this conversation with Tolkien and Dyson: “I have just passed on from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ—in Christianity.”42 Suddenly, there was a way of integrating the desires and longings that Lewis felt with the reasonable reality of this “true myth.” This reframing of myth and of faith allowed Lewis to understand the potential for the merging of the world of reason and imagination.

For this is the marriage of heaven and earth: Perfect Myth and Perfect Fact: claiming not only our love and obedience, but also our wonder and delight, addressed to the savage, the child, and the poet in each one of us no less than to the moralist, the scholar, and the philosopher.43 Is it possible for us to do the same thing in our telling of the story of God?

To spend our time less in confirming the veracity of Christianity and more in exhibiting its unifying vision of reality? This would mean a merging of the world of reason and imagination, a synthesizing of science with arts that would bring to fruition something of an imaginative apologetics. It is the imagination that opens our capacity to apprehend meaning and it is this larger view of reality that eliminates the reduced, flattened, and trivial telling of the gospel.

## Life Is A Cabaret

If all this talk about poetry and the imagination seems foreign to evangelical ears, then we need only listen to Paul as he encourages the Ephesian saints to “be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 5: 18–20).

I (Alan) was recently pondering what “speaking to one another in hymns and spiritual songs” could possibly mean? Was Paul really suggesting that we live our lives like a Broadway musical? (I hope not, as musicals are by no means my favorite art form!) But it certainly sounds like it. Paul does seem to be suggesting that we are not to just sing songs in congregational worship, but rather we are to converse as if we were singing to each other. This requires cultivating a hymnic form of speech that derives its sensibilities from the Old Testament Psalms as well as the New Testament hymns (e. g., Colossians 1; Ephesians 1:1–10; Philippians 2:5–11, etc.). By urging them to live their lives inside the metaphor of a spiritual song, Paul is encouraging the saints to live within the enchanted world where the Spirit-inspired mystery and awe inspires a life of thanksgiving.

The always-insightful Adrienne von Speyr agrees: If Paul expresses the wish that we might live in the fullness of the Spirit so that he rules in a living way our whole life […] we must make a personal effort to converse with one another in the language of the Spirit […] It is from this source that we are to draw our thoughts and mental occupations, so that what we communicate to others may be, not of us, but of God.

The words we use to converse with God must also give their characteristic stamp to the words we use in our Christian conversation with one another.

In this way both we ourselves as well as our interlocutors are placed in an atmosphere of God […] But if psalms and hymns give their imprint to our everyday speech, the words we have at our disposal to explain ourselves become ever more lively and appropriate. Not, as it were, by imposing from above a sort of foreign vocabulary on our everyday speech, but by impressing on our entire daily life the sense of the psalms and hymns and thus accustoming our quotidian reality to the supernatural world in virtue of the word of God that is contained in these spiritual songs. Our human intercourse is thereby blown wide open.44 The language of the psalms (and hymns) is theopoetic speech laden with a sense of mystery and wonder, dread and love, suffering and joy, desire and longing—in a word, pathos. When we speak to one another with this kind of speech, it opens one up to the presence of God and gospel in fresh and new ways. This is why we are encouraging the reader to repoeticize, remystify, and remythologize our ways of speaking about God.

And if anyone is given to think that this piece of Pauline advice is a tad too poetical for Paul, we suggest simply reading the first chapters of Ephesians and Colossians to experience Paul’s own poetic worldview at play. Our standard readings of Paul are captive to the scholastics and rationalists who use him to do their theological accounting. But this is a reduction of the Pauline gospel by particular theological interest groups.

Paul is way too mystical to be a rationalist (see 2 Corinthians 12:1–4, for instance), and he knows full well that the only way one can really express the in/credible things God has done is through poetic language and songs!45

## Re-Dig The Wells

In Genesis 26, a very obscure story is told of I saac. I saac, of course, is the son of Abraham, whom God covenanted with to make a great nation. After Abraham’s death, and during the time of a famine in the land, I saac settled in the Valley of Gerar. God blessed I saac, like his father before him, with “flocks and herds and a great household” (Genesis 26:14 NASB). As would be expected, with so many to provide for, the need for water was great. But his nation’s adversary, the Philistines, had filled all the wells with earth.46 God’s people had no access to a major necessity of life.

In response to this great need, I saac “had to re-dig all of the water wells that his father had installed” (Genesis 26:18 The Voice). In order for the people to live, I saac had to clear the ground and cart off the debris, so that all that had cluttered and obstructed the flow of water from the wells was removed and the water could stream through once more.

He dug the wells again so that the people could drink deeply from that which gave life.

So much of the story of Jesus we tell similarly needs to be dug again.

And all the clutter and debris removed.

So that people can drink deeply of that which gives them life.

We can see examples of this “re-digging” of stories all across the cultural landscape. Stories and narratives that had grown “cluttered and obstructed” have been brought to life by, at times, a radical and far-reaching re-digging.

Consider the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton as a quintessential display of re-digging. Hamilton was a “founding father,” the creator of the nation’s financial system, and the first Secretary of the Treasury. Creator of the musical, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has taken Hamilton’s story and turned it into a musical phenomenon, endearing itself to the theatre community, and receiving a Grammy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, and eleven Tony Awards.

I ncorporating hip hop, R&B, pop, and soul, and casting non-white actors as the founding fathers, the show has also appealed to broader culture.

“I’m just doing what everyone else that’s writing musicals is doing,” says Miranda. “I’m finding a musical vocabulary to tell this story. For me, hip hop seems to be the only way to tell Alexander Hamilton’s story because it’s a story about words and it’s a story about using words to save your life and destroy your life.”47 Miranda did not change the story of Alexander Hamilton; he simply put a new frame around it.

But the church? Oi vey! The church thinks the answer is more puppet shows and nativity pageants (“we even have live animals this year”) that will proclaim the gospel and win the world to faith in God. Or perhaps a teaching series on NASCAR racing because it will appeal to men, the lost demographic. Please, please hear our cry. No more tawdry Jesus puppet shows! No more Bible dramas with bathrobes as costumes! And no more equating the death of Dale Earnhardt with the death of Jesus. Please! No more inferior art, no more dreadful attempts to tell such a magnificent story with such low-quality and artless craft. We must tell a better story as well as tell the story better; a story that brings about healing, transformation, societal change, and restoration. Are/enchanted story that surprises its hearers, both by uncovering brokenness and in giving hope.

This re/enchanting is what C. S. Lewis was attempting in the creation of the Chronicles of Narnia. It has been called an attempt at “rearranging reality.” “For Lewis, the narrative of Narnia has the capacity to re-enchant a disenchanted world. It helps us to imagine our world differently. This is not escapism, but is about discerning deeper levels of meaning and value in what we already know.”48 Walter Hooper tells a fascinating story about the illustrations created for The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, the first book in the Narnia series. Pauline Baynes, the illustrator hired by Lewis, had not discussed the content of the book with Lewis before beginning work on it, so she was not familiar with the story. Hooper recalls Baynes’ account: When she was drawing all those pictures of Aslan being tormented by the White Witch and others […] she had to rip up her paper again and again because she was weeping on the pages over the fate of Aslan. It just broke her heart. So, finally, she finished the illustrations and then sent them off to the publisher but even a week later still bothered by all that had happened to Aslan she found herself surprised when it suddenly broke on her: “Oh, I know who he is! He is Jesus Christ!” Just as Emily Dickinson advised, Lewis told the truth but told it “slant,” and the effect on Pauline Baynes was that it “dazzled gradually.”49 Hooper rightly states, "This is the way you get past the watchful dragons. You don't want a person to be told 'T his is Jesus Christ and I want you to see this before you begin the book.' No. Let it happen to you as it did to her. So when she actually takes in what Jesus has done for humanity then it will break up on her, ‘this really happened in a real world. And I am one of the beneficiaries of it.’”50 The real power seen in the effects of re/enchantment is not in the creative stories that are told, nor in the moralizing allegories that are revealed. The thing that gives the frames of re/enchantment their real power and meaning is the world they evoke, the transformation of life they demonstrate, and the hope they give. And if ever there was a time we needed a richer, broader, deeper story, it has to be now.

The question we are asking every follower of Jesus to wrestle with is this: is the story we are telling big enough, mysterious enough, poetic enough, and mythical enough to allow us to once again experience the reality of God beyond the clutter and debris of this world that gets in the way? Is it able to move the moon so we can experience God beyond the Eclipse, a God infinitely bigger than the small and insignificant being our hearts and minds have reduced him to.

It is the same story, about this same Jesus, that just a few dozen people began to tell over 2,000 years ago. This story reframed the love of God, and it literally changed the world. In/credible!

And there at the beginning, they allowed nothing to get in the way. No clutter, no debris filling up the well.

They simply told the story, lived the story, and drank deeply from its well.
