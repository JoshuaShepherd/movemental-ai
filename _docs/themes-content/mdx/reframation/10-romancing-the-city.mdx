# Chapter 10: Romancing the City

## (LIKE GETTING CAUGHT

## IN THE RAIN)

If the signals of transcendence have become rumors in our time, then we can set out to explore these rumors—and perhaps to follow them up to their source.

Being incarnational is like making love.

Being incarnational is like candlelit dinners.

Being incarnational is like Piña Coladas and getting caught in the rain.

## — MICHAEL FROST

> In quite possibly the most painfully excruciating eight minutes of film ever
> recorded, Prince Charles (Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the British
> throne) was interviewed in 1981 alongside his newly announced fiancée,
> and Diana’s attempt to describe their courtship and pending nuptials

> immediately, “Of course.” In contrast, the ever-starchy Charles, fourteen
> dispassionate of ways, “Well, I suppose so... whatever being in love
> would have immediately realized: poor Diana should have run away as fast

This “Prince Charles way of thinking” is similar to the wife who asks the husband, “But, darling, do you love me?” to which the man replies, “Of course I love you. I married you, didn’t I? I told you at the ceremony that I loved you, and if I changed my mind, I’d let you know. What more do you need from me? We had a ceremony, didn’t we?” It effectively communicates that the grand gesture and declaration of a wedding says and does all that needs to be said and done.

As we grow in relationship with others, we must acknowledge that any proclamation in word and deed must go deeper than grand gestures and declarations. In helping people look for love in the right places, we must learn to court those we encounter. Ultimately, what we are trying to articulate is this: the church cannot continue proclaiming the good news of Jesus in the same way Prince Charles approached love and marriage.2

> OFSPEEDDAt ESANDONE-NIGHTSTa NDS

As we have described in chapters four and five, we lack true understanding of our Camino and Burning Man pilgrims because we fail to get to know them; we tend to exegete Scripture pretty well while failing miserably at exegeting the culture/s in which we are immersed. This is like going on multiple first dates, all of which rarely make it past introductions and an appetizer, and should probably be described as “speed dating evangelism.” Hardly the way of Jesus, who loved the world so much that he moved into the neighborhood for thirty years and no one noticed! Following this (incarnational) way of love, we simply have to find ways to romance our culture, to lovingly engage with the hearts of people who have no real idea how wide and deep an experience of God can be. We must move toward something deeper than a cursory announcement and proclamation of love, void of relationship.

Consider my (Mark) first date with my wife of thirty-one years, Monica.

My attempt to woo her included all the extravagancies a twenty-two-yearold college senior could muster: I was clad in my best, and only, polo shirt which, by the way, I had ironed for the occasion (a grand gesture indeed for someone who had never used an iron before); I had packed a picnic basket replete with the only food I knew how to prepare on a grill (hamburgers and corn on the cob); and we spent the entire day in the beautiful Great Smoky Mountains National Park, including watching the sunset in the extraordinarily gorgeous Cades Cove. It was an unbelievable fifteen-hour Romancing the City 175 start to a relationship with the greatest person I have ever known. And yet, as grand a gesture as that first date had been—including the monumental accomplishment of ironing not only my shirt but my plaid pastel shorts as well—it was just the beginning. I had to learn many other ways to win her heart. I had to learn the subtle and romantic art of wooing.

Similarly, we fear that too many depend upon grand evangelistic gestures to “win souls for Jesus.” (“Of course we love you, we planted a church for you, didn’t we? … Yes, we are devoted to the community. We’ve built this multi-purpose building for you to come to. It even has a food court.”) Many of us are unwilling to engage in the loving work of “wooing people to Jesus” that is necessary in our post-Christian world. The telling of the good news cannot simply be about the grand gesture, the ceremonial presentation. So, as we began the discussion in the last chapter, we continue to explore some basic practices that must occur if we are to move beyond the lip service of a prescriptive gospel story, and into rhythms that will help us plumb the depths of the image of God buried deep within us all.

We want to suggest that the idea of romancing your city—a metaphor first suggested by Michael Frost—is an incredibly useful way of approaching incarnational mission with an eye to winning the love of the person/people we are seeking to reach. What will it take to romance a culture well? What has to happen for a relationship to be developed that could transform both parties? We propose it is the same thing it takes to go beyond a first date: we will need to find the keys to the beloved’s heart, to attend, to court, to woo, with the intention of marriage, for better or worse, richer or poorer.

It will require a willingness to learn about and to understand someone else, a willingness to consciously stop talking about yourself and what only you believe for a moment. And it will require stepping outside your own cultural box and learning to ask questions about the other—simple, genuinely curious questions, not ones designed to lead someone to your cleverly designed agenda for the relationship, but instead, questions that lead to a genuine understanding of the other. Those who are the worst at romance are those who have not learned how to simply pay attention, listen, and interpathize (we will explain this term later). We need to develop some rhythms and practices, which we will now explore.

## The Art of Paying Attention

One of the most significant missional leaders in Australia (and a mentor and friend of Alan’s) was a man named John Smith. Aprolific activist, communicator, and missionary, John engaged in many schools, pubs, motorcycle gangs, Parliament, and anything in between. I (Alan) clearly remember John talking about prevenient grace and telling stories to a packed room full of young leaders at a conference (of which I was one)— stories about how he made it his practice to find out what God was doing in the odd and edgy places of our culture.

John told a story of how one day, after speaking at one such large event, a young woman approached him and told him she had been profoundly moved by what he had said and she very much needed to talk further about Jesus and his meaning for her life.3 Unfortunately, the event had gone on too long and she, somewhat enthralled by his message, realized she was late for work, so she begged John to meet with her later that evening so they could talk further.

Always a passionate evangelist, he of course agreed. She then thrust a piece of paper in his hand, asking him to meet her at that address, and then she ran off.

Later, when he checked the note, he realized he had just agreed to meet her at one of the city’s most notorious strip clubs. He decided to go nonetheless.

(And while he did go alone, there were some legitimate reasons, and so we ask that you suspend your judgment here.) At the strip club, he found a table, and asked the waitress to get Linda (not her real name). When the waitress returned, she brought him a drink but sans Linda. He told her that he had been asked to meet Linda there that night. The waitress, still not believing the story, asked for his name. When he told her his name was John Smith, she replied, “Oh yeah, sure, everyone is called ‘John Smith’ in this place.” Eventually, however, he persuaded her to get Linda.

When Linda arrived, she thanked John profusely for coming to this risqué place and began to tell him the story of her life: She had always loved dancing and always wanted to be a performer. At seventeen she met a young Christian guy and fell in love. At some point, he had taken her to hear John at his local church to hear him preach, and that day she became a Christian. However, things were not all well; her boyfriend came from an ultraconservative denomination that looked down on all types of activities as “worldliness,” especially dancing in any form, and not long after, the parents forced the young man to end their relationship on those grounds.

It was dancing or teenage love. Because of her deep sense of calling, she chose dancing, but having to make this choice devastated Linda. Believing all Christians to be soul-crushing legalists, she subsequently gave up on the church and on Christians, and devoted herself to a career in dancing.

Now, life is difficult for professional dancers and she, like many in the arts, struggled to find work in her chosen calling. But following her longing Romancing the City 177 to dance, and against her better judgment, she ended up stripping for a living. It was not the best solution, but she explained adamantly that she was not a prostitute and that the leering men could not touch her, and well, at least here, she could dance … and get paid for it.

She talked to John about her family, her dreams, Jesus, and the meaning of life, and that she felt it was time for her to come back to Jesus. When the time came for her to do her strip dance, she turned to John and, while acknowledging that it was a lot to ask, she asked him to stay and watch her performance because it had everything to do with the story of her life. John thought this was taking it a bit far, but again Linda prevailed, and he stayed for her performance. The choice of song was a beautifully mournful melody by Janis Ian called “Only Seventeen.” The song is all about rejection and being an “ugly duckling.” Linda had actually woven the story of her loss of faith into her strip act … her “art.” Later that night, John had the privilege and joy of praying with Linda about a “coming home in the faith,” right there in the strip club.

Now I (Alan) remember being in that room full of enthralled young leaders as John recounted this story. I still remember the stunned silence as John then asked a question, one that in a moment changed my entire perspective of mission: “Was Jesus in that strip club that night?” Can God be found in that place of tragedy and brokenness, and in others like them? There is no other biblical answer than, “Yes, of course.” We now found ourselves on the horns of a dilemma: if this was so, that God really was in that place, wooing Linda to himself through Jesus Christ, is it all right for us as God’s people to join him in his mission in these places?

And again, I believe we are forced to affirm that it is not only possible, but that it is necessary that some of God’s people join him in these so-called “godforsaken” places of the city.

Now be sure, the point we want to make here is not that all believers should go to strip clubs and evangelize strippers. That’s incidental to the real (God) story going on in the narrative. The question that must drive us is whether we can join with God in his mission—learning to pay attention in whatever place we find ourselves.

## Find Out What God Is Already Doing

Jesus said, "The truth is that the Son does nothing on His own; all these actions are led by the Father. The Son watches the Father closely and then mimics the work of the Father" (John 5:19 The Voice). In other words, when Jesus goes to the pub or to the market (or to the strip club for that matter), he is always looking for what the Father is already doing, and he subsequently joins the Father in what he is already doing. And we believe this is exactly what we need to do when engaging in any and every context of life.

Finding God everywhere is at the core of a missional spirituality rooted in our growing awareness that God can be found in every person, in every place, and in all things. This means we must pay attention. We must learn to become aware of what it is God is doing and where it is that he is doing it. Again, in the words of Jesus, “I have not ever acted, and will not in the future act, on My own. I listen to the directions of the One who sent Me and act on these divine instructions. For this reason, My judgment is always fair and never self-serving. I’m committed to pursuing God’s agenda and not My own” (John 5:30 The Voice).

Recognizing this pattern in the life of Jesus, Brad Brisco notes that we often wrongly assume the primary activity of God is in the church.4 He says that the primary activity of God is in the world, and the church is the chief instrument created by God to be sent into the world to participate in what he is already doing. Therefore, instead of ministry being all about human ingenuity and what we can do for God, it is rather about discovering what God is already doing, and in light of our gifts and resources, discerning how he wants us to join him.5 Brad is not alone in speaking like this. In fact, here he is drawing deeply from the wells of our greatest missional theology.

For instance, Lesslie Newbigin reiterated that, while the kingdom of God is always present in the church, God’s sovereignty must never be allowed to become the domesticated possession of the church. “Mission is not simply the self-propagation of the church, on the contrary, the active agent of mission is a power that rules, guides, and goes before the church: the free, sovereign, living power of the Spirit of God.” Speaking from forty or so years of experience as a missionary to India, he notes that: Mission is not just something that the church does; it is something that is done by the Spirit, who is himself the witness, who changes both the world and the church, who always goes before the church in its missionary journey. It is therefore not enough to speak of the proclamation of the kingdom and of the presence of the kingdom; we must also speak of the prevenience, the previousness of the kingdom.6 The kingdom of God is prior to, and also beyond, the church. It is God’s rule and sovereignty over the entire universe. By definition it is not, and cannot Romancing the City 179 be, limited to the church. This means that when we begin to articulate good news to someone who does not yet believe, we can be assured that God has concerned himself with this person long before the would-be evangelist ever arrived. In fact, contextualization of the gospel depends as much on finding out how Christ is already active in the culture as it does on bringing Christ to the culture. The Bible affirms throughout that God is constantly at work in the world in many ways, in every time, and in different places.

“Evangelism is not about Christians working on God’s behalf because God is powerless without them. Effective evangelism must start with recognizing where God is already at work, and getting alongside God in what is going on there. God’s story, not ours, is the authentic starting point.”7 In fact, this theme of preparatory grace goes back to the early church in the teaching of the so-called praeparatio evangelica, that an anticipation of the Christian message can be found in all cultures and in every human heart.

The calling of those who follow Jesus is to lovingly attend to what God is doing and join in—bringing a little romance to those around them.

Darrell Guder agrees: Missionaries, beginning with the New Testament apostles and continuing today, constantly encounter the preparatory work of God’s Spirit when they enter into a new place. They do not bring the gospel: Christ, as Lord over heaven and earth, is already there. Christ brings his witnesses across frontiers into new areas of mission. They then witness to the reality of Christ as they find words, experiences, images, and metaphors in another language for the testimony of faith—we think of Paul’s address on the Areopagus. At the same time, they translate the gospel into practices that demonstrate the meaning of God’s love in Christ.8

> One of the terrifying conclusions of the much-reduced heretical gospel

(chapters one to three) that grips the church in the West, is that it has bequeathed to most evangelicals the concept that somehow we’ve got God in our back pocket. Many believe, either implicitly or explicitly, that somehow we transport him like a commodity, and we “take God” with us wherever we go. The assumption is that he just arrives on the scene when we get there and not before. We dialogue with people about God, assuming they have had no prior God experiences—theophanies, yearnings, religious experiences of the transcendent, and the like. We conclude they were entirely godless and unspiritual before we came along. As we have already seen, this is simply unbiblical; it cannot explain Paul’s approach to the Greek people in Athens, let alone our own personal stories of experiencing the good news (which imply God came and “found” us where we were too … lost without Christ, just like Linda in the strip club).

Isn’t God everywhere present? Surely by virtue of his immanence in all things, the creator God was/is always already present in every dimension of the universe. As redeemer God he is always wooing, forever courting, constantly wowing. God is relentless in his pursuit, by his Spirit; he’s always on the scene long before we get there with our tracts and our religious formulas. He has been there, waiting for us to become aware enough to show up, forever pointing us toward his Son in a gesture of appeal: “Hey, check out my magnificent Son! Isn’t he utterly amazing? Go to him!” The great Hans Urs von Balthasar goes as far as to talk about God actually “hunting” us down like prey: “When man seeks God, God is long before in search of man, and like the woman looking for her lost coin, God turns the house of man upside down. Man may hunt for God like one pursuing a deer with bloodhounds through fire and water, against lance and pike, but God’s hunt for man is even wilder.”9

## Finding God In A Thorny Shrub

In Exodus 3, after four decades of walking around the same few hundred acres of desert, tending sheep and raising a family, the life of Moses was forever changed on one particular day. While tending his sheep, he came upon a burning bush (“a thorny shrub” in Hebrew) that did not burn up. Dry plants make good tinder, and lightning strikes can quickly set them ablaze, so this may not have necessarily been an uncommon sight. What is unusual in this scene is the fact that the bush does not burn up. As God speaks to Moses out of this thorny bush and changes the course of the Hebrew narrative, we retrospectively realize this is a phenomenon generally called a “theophany,” a tug of the infinite, a visible manifestation of God. This theophany in particular includes a direct call from God to an incredibly important task. In Moses’ case, the call was: God’s people are in need of rescue.

To read this story well, a few questions must be wrestled with, especially in light of our quest to become aware of the prevenience of God: how long had the bush been burning before Moses was able to stop long enough to notice it? How long did he have to stare at it to realize it wasn’t going to burn up? And when God told him to take off his shoes for he was on holy ground, how long had the ground been holy? Along time? Had Moses just missed God calling him because he hadn’t been able to pay attention to what God had been doing all along? Rabbi Lawrence Kushner writes, Romancing the City 181 “The burning bush was not a miracle. It was a test. God wanted to find out whether or not Moses could pay attention to something for more than a few minutes. When Moses did, God spoke.”10 If Kushner is correct, we have to consider for ourselves—are we simply too busy and preoccupied to pay attention to the fact that we are standing on holy ground? (Not that we might be, but that we are.) Do our desires and longings lead us to fill our schedules to the brim, so much so that we fail to notice God speaking to us because we are just too busy “doing ministry”?

And how long exactly has he been calling and we haven’t noticed?

Can we learn the practice of paying attention and apply that rhythm to our lives?

> Day by day, year by year, your own story unfolds, your life’s story. Things
> happen. People come and go. The scene shifts. Time runs by, runs out.

Maybe it is all utterly meaningless. Maybe it is all unutterably meaningful.

If you want to know which, pay attention.

The unexpected sound of your name on somebody’s lips. The good dream.

The odd coincidence. The moment that brings tears to your eyes. The person who brings life to your life. Maybe even the smallest events hold the greatest dues. If it is God we are looking for, as I suspect we all of us are even if we don’t think of it that way and wouldn’t use such language on a bet, maybe the reason we haven’t found him is that we are not looking in the right places. Pay attention.11

## The Art of Listening

In addition to the practice of paying attention, if we are going to move toward a deeper anthropological understanding of a culture, we will need to learn to listen well. We must learn the rhythm of stopping, noticing the bush is burning, absolutely. But we must move beyond awareness and learn the art of listening.

Listening is one of the least practiced skills among the church (like a bad first date, we love to be the ones talking). And yet, if Jesus’ followers are serious about entering into a culture with a story of good news that will change the world, we should probably seek to understand exactly what good news is to those we are in relationship with. If only we will listen, they are telling us how to love them, how to bring the gospel to them. Or, as the inventor of the stethoscope, René Laennec, famously stated, “Listen, listen, listen to your patients, they are telling you the answer.” Mike Breen tells the story of certain English missionaries, well-supplied with money and resources, who travel to a slum in a small village in India, prepared to start a ministry, build a clinic, establish a new church, whatever this impoverished village needed. Fortunately, the missionaries were smart enough to adopt a posture of listening. The leaders of the village were very clear what good news was to their people: “What we really need is a PIN [zip] code, a post box, and a post office.” The missionaries responded with, “Yes, of course. We can do that, sure. But what about a ‘big ticket item’?

What can we build for you? What can we throw our money toward? Please tell us.” The response of the people was a simple: “No, really... what we’d like, what we need is a PIN code. In the poorest parts of our country, if you are considered a slum by the governmental system, and you don’t have a PIN code then you don’t exist on a map. There could be 20,000 people living in the village, but if you don’t have a PIN code, you don’t exist. Without a PIN code we’re not entitled to social services, any forms of structure, or health care. Without a PIN code you are invisible. If you are really here to help, and if you’re really listening to what we are saying, the whole world would open up to us if we could get a post box.” The missionaries listened. It took two years, but the place finally became registered as a neighborhood and this small village finally had a PIN code.

It happened, partially because the privileged missionaries were able to posture themselves to listen to their “patients,” rather than dictating the particulars of the good news for these villagers.12 Of course, multiple examples of how not to listen are happening every day, throughout the world; on busy city streets, men (it seems like it’s always men) stand upon their literal soapboxes and inform each and every person passing by about their impending journey to hell. These one-way proclamations have not one ounce of demonstration or dialogue about them. Most of you reading this book would never engage in, or endorse, these kinds of methods. Yet, if we were really honest, how different do Sunday morning worship gatherings appear to onlookers, as men (again, mostly men) stand on stages higher than a soapbox and speak/shout in similar ways? When will the art of listening (and dialogue) ever become a regular practice? What if we could make people feel like they’re not invisible anymore?

Romancing the City 183

## Listening to Everyone's Story

The recent book Church Refugees is a deep dive into some very important questions that highlight our inability to listen well. Authors Josh Packard and Ashleigh Hope wrote the book in an attempt to ask and answer two key questions: “Why is church so bad to some people? And more important sociologically, what happens to our society if this central institution continues to drive people away?”13 They entered into a culture and practiced the art of listening with the dechurched and the dones. The responses were many and varied, and while Packard and Hope acknowledge that each and every person’s story is unique, they also identify and list some common tensions that emerged from the stories they heard:

- They wanted community... and got judgment.
- They wanted to affect the life of the church... and got bureaucracy.
- They wanted conversation... and got doctrine.
- They wanted meaningful engagement with the world... and got

moral prescription.

> The authors go on to comment that,

[…] More than anything what the dechurched want is a home in the truest sense of the word. Aplace that’s safe and supportive and refreshing and challenging. An identifiable place, embedded in a larger community where they both know and are known by those around them and where they feel they can have a meaningful impact on the world. They long for the same kind of church that we all long for. They desire a church that’s active and engaged with the world, where people can bring their full and authentic selves and receive love and community in return.”14 Our purpose in this space is not to address the themes highlighted in Packard and Hope’s research but instead to draw attention to Church Refugees as a great example of people asking the right questions and learning the art of listening.

Ultimately, we need to learn to reverse the megaphone. Those on the Camino and at Burning Man view followers of Jesus as using funnelshaped megaphones to yell their message louder and louder. Instead, we need to learn to hold the small end of a megaphone up to our ear so that it acts as an amplifier for what people are saying to us, instead of what we’re saying to them. This would greatly assist us in this practice of listening.

## The Art of Interpathy

“Last night, for the first time in my life, I hugged a white man.” There is no denying this might appear to be somewhat of an odd phrase. Roy Taylor, my (Mark) now dear friend, spoke those words to me in a tiny church in Hollis, Queens, New York over twenty-five years ago. I was part of a group that had been working all week at Brother Roy’s church, helping with a variety of things, including holding what he referred to as “Revival Services” every evening. On one particular evening, I gave the message and when I had finished speaking, Brother Roy, all five foot, four inches of him, awkwardly hugged me as I stepped to my seat.

In my ignorance, I was completely unaware that this hug was such a significant and earth-shattering event. But it was to Brother Roy, and it should have been to me. His church consisted of about thirty people, all of whom had immigrated to the U.S. in the past twenty years or so. If I’d had any awareness of the weight of racial baggage that he and the other people in his church had carried for so long, I would have understood at least some of their pain. Not only did they live as people of different color amongst a white-dominated world, but they also experienced the travails of coming to live in this different land where they were rarely treated fairly or with dignity.

I really did not understand how they saw the world and how the world saw them. I did not understand the story they had lived. Not because I wasn’t there to see and understand, but because I never bothered to really look. In the current racial climate in the United States (Ferguson, MO; Charlottesville, VA; Black Lives Matter; and the ever-widening gap between law enforcement and the people), there is an even greater urgency to learn and understand a world so different to our own. But in this situation, twenty-five years ago, I had not done the necessary work. In my cluelessness, I failed to work diligently to understand this community’s societal narrative of oppression, racism, and utter brokenness.

Ours is a world that is still resistant to understanding and learning about any culture other than our own. This resistance can either be caused by defiance or simply naiveté, or sometimes a balance of the two. We do not love “the other” well because we do not know “the other.” Either by commission or omission we are guilty of not paying attention and not listening.

In Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize winning To Kill a Mockingbird, the protagonist and narrator, Scout Finch, is a young girl in southern Alabama who is forced to grow up quickly in the ever-changing world of the 1930s.

Aterm that missiologists use to describe this strong sense of affinity with a group of people, a cross-cultural form of empathy, is interpathy.

I nterpathy is a sense of feeling with the other, climbing into another’s skin and walking around in it. It describes that depth of relationship when an outsider to a particular community develops a burden in her heart for that group. It refers to the capacity for an outsider to pick up a community’s sense of values, what has hurt them, and where they’re headed as a people group. It’s a form of identification so deep that the guest/missionary almost becomes one of the tribe … an insider.16 The practice of interpathy is key when empathy crosses cultural boundaries.17 “In interpathic ‘feeling with,’ empathy is extended beyond known borders to offer a grace that draws no lines, refuses limits, claims universal humanness as sufficient foundation for joining another in a unique world of experience.”18 The practice of interpathy involves “bracketing” one’s own beliefs and values and temporarily entering a very different world of beliefs and values. This is a radical and serious attempt to engage across cultural boundaries. It seeks not only to recognize and respect another in their “otherness” but also to attempt to share that otherness in as much as one is able to. Such ability is required of the historian, anthropologist and translator.19 As anthropologists (learning to be cultural exegetes) and translators (of the good news of Jesus), are we able to practice interpathy?

The story is told of an encounter the French poet Jacque Prévert had with a beggar on the street. The man held a sign that said, “Blind Man without a home.” Prévert approached the man to learn if he was getting any donations. “Oh, no,” the man replied. “People pass by and drop nothing in my hat, the swines.” Rather than putting money in the man’s cup, Prévert took the sign from him and altered it. Afew days later, he came upon the beggar again and asked if things had changed. “Oh, yes. It’s wonderful.

My hat fills up three times a day.” Prévert had changed the phrase on the sign to say, “Spring is coming, but I won’t see it.” And now, when people came upon the blind man, they entered into a different story with him.

They were invited into the practice of interpathy. They put themselves in his place, crossed a boundary into his circumstance of life. By remembering their own springtime memories, they could understand the great tragedy this man was living.20 We believe it is possible that practicing interpathy changes not only how someone views the world but how they respond to it.

## It's All About How You Begin

Learning missional rhythms should always begin by first immersing ourselves in a given context, rather than presuming we know the answers.

In other words, we cannot frontload our mission with preformed ideas and models, assuming that what works in one context will readily apply in another. Different people groups experience the world differently. You need to listen in order to see. It is all about how you begin: if you begin with a theory, you begin with the answers, and the theory will always confirm what you (think you) already know. But begin with observation, and you begin with questions.

New StoryChurch in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago, led by Dory and Rich Gorman, suggest that in order to understand the people to whom you wish to bring good news, you have to go into a neighborhood and ask five questions related to the following issues:

- Power: Who are the powerful? Who are the powerless and why?

What has the Gospel got to say about that?

- Pennies: Who are the rich? Who are the poor? What does the Gospel

have to say about that?

- Pain: Where is the pain of the neighborhood? What does the Gospel

have to say about that?

- Parties: Where are the celebrations? How can we affirm and join in?
- Persons of Peace: Who are the gatekeepers of the community and

how can I serve them?21

Ultimately, all these examples and practices should lead us to a wi-l]der appreciation of God, his story, and his world. Adopting these rhythms will help us grasp what truly sounds like ravishingly good news for people in all spaces of life and faith … something that will make their hearts sing.

When we are able to discern what good news looks like in each context, we will find the key to an individual’s heart and by extension to the heart of their community.

British evangelist and missiologist Steve Hollinghurst writes: Cross-cultural evangelism is not about changing the cultural clothing of an explanation of Jesus’ death, but finding which parts of the whole story are “good news” within each culture and starting from these to explore the rest. To use the seed-planting analogy, the gospel is not a single seed that we plant in foreign soil; it is a whole packet of different seeds that together make a harmonious garden. Certain seeds in the packet will take root better in certain soils, others will need a lot of soil cultivation before planting, and others will be best planted much later when the rest of the garden is established. The art of the skillful missionary is to read the unknown soil and understand the seeds in the gospel packet well enough to know which ones to plant first, to discern when they have taken root in a healthy way, and know when it is time to plant the seeds that will be harder to nurture. 22 Sigmund Freud asserted that religion is “wishful thinking” that merely consoles us. If we reduce the good news to such an extent that Jesus simply serves as an illusion to relieve our anxieties around death, loneliness, and other such issues, then maybe Freud was right.23 Instead, may we give the gift of news that is greater than our wildest imaginations, news that means death doesn’t carry the same weight anymore and that the gospel is not just about where you go when you die, but about the chance you get to truly live right now.

When the author of the Gospel of Mark wrote, “The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1), the readers would have known the phrase good news or gospel or good tidings (all the same phrase) was a thoroughly Roman term. It was a phrase connected to pagan festivals and the cult of the emperor.24 The original hearers of Mark’s Gospel would therefore have immediately understood that Mark “was referring to good news that was a cause for a celebration, a historical event that would introduce a radically new situation to the world.”25 Likewise, any communication or incarnation of good news today should convey something that is a cause for celebration; an event that introduces a radically new situation to the world. The gospel we are to bring to a culture, a city, and a people that we have romanced and loved is a good news that is deeper and greater and wi-l]der than we could ever imagine.
