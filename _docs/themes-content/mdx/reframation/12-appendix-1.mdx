So what is discipleship and what is at stake when discipleship is not pursued as a core task of the church?

At core, discipleship is a Jesus-saturated affair: based squarely as it is on Jesus, discipleship involves the active modeling of my life on his (imitation of Christ) and the willingness to let him live his life in and through me (union or abiding in Christ). Discipleship is how Jesus gets into his church.

It has rightly been said that discipleship is who Jesus would be if he were you.2 Or perhaps it can be viewed as doing the same kind of things Jesus did for the same kind of reasons he did them. Discipleship is the means by which Jesus establishes a people and a community that is based on the ideal of human holiness, embodied and exemplified in Jesus. In other words, Jesus is not simply my Savior (and he is that), but he is also my Hero (someone I want to be like) and my Lord, whose life and words contain eternal life that can and must be accessed now.

Making disciples was clearly front and center to Jesus’ own approach to changing the world. Over time the church became the dominant religion and settled down to a more domesticated form. Correspondingly, the active focus on the following and imitation of Jesus has been incrementally substituted with believing certain tenets about Jesus. Objective, theologicalconfessional language has replaced the more immediate and subjective knowledge of Jesus that is gained by actively adhering to him. The net result is that the more human—and revolutionary—image of Jesus himself has been effectively decentered. The idea of Jesus has been reduced to that of eternal Savior, and is less and less example and Lord.

So much is this the case in some Protestant circles (particularly Lutheran and Calvinist) that many of its theologians assert that Jesus cannot be held as the ideal human image because it’s an impossible standard to follow, and any attempt to do so simply creates guilt. As a result, they have effectively abandoned the imitation of Christ as an ideal of the Christian life. In this view, the purpose of the Incarnation (let alone all the other dimensions of Christ’s person and work) has no meaning in its own right; it can only be seen as substantiating the work that Jesus accomplished on the cross. Jesus simply became one of us in order to save us on the cross, and the model of his humanity (and therefore his teachings) have limited authority for the Christian life.

This is exactly what Bonhoeffer condemns as “cheap grace”—a highly selective view of the work of Christ.3 In the diagram below, the reduction can be seen as elevating the cross (and perhaps resurrection) over all the other key dimensions of Christology. Using theological jargon, one might say that these interpreters have reduced Christology to soteriology. It’s yet another reduction and its heretical implications are easy to discern.

What is lost in this reduction related to the central person in the biblical story is phenomenal. Its impact on our understanding of Jesus and the gospel, as well as of discipleship and spirituality, is immeasurable. Because if Jesus is not put front and center in the cosmos and not just in the church (the Alpha and Omega), and if Jesus is not considered the archetypal human being (the Second Adam), then the theological system is broken where it matters the most. Without an active vision and following of Jesus, the gospel becomes another ideology. As a result, we have ended up with an attenuated, ideologically co-opted gospel that limits the work of Jesus to the private salvation of the soul but has little to say about anything beyond the narrow confines of the privatized individual.

And, even more dangerously perhaps, a church without discipleship always ends up with what Bonhoeffer calls a Christ-less Christianity, as the church in pre-war Germany amply demonstrated—and as does the culturally captive evangelical church in our day.

Discipleship means adherence to Christ, and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract Christology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge on the subject of grace or on the forgiveness of sins, render discipleship superfluous, and in fact they positively exclude any idea of discipleship Appendi x 1 195 whatever, and are essentially inimical to the whole conception of following Christ. With an abstract idea, it is possible to enter into a relation of formal knowledge, to become enthusiastic about it, and perhaps even to put it into practice but it can never be followed in personal obedience.

Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Christianity without discipleship, and Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ. It remains an abstract idea, a myth which has a place for the Fatherhood of God, but omits Christ as the living Son. And a Christianity of that kind is nothing more or less than the end of discipleship. In such a religion there is […] no following of Christ.4 This is a very dangerous reduction that inevitably leads to false and oppressive religion—as history sadly demonstrates.5 The point in this context is not to offer some definition of discipleship but rather to highlight what we lose when we fail to make discipleship central in the life of the church. The loss of the living and active presence of Christ among his people means the loss of the life that he came to bring to those who adhere to him (John 10:10).
