# Appendix 2

## BLINDED BY DISOBEDIENCE

Visitors to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at Langley, Virginia, are confronted with the following slogan: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32 KJV). Besides this being a rather blasphemous appropriation of the words of our Lord, this application nonetheless reflects the generally held view that any old truth, no matter what it is about, where it came from, or how one arrived at it, can set the subjective knower free. But this is not what Jesus is saying here. This type of thinking always circumvents the essentially biblical idea that religious truth almost always requires repentance and change.

Anything that involves theological truth—truths about God—requires something far more demanding and personal from the would-be knower.1 changes the frame entirely. Jesus actually says “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:31–32, italics ours). The freedom Jesus promised here is conditional on discipleship.

Similarly he says in John 7:17 that one must be predisposed to obey God if one is to discern truth (“Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own”). And in the parable of the wise and foolish builders, Jesus warns that “everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand” (Matthew 7:26).

James explicitly admonishes, “Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like” (James 1:22–24).

In other words, true knowledge of God can only be gained though a relationship with God and obedience to him. Or, as Calvin says, “All knowledge is born in obedience […] God cannot be truly served unless we obey his voice.”2 Without discipleship there can be no true (and liberating) knowledge of God. “Only he who believes is obedient, and only he who is obedient believes.”3 The Scriptures very clearly teach what we might call a bias toward obedient action. In other words, faith is not just about belief systems or dogmas and doctrines, as we have often made it. “The Word of God is telling us very clearly that if you do not do it, you, in fact, do not believe it and have not heard or understood it.”4 For instance, “When believers confess who Jesus is, they also and inevitably confess what they must become. Jesus is not an objective datum that, like a rock under a microscope, can be observed and examined in supposed neutrality. The statement ‘You are the Christ’ (Mark 8:29) imposes a claim on the one who says it. The Son of Man calls those who would know him to follow him” (italics ours).5 We cannot know Jesus without in principle first submitting to his claims over our lives and then following, and therefore learning to obey, him.

The intrinsic non-discipleship of our inherited forms of Christianity mean that we cannot truly interpret or understand the Scriptures— we have thus ended up with a severely reduced understanding of God’s Word. This is precisely what Bonhoeffer was dealing with in the culturally captive Christianity of pre-war Germany. They just didn’t understand the Scriptures and approached them as if they could distill abstract truth without orienting their lives to the living imperatives of God’s Word expressed through the medium of Scripture. The result is that many German Christians missed the meaning of their own lives and ended up participating in a dangerously diluted form of Christianized (Nazi-fied) religion that legitimized some of the most brutal and murderous actions in history. We suspect a similar dynamic is at work in large sectors of American Christianity at the moment—grace is a doctrine, not an experience of Jesus that changes everything.

The Bible is consistent throughout: obedience is a critical element for the faithful interpretation of God’s Word. In a whole chapter on the importance of obedience to the logic of the gospel and to discipleship, Dietrich Bonhoeffer notes that, “By eliminating simple obedience on principle, we drift into an unevangelical interpretation of the Bible. We take it for granted as we open the Bible that we have a key to its interpretation.”6 This sounds all too familiar—when we too open the Bible, we assume we know what it means even if we don’t act upon it. But this is a dangerous religious delusion.

Appendi x 2 199 Obedience unlocks the meaning of the Scripture and disobedience obscures and even distorts the intended meaning. This is what Scripture means when it calls us to hear—it means to listen with the view of obeying.7 Awould-be interpreter can only rightly understand theological truths by actually doing what the Scripture directs and commands. This means that mere intellectual engagement with the abstracted ideas and principles of Scripture can never produce an accurate understanding of God. “To deal with the word of Jesus otherwise than by doing it is to give him the lie […] The word we thought we had was not Christ’s, but a word we had wrested from him and made our own by reflecting on it instead of doing it.”8 By leaving the obedience of discipleship out of the equation of interpretation, we will never faithfully understand the Scriptures, nor can we gain true knowledge of God. This greatly contributes to the reduced life many now live. Adisobedient, non-discipling form of Christianity means we end up with that heretical, deistic, god-in-the-back-pocket-type religion that we have bemoaned throughout this book. In other words, discipleship is the right way for us to come to a knowledge of God. Conversely, nondiscipleship cannot deliver a true knowledge of God.
