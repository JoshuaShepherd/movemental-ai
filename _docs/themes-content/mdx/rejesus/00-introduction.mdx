# This Bit First

> Jesus is the center of all, the object of all, whoever does not know him, knows nothing aright, either of the world or of himself.
>
> —Blaise Pascal

> The means to know God is Christ, whom no one may know unless they follow after him with their life.

On the morning of June 7, 1964, the recently consecrated wing of the Ku Klux Klan known as the White Knights gathered solemnly in the Boykin Methodist Church in the pine woods near Raleigh, Mississippi. Concerned about the civil rights movement in Mississippi, the Klan had marshaled their forces to plan a so-called counterattack. Armed with shotguns and protected by men riding on horseback through the woods and fields, their Grand Chaplain ascended to the pulpit to read the following prayer:

> Oh God, our Heavenly Guide, as finite creatures of time and as dependent creatures of Thine, we acknowledge Thee as our sovereign Lord. Permit freedom forever. Give us the courage of our convictions that we may always stand for Thee and Thy righteousness. Help us to enjoy and build within us that kindred spirit which will keep us unified and strong in the Godly work. By the power of Thy infinite spirit and the energizing virtue of Thy love, bless us now in this assembly that we may honor Thee in all things, we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

The congregation said their amens softly under their breaths. Later, Sam Bowers, the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi, took to the pulpit and in overtly religious language declared what amounted to a holy war against the civil rights movement, justifying Klan attacks on the "nigger-communist invasion of Mississippi."2 Within the week, three civil rights workers were murdered in Neshoba County.

The overtly Christian character of the Ku Klux Klan, its symbolism, and its language, will not be news to anyone—who can forget those burning crosses? But the theological justification that continues to shock nearly half a century later. Praying in the name of Jesus to justify racial hatred jars, but there can be no denying that the KKK routinely called on Jesus to bless their work. Sam Bowers, is well known. Ken Dean, the director of the Council of Human Relations in Mississippi, said of Bowers that he, "in the most radical sense possible, is a believer in the sovereignty of God."3 Indeed, Bowers's faith was demonstrated in his raising of Jesus from the dead:

> There is one simple, and central, Empirical Fact, of manifested human history. That Empirical Fact, of course, is the Physical Resurrection of The Galilean... Miracle: The certainty of rational human knowledge is that the Resurrection happened.

Charles Marsh, who in researching the civil rights movement in Mississippi began a correspondence with Bowers later in life, says of him: "Bowers as theologian is, in a most radical, perplexing, and bizarre sense, a believer in the sovereignty of God."

How distressing, then, to those of us who likewise seek to trust in the "Christ-centered shape of all reality," that we share such a faith with so reprehensible a set of characters as Sam Bowers and the KKK. How did followers of Jesus like members of the Lutheran Church in Nazi Germany quote Jesus in support of the Holocaust? Or followers of the Crusaders or the Conquistadors or even the Rwandan death squads.
The KKK is, of course, an extreme example of a group adopting the image of Jesus in a way that seems foreign to us. But there are milder examples of groups that call themselves as Christians. In 2005, while en route to a speaking tour of the United States, Alan did what one does when in the eternal city, we visited the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica. It is hard to disagree that it is a truly remarkable feat of human ingenuity, with perfectly proportioned architecture on a massive scale designed to foster a feeling of spiritual awe. Like all tourists we wandered around the cathedral. Not looking where we were going, we accidentally bumped into a group of Japanese tourists. Standing in the heart of global Christianity for centuries, we reflected on what we were seeing. We agreed, the architecture of the basilica was stunning, and the sculpture, breathtaking. But one question bubbling around in our minds: Where is the poor, itinerant rabbi from Nazareth?

Similarly, on a recent speaking assignment in Moscow, Michael had the opportunity to wander through the Orthodox Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Constructed as recently as the 1990s, it is an astonishing feat of religious architecture. Situated on the banks of the Moskva River, a few blocks from the Kremlin, it replaced the original cathedral that had been destroyed by Stalin in 1931. It is constructed almost entirely of marble, and its gleaming golden domes or cupolas make it the tallest Orthodox church in the world. The white marble exterior is completely ringed by astonishing bronze relief statues of various saints and Christian heroes. Inside, the chapels are configured as an equal-sided cross measuring 85 meters wide, each replete with hundreds of gilt icons and frescoes. Wandering around the cavernous main chapel, which can hold up to ten thousand people, it is hard not to be amazed by the beauty of this house of worship. But if you look more closely, some disquieting features begin to emerge.

The original cathedral commemorated the so-called divine intercession that led to the Russian victory over Napoleon in 1812. In fact, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture debuted in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in 1882. When the cathedral was rebuilt in the 1990s, the architects tried to make it be as close a replica of the original as possible, including its deeply patriotic themes. The cathedral serves as both a worship space and a historical monument to the militaristic might of Russia. There are several chapels surrounding the main church are devoted to the history of Russia and the war against Napoleon, with frescoes commemorating the participants of that bloody war. The frescoes in the second-story gallery depict various saints and heroes of the Orthodox church or in Russian history. Below the new church is a large museum dedicated to the history of the cathedral and the Russian Orthodox Church, including a section on the new martyrs glorified as saints in 2000.

The face of Jesus therefore sits alongside an image of the incompetent Tsar Nicholas II, who oversaw the vicious Bloody Sunday massacre of unarmed protesters in 1905. As Michael left the cathedral and headed through the snow to the nearby Metro station he encountered an elderly woman kneeling on the frozen pavement, begging for loose change from disinterested passersby. While the cathedral's icons and frescoes were beautiful, it was hard to recall Jesus' words about what we do for the "least of these" being done to him. There was something more Christlike in the ragged image of the suppliant pauper outside the cathedral far more than in the opulent icons within.

We open this book with these three vastly different stories—the 1964 massacre in Neshoba County, and our visits to the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox cathedral—to illustrate our concern with what has been promoted in the name of Jesus. Throughout history, the name of Jesus has been invoked as central to movements that do not seem to reflect the descriptions of the KKK's Bible-thumping reign of terror in Mississippi seem far removed from the Jesus of the Gospels. In the Vatican, one of the archetypal buildings dedicated to the remembrance of Jesus, we found it hard to locate the revolutionary carpenter who is compellingly portrayed in the Gospels. At the Russian cathedral, Jesus competes with tsars and generals for the affections of the devoted. All of these are unsettling examples that raise disturbing questions about the continuity between Jesus and the subsequent Christian movement.

In saying this, we don't mean to equate the Catholic or Orthodox churches with the Ku Klux Klan. We simply mean to identify instances in which a group's depiction of the person of Jesus is incongruous to us. Indeed, the problem we found in Rome and Moscow is by no means limited to those churches or to that time. Throughout history, and including even the newer Christian church movements, have struggled with how to represent Jesus in their religious expressions.

These examples suggest questions that can be, indeed, should be, asked of all believers, churches, and denominations in any time and place:

- What ongoing role does Jesus the Messiah play in shaping the ethos and self-understanding of the movement that originated in his name?

- How is the Christian religion, if we could legitimately call it that, related to the person and work of Jesus?

- How do we assess the continuity required between the life and example of Jesus and the subsequent Christian movement?

- In how many ways do we domesticate the radical Revolutionary in order to make him more palatable to our cultural assumptions?

- And perhaps most important of all, how can a rediscovery of Jesus revitalize the mission of the church?

These questions get to the heart of what the church is all about. They take us to the defining center of the movement. We call this task refounding the church because it raises the issue of the church's foundation. There is no more important question for the church in our day than the question of refounding Christianity. It has become clear to us that no amount of tinkering with methods or strategies will solve the problem. No attempt to address Christianity's endemic and long-trended decline in the West will succeed unless we return to the foundation. No solution can be found that can stop the hemorrhage. There is no doubt that we must return to Jesus.

We must admit that both of us are somewhat obsessed with mission and what it means to be a missional people. But we both remain convinced that it is Christology (our understanding of the person, teachings, and impact of Jesus Christ) that remains even more foundational and therefore determines our ecclesiology (the forms and functions of the church).5 We have found no reason to revise our opinion on this, but over time we have only become more convinced of the truth of the matter.

## Follow Me—Becoming a Little Jesus

Following Jesus involves more than simply accepting him as your Savior via some prayer of commitment, no matter how sincere that prayer might be. In order to follow Jesus you must also emulate him, using his life as a pattern for your own. We call this emulation becoming a “little Jesus.” When we call ourselves little Jesuses, we aren’t claiming to be able to walk on water or die for the sins of the world. No, being a little Jesus means that we adopt the values embodied in Jesus’ life and teaching. Only Jesus was able to feed thousands with small amounts of bread and fish, but as little Jesuses we can embrace the values of hospitality and generosity. We might not be able to preach to the multitudes, but we can commit to speaking truth to lies. We can’t die for anyone’s sins, but we can embrace selflessness, sacrifice, and suffering.

We hope to see a conspiracy of little Jesuses unleashed all over the world, transforming their communities the way Jesus transformed his. To give concrete examples of what it means to emulate Jesus, throughout this book we will be giving thumbnail portraits of the little Jesuses who have inspired us.

Over the years (and apart) we have written books about a distinctly missional form of discipleship, but we are now convinced that this is only part of the matter. We are going back to the Founder and recalibrating the entire movement around him.

The core task of this book therefore will be to explore the connection between Jesus and discipleship. We want to assess the Christian movement in the light of the biblical revelation of Jesus and, indeed, recalibrate its mission, around the example and teaching of the radical Jesus. Is modern Christianity discontinuous with the way of Jesus? How consistent is our witness and spirituality with his? Can we really claim to be following Jesus without doing irreparable damage to the integrity of the faith?

Similarly, Jacques Ellul, the French theologian and philosopher, raises a disturbing historical problem for us to solve, a problem that he calls "the subversion of Christianity." He writes:

> The question that I want to sketch in this work is one that troubles me most deeply. As I now see it, it seems to be insoluble and assumes a serious character: How is it possible that the development of Christianity and the church has given birth to a society, a civilization, a culture that are completely opposite to what is indisputably the text of the law, the prophets, Jesus, and Paul? I say opposite and not just different, but on all points. On the one hand, Christianity has been accused of a whole series of crimes throughout history, crimes that are in complete contradiction to the biblical text and inspiration. On the other hand, revelation has been progressively marginalized and indeed neutralized by the church.... This is not just deviation but radical and essential contradiction.

And while this might seem to be an overstatement, Ellul proceeds to back up his conclusions with some unnerving scholarship. To our thinking, no one has yet answered his questions in a satisfactory way. Yet they cannot be ignored in the twenty-first century. Therefore, among other things, we have taken it upon ourselves to try to address the questions first posed by Ellul.

But this quest is not limited to the realm of scholarship and philosophy. For example, at a more popular level, Erwin McManus takes up a similar theme when he asks how it is possible that Christianity has been transformed from a dangerous and revolutionary spiritual force into a "religion" in the worst sense of the word—complete with all the trappings, cumbersome rituals, and dense theologies? Was this what Jesus intended for the movement he started? Was it his intention to create just another religion, with all the institutional trappings, cumbersome rituals, and dense theologies, along with all the other trappings that come with it? Is this what Jesus meant when he came pronouncing the arrival of the kingdom of God?

So what's this book all about? It's all about Jesus, with direct implications for our discipleship, some radical challenges for our churches, and some hopeful suggestions for re-Jesusing the church.

## It's All About Jesus

From the beginning, let us say that we believe that the only way we can truly authenticate ourselves as an expression of Christianity is to somehow measure ourselves against the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, our Lord.

And it is to him that we must now return if we are going to faithfully negotiate the profound challenges of the twenty-first century. But surely this is what the church tries to do in every age and context? Surely all expressions of Christianity seek to call Jesus Lord and have a special place reserved for him in their life and theology. We would argue that while confessionally this might be true, the church throughout history struggles to concretely conform its life to the radical life and teachings of Jesus. We don't say this judgmentally, as we are well aware how difficult it is to live a life based fully on Jesus. It is no easy thing, because the way that Jesus sets for us to follow is inherently subversive against all attempts to control, and thus institutionalize, the revelation that he so powerfully ushers in. In other words, it's just plain hard to create a religion out of the way of Jesus.

 Indeed, it’s not hard to find examples to support his view. Those who

want to find in Jesus merely a reformer of Judaism, or the last of the prophets, have characterized him as a revolutionary, while Tolstoy and his disciples saw him as a pacifist. To the enemies of the traditional social order, he was a warrior for justice. Edgar Ray Killen, who spent ten years in prison for his involvement in the deaths of the three civil rights workers in Neshoba County, spent much of his life studying the life of Christ and was never, in forty years of research, convinced that Jesus would have approved of the message preached from that pulpit in 1964.

Harnack believed that the only answer to the problem of losing the kernel of the gospel under the husks of foreign ideas was to emancipate the gospel from what he saw as the corrupting influence of Catholicism. And in this he was right. Setting Jesus free from Nazis, racist Afrikaners, and the KKK was necessary. But Harnack wasn't able to let Jesus be Jesus. As a leading Protestant liberal, he launched a quest to recover the historical Jesus, believing sincerely that if only the real Jesus could be recovered, he would be the inspiration for a renewed Christianity.

<!-- INCOMPLETE TEXT - REQUIRES SOURCE REVIEW: Sentence "But Harnack are often seen" appears to have grammatical error - likely missing "and others" or similar. Text "they limited their rediscovery of Jesus led him to one" appears fragmented. -->
But Harnack [MISSING TEXT - and others] are often seen as falling into the very trap in which they accused others. In their attempt to escape the rigors of the new science, history, they limited their rediscovery of Jesus [MISSING TEXT - led him to one] without such concepts as revelation, incarnation, miracle, and resurrection, which he considered unscientific. In the much-quoted judgment of the Catholic George Tyrrell, "The Christ that Harnack sees, looking back through nineteen centuries of Catholic darkness, is only the reflection of a liberal Protestant face, seen at the bottom of a deep well."11

## Suffering Prophet

Like Jesus announcing the Kingdom of God, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of a society without racism, oppression, and violence. His iconic "Have a Dream" speech, echoing Isaiah 40, "I have a dream that every valley will be exalted..." and Amos 5:24, "until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream," captured the imagination of a generation.

Martin Luther King Jr. faced extreme provocation with grace and dignity. He was influenced by the non-violent activism of Mahatma Gandhi in India, and deliberately embodied the explicit teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheek and to love one's enemies. King's message of justice and reconciliation, like Jesus' message gave hope to the poor of his day. As a little Jesus, King transformed society, and his legacy is honored among the twentieth-century martyrs from around the world who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey in London.

Surely the challenge for the church today is to be taken captive by the person of Jesus rather than by any agenda, no matter how noble they might be. We acknowledge that we can never truly claim to have fully captured Jesus, but it is inherent in the faith to keep trying and to never give up on this holy quest. We must allow ourselves to be caught up in his extraordinary mission for the world.

Too often, in churches, epitomized by the ostentatious excess of the Vatican, or the tawdry excesses of some forms of prosperity-gospel style Pentecostalism, the Christian movement has been subverted. Like a forest that has been overgrown with underbrush, the biblical Jesus is hard to find. But Jesus is still calling us to come and join him in a far more reckless and exciting adventure than that of mere church attendance. When we truly encounter Jesus, we find that he calls us away from hatred, violence, greed, excess, earthly power, or material wealth. Instead, following Jesus means not simply believing in belief, as in many expressions of evangelicalism. It means following him in the ways of knowing that bring about true spiritual transformation, which we will explore throughout this book.

 And so it is all about Jesus for us, with some direct implications for our
 lives as followers of Jesus.

### Direct Implications for Our Discipleship

Because this is a book about Jesus, it must also be a book that explores our living relationship with him. Therefore it should also be about discipleship—what it means to be part of his body, following in his way, becoming like him, and taking up his cause.

And so any attempt to reJesus the church must also recover a real sense of the radical and revolutionary nature of what it means to follow Jesus in the current Western context. To be free in Jesus must somehow mean that the idols of our time come under some serious questioning. For instance, to be free in Jesus surely will mean liberation from the shackles of a predominant and omnipresent middle-class consumerism that weighs heavily on us. To be free in Jesus means allowing Jesus to be Jesus, and in doing so, allowing Jesus to challenge our religiosity or our self-righteousness or our greed or worse.

### Radical Challenges for Our Churches

Following Jesus will also have implications for a religion constrained by degenerating institutional forms and expressions. And so this is also a book about ecclesiology (the understanding and practice of church). We will explore the implications of the love and mission of Jesus for the church in what promises to be the most missionally challenging century ever. And given that we are convinced that Christology must be the foundation for any authentic understanding of church, we believe that if we don't deal with Christology, how can we ever get ecclesiology right? How many so-called new movements has the Protestant church seen in recent decades? The seeker-sensitive movement, the charismatic movement, the parachurch movement, rapid church multiplication movements—many of them have been presented as new ways of doing church. From our perspective, we need to return to Jesus and then dare to place all our deeply held desires for how to do church at its feet.

Are we fundamentally aligned with Jesus' purposes and will for his community on earth? It's a good question, and one we must ask at this critical time in history. When we direct that question to our founder, we find the answer is to compare the 'religion' of Jesus with the religion of Christianity. If we take him as the prototypal Christian, and if, apart from the uniquely messianic and salvific aspects of his work, his life and teachings are normative and authoritative for all of his followers everywhere, then we are left no option but to measure ourselves against him. We believe such a comparison will reveal the church to be on the wrong side of history in many ways. Any form of spirituality can hardly be considered to be civil. It must be called what it is: a radical challenge to the status quo. Jesus undermines any status quo that is not built on the all-encompassing love of God, and this has implications for our religious codes, institutions, and behavior.

### Some Suggested Reformulations of Our Spirituality

And because this is a book about Jesus, it is also therefore a book exploring the nature of Christian spirituality and worship in our context. If Jesus is our center point, our guide, and the mediator between humanity and God, then he must also be the center of our spirituality.
It is true that Jesus is like God, but the greater truth, one closer to the revelation of God that Jesus ushers in, is that God is like Christ. As Michael Ramsey put it, "God is Christlike, and in him is no un-Christlikeness at all."12 Or in the words of Jesus, "If you have seen me, you have seen the Father" (John 14:9). This has massive implications for us, especially for our understanding of God, but also for our understanding of ourselves. Not only does Jesus redefine our concept of God but also he shows us the perfect example of what a true human being should be like. Therefore, focusing our discipleship on Jesus means becoming like him. It sets the agenda for our spirituality. It acknowledges that Jesus is the pattern for our life. He is the standard by which we measure ourselves, the quality of our relationships, and the direction of our mission.

If the heart of Christian spirituality is to increasingly become like our founder, then an authentic comprehension of Jesus becomes critical. All too often the focal point of our corporate and individual life shifts from its true center. But any authentic Christian expression models itself on Jesus, and it is God's unambiguous aim to conform us "to the likeness of his Son" (Rom 8:29). In The Forgotten Ways, Alan explored how this Christ-centered spirituality is essential to God's plan and purposes for his world.

If this worries us, if we think this would somehow upset the finely balanced ecology of our spirituality, then we can perhaps reframe the issue by asking: How bad can we become if we became more like God—how bad can we become if we became more like him? Would the world be a better or worse place if we all became more like Jesus? The answer is obvious, and therefore as a matter of fundamental importance to our humanity, our spirituality, and our mission, Jesus must be the center point and the defining center of our faith.

Finally, in doing this we hope that we can in some way restore Christology to the church at large, to make it applicable to the whole people of God. For far too long Christology has been the province of academic and professional Christians, who seem far more concerned with an examination of how the divine and human are related in Jesus' person than they are in the details of his life or the content of his teaching and vision. As theologians attempted to use speculative philosophy and ontology to explore the two natures of Christ, Christology became something of a complex science that in effect excludes the theologically uninitiated person. When the study of the remarkable life and teachings of Jesus becomes the sole province of theologians and removed from the everyday concerns and from the missional context of the church, it will tend to degrade into abstract speculation. When the attempt to probe the nature of Christ reaches Gnostic proportions and takes years of study to even begin to understand, something has gone terribly wrong.

 any loss of a direct, grassroots comprehension of Jesus must be a major cause

 Therefore, we propose a rediscovery of Christology that includes a preoccupation with the example and teaching of Jesus for the purposes of emulation by his followers. Some will say that such emulation is arduous to achieve
 death and resurrection, the miracles, and his judgment of the unrighteous.

Surely, they argue, we cannot die for the sins of others or judge their deeds.

And here’s where we need a far richer Christology than we’ve been offered in the past. For us, Christology is the study and examination of the entire phenomenon of Jesus, including his person and work and teachings, for the purpose of determining in what ways the various elements of his life and activity can be emulated by sinful human beings. For example, we can’t die for others, as Jesus did, but we can offer ourselves sacrificially in service of others. Paul compares husbands loving their wives with Jesus dying for our sins.

Aworking Christology would help us understand Jesus better and provide the tools for appropriating his example into our lives.

 So this is not primarily a book about renewal for its own sake, nor is it
 a book about Christology as a strictly theological discipline. Rather, it is an
 attempt to reinstate the central role of Jesus in the ongoing spiritual life of
