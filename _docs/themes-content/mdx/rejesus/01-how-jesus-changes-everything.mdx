# How Jesus Changes Everything

> "Jesus is Lord" is a radical claim, one that is ultimately rooted in questions of allegiance, of ultimate authority, and of the nature of power. Instead, Christianity has often sought to ally itself comfortably with allegiance to other authorities, be they political, economic, cultural, or ethnic.
>
> —Lee Camp

> In the same way the Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became man for no other purpose. It is even doubtful, you know, whether the whole universe was created for any other purpose. It says in the Bible that the whole universe was made for Christ and that Christ is God, and that God is love.
>
> —C. S. Lewis

Key to encountering the biblical Jesus is a step that many Christians seem to find painful, that is, our preparedness to read the Gospels in order to emulate Jesus. It appears that a good church upbringing will do many marvelous things for you, but one of the unfortunate things it also does is convince you that you don't need to actually follow Jesus. In Exiles, Michael argued that the traditional Christian depiction of the porcelain-skinned, gentle Jesus has domesticated him.1 We readily acknowledge that none of us have within us the fortitude, the strength, or the holiness to fully emulate Jesus. It's a lost cause. But it's a lost cause made worth it by the forgiveness and grace shown to us in Christ. Just because Jesus forgives us for our sinfulness, he doesn't nullify the call to good works and godly living.

Rather, he elevates us from an endless and hopeless attempt to impress God to a joyful adventure of enjoying Christ's presence by imitating him. The quest to emulate Jesus isn't folly. When it's embraced by those who know they are forgiven for all the ways they will fall short, it is a daring exploit!

Making this very point, M. Scott Peck in Further Along the Road Less Traveled recounted the episode when Baptist theologian Harvey Cox was addressing a convention of Christian healers—pastors, therapists, nurses, doctors—on the story from Luke 8 of Jesus raising Jairus's daughter from the dead. In the well-known story, as Jesus is on his way to heal the dying girl, a woman who has been hemorrhaging for years breaks from the crowd and touches his garment. Jesus stops and demands to know who touched him. The cowering woman sheepishly admits it was her. Jesus, moved with compassion for her years of unspeakable suffering, heals her and continues on his way to the house where he raises the child back to life.
 Having related the story (no doubt in greater detail than we just did),

 Cox asked his audience of six hundred Christian healers and therapists to inThe bleeding woman? The anxious father? The curious crowd? Or Jesus? What Cox found was that around a hundred felt they could relate to the desperate woman; several hundred identified with Jairus, whose daughter was dying; the majority identified with the perplexed group standing by. And six—yes, six—people felt they could identify with Jesus.

 Peck’s point in recounting this experience was to point out that there is
 something seriously wrong with Christianity when only one in every hundred
 Christians can identify with Jesus. Here was a story about Jesus the healer,
 divine, so otherworldly, that we cannot connect with him anymore? Peck sugJesus because we perceive ourselves way down here and Jesus way up there,

We’re supposed to identify with Jesus, act like Jesus, be like Jesus. That is what Christianity is supposed to be about: the imitation of Christ.”2

 By making Christ seem otherworldly, even ethereal, the church has inadvertently put him out of reach to us as an example or a guide. Even though
 Jesus routinely called people to follow him, the church has often represented

 The process of re Jesusing the church will begin with a rediscovery of

 the fierce and outrageous life of Jesus. Too many people have become turned

It reminds us of the quip made by the archbishop who is reported to have said, “Everywhere Jesus went there was a riot. Everywhere I go they make me cups of tea!”

 This was the experience of punk rocker, screenwriter, and novelist Nick
 Cave. Writing in an Introduction to Mark’s gospel, Cave talks about how as a
 younger man he found the Jesus presented to him in church as anemic and
 tually all his attention on the Old Testament, drawn as he was to its violence

Later, an Anglican vicar in London suggested he read Mark instead, and Cave was astonished by the Jesus he discovered between its pages:

 The Christ that the church offers us, the bloodless, placid “Savior”—the man
 cross—denies Christ his potent, creative sorrow or his boiling anger that conoffering up a figure that we can perhaps “praise,” but never relate to.5
 Cave’s Introduction to Mark is beautifully written and deeply heartfelt.

He writes about “that part of me that railed and hissed and spat at the world” initially taking pleasure in the “wonderful, terriblebook,” the Old Testament, before mellowing out in later life. “You no longer find comfort watching a whacked-out God tormenting a wretched humanity as you learn to forgive yourself and the world,” he says somewhat unfairly of the Old Testament.

Nonetheless, after all those blood-curdling stories he was well and truly ready to meet Jesus. And meet him he did, seeing Jesus in Mark with a fresh perspective many seasoned Christians often miss:

 The essential humanness of Mark’s Christ provides us with a blueprint for our

 mans were for ever held to the ground by the pull of gravity—our ordinariness,
 the freedom to rise and to fly. In short, to be Christ-like.6
 Cave is no theologian and doesn’t pretend to be, but he’s on to something. Look at what happens to those Jesus encounters in the Gospels—the
 Thomas—they are lifted up by him, transformed, strengthened, renewed.

Jesus teaches them how to live, not just how to worship. Today, we need to accept Jesus as our guide, as well as our Savior. And only a Savior as human as the one portrayed in the Gospels could ever be our guide.

 Long before Cave was writing this, another novelist was exploring the
 essential humanity of Jesus. The prodigious talent of Dorothy L. Sayers found in
 the story of Christ more than enough material to occupy her attention. Sayers,
 tive novels, set between the wars and featuring English aristocrat and amateur
 magisterial translation of Dante’s Divine Comedy, Christians seem to know her

 to satisfy her. She needed to encounter the real Jesus. The “bloodless, placid
 Savior” that Nick Cave rebelled against repelled her every bit as much. In the

 While people like C. S. Lewis, who read The Man Born to Be King every

 Jesus to be vulgar and unbecoming. Sayers’s response to one caller, who teleShould Come, summed up her approach:

Sayers’s argument was that while the world saw a church that preferred a sanitized Savior, they had no choice but to conclude that the stories about him were myths and legends, not references to the historical incarnation of God in humankind. And while the central Christian story was merely a myth, it never laid any claim on the lives of believers or unbelievers alike. Like Robin Hood or the Knights of the Round Table, the Gospels might have taught a moral ethical code, but they didn’t introduce us to this man, this person, who demanded to be the guide of my life. This Sayers called the “scandal of particularity,” and it remains a scandal to this day.

 But where is the scandalous Jesus in our churches today? Where is the
 Jesus who taunted the religious elite (Luke 20:32–36), who teased a Canaanite
 woman (Matt 15:21–28), who evaded arrest (John 7:32–36), who commended

 Those taken captive by the sight of Christ must be prepared for a reintegration of the theological concepts of missio Dei, participatio Christi, and imago

 When our imaginations are taken captive by Jesus, we will see God differently. Rather than seeing God as a loving but distant Father who calls us

Naturally, the Pharisees are outraged, not only because he is apparently disregarding the Sabbath but because he is equating himself with Yahweh’s missional work. But Jesus presses on, making an even more provocative claim: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise” (John 5:19).

 Nothing could be more scandalous! Effectively, Jesus is claiming to be
 captive to the missio Dei, attending only to his Father’s missional activity, irrespective of narrow interpretations of Hebrew law. This stunning claim, that he
 entirely at the impulse of the sent and sending Father, is a challenge to us. If

 The instance of Jesus’ physical death is depicted as a moment of great

 has shifted in the spiritual realm. Acosmic tsunami has been unleashed.

Through Jesus’ death God has entered into our world for good. God will now no longer dwell in temples, but in the hearts of those who serve God.

 This is picked up again by Paul, when he refers to the church as the body
 of Christ. The triune God doesn’t reside in a temple or any other building.

Rather, the physical embodiment of the Trinity is in the people of God, the followers of Christ. The missio Dei describes the impulse that saw the Father send his Son into the world to enflesh him. It is also the impulse that sees the Father, the Son, and Spirit send us into the world as his ambassadors, his representatives, enfleshing him here on earth. This leads us to our second aspect of being shaped by Jesus.

 As we said earlier, God’s mission in this world is his and his alone. The

 glory of God, not the church, is the ultimate goal of mission. Our role as the
 dom of God. We neither determine our own agenda nor merely imitate his
 guidance. Again, Bosch addresses this superbly:
 Mission takes place where the church, in its total involvement with the world,
 bears its testimony in the form of a servant, with reference to unbelief, exhealing, liberation, reconciliation and righteousness... Looked at from this

But it would be helpful to recall in what ways the term ecclesia was employed by Paul’s non-Christian contemporaries in order to get closer to the original raw material Paul uses in developing his unique ecclesiology.

There’s more to Paul’s idea of the church than just a gathering. But isn’t it interesting that the base, raw material he uses to develop his vision for us is that of a group of elders adding value to the village, bringing wisdom, and connecting our destiny with that of the community? We think that to be the sent people of God implies that we will have our neighborhood’s best interests at heart. We think Christians should see themselves as sent by Jesus into the villages of which they’re part, to add value, to bring wisdom, to foster a better village. In short, to participate with the work of Christ all around us.

 The vision Jesus brings is one where the believer learns to identify and

Romans, Canaanites, thieves, adulteresses (John 8), and Samaritans (John 4) were seen by the Jewish establishment as being on a par with dogs. As we mentioned, animals are not seen in Scripture as bearing the image of God, so to disregard the imago Dei in certain peoples is to treat them like animals.

You never see Jesus doing that. Lepers, prostitutes, tax collectors, children, demoniacs—they were treated with great grace and respect by him. Even the hemorrhaging woman whose issue of blood made her perennially unclean is paraded by Jesus before the ogling crowd, her faith acknowledged by the Savior of the world for all to see. This was the scandalous Jesus at his most untamed.

 If we re Jesus the church, we will lead it toward a greater respect for the
 unbeliever, a greater grace for those who, though they don’t attend church
 services, are nonetheless marked by God’s image. It will lead to a greater

 Father Vaillant’s testimony is anchored in a belief in the imago Dei. The
 buried church supplies are symbolic of the image of God buried deep in the
 souls of all people. The missionary task is not to bring God to them but to

 this treasure and “restore to God his own.”

Inspired by a tattooed man he saw at a county fair when he was fourteen, OE has spent more than a decade covering the front of his body with a variety of images, trying to emulate what he remembered as the symphony of colorful images on that tattooed man. And yet with each new tattoo, his dissatisfaction grows.

Whereas his hero’s pictures looked harmonized and integrated, OE saw his own designs as haphazard and messy. In OE Parker, O’Connor has created the typical human, striving for redemption and yearning to be something beautiful. And yet each new attempt to correct the overall effect of his tattoos leads to even greater disappointment.

 When we meet Parker, he has married the daughter of a fundamentalist
 preacher, a dour young woman named Sarah Ruth who would only marry him
 in the county clerk’s office because she believed church buildings to be idolafoil for her heathen husband’s search for redemption. She represents that
 in fairytale form, not straight from the Gospels. She has rules for everything,
 and every person.
 Sarah Ruth, as one might imagine, despises Parker’s tattoos. But more

 than that, she seems displeased with everything he does. In voicing her dispointment with himself. He desires more than anything to do just one thing
 in his focus on pleasing the unpleasable Sarah Ruth. For a man who has only
 not surprising that in his simplistic way, he decides that the only thing he

 He visualized having a tattoo put there that Sarah Ruth would not be
 able to resist—a religious subject. He thought of an open book with HOLY
 BIBLE tattooed under it and an actual verse printed on the page. This seemed
 Bible? What you think I want to read the same verse over and over for when
 Brow-beaten and anxious about choosing wrongly, he ends up in
 a tattooist’s parlor leafing through a catalogue of religious images before
 being stopped by the piercing gaze of a Byzantine icon of the face of Christ.

O’Connor describes how Parker felt he “were being brought back to life by a subtle power” as the image of Jesus takes hold of him. He decides there and then that the most pleasing thing he could do was to have his whole back tattooed with this face of Christ. The symbolism of “Parker’s Back” isn’t restrained. O’Connor is obviously depicting a man being marked by Jesus, inscribed with the express image of God. Albeit in a secular way, she is nonetheless describing Parker’s baptism, his initiation into the family of Jesus. As surely as any catechumen is being marked by Jesus at baptism, OE Parker is equally denoted as belonging to him. Where none of the other of his slapdash collection of tattoos can satisfy him, his whole back now bears the unified, single image of God.

 But as you might expect, not even this painful act of sacrifice can win
 Sarah Ruth’s approval. When he returns home and reveals the Byzantine
 Christ across his back, she is initially confused. “It ain’t nobody I know,” she
 nize the face of Jesus, while the recalcitrant heathen is stained by it forever.
 “It’s him,” Parker said.

 “Him who?”
 “God!” Parker cried.

 “God? God don’t look like that!”
 “What do you know how he looks?” Parker moaned. “You ain’t seen him.”

 “He don’t look,” Sarah Ruth said. “He’s spirit. No man shall see his face...
 "Idolatry," Sarah Ruth screamed. "Idolatry... I don't want no idolater in this
 house!” And she grabbed up the broom and began to thrash him across the
 shoulders with it... and large welts... formed on the face of the tattooed
 Christ. Then he staggered and made for the door...18

Sarah Ruth can neither understand nor appreciate the incarnation. For her, God is a spirit, and no one can see his face. The idea that God has taken on human flesh and walked among us is beyond her comprehension and her spirituality. She prefers her Deity far beyond and distant. It is even less likely that she could comprehend the idea that her husband has chosen to incarnate God in his own body. The welts she leaves across the tattooed Jesus’ face mirror the beatings that the real Jesus bore in his passion. The story ends most poignantly. Still gripping the broom and filled with rage, Sarah Ruth looks out toward a pecan tree in her yard: “her eyes hardened still more.

There he was—who called himself Obadiah Elihue—leaning against the tree, crying like a baby.”19

 In this, the closing line of the story, O’Connor reminds us of Parker’s
 full name. Obadiah, “servant of the Lord,” Elihue, “God is he.” Hanging on
 a tree, beaten by one who doesn’t recognize his identity, bearing the hatred
 of the incarnation. He is the suffering servant, the crucified one, and perhaps
 calling at birth to be marked by God.
 We confess that this calling is ours as well. Like Father Vaillant in Death

 Comes for the Archbishop and OE Parker, we too feel marked by Jesus and, as a
 missio Dei, the church as the participati Christi, and the world as the imago Dei.

And we echo Father Vaillant when he says, “I confess I am covetous of that mission. I desire to be the man who restores these lost children to God. It will be the greatest happiness of my life.”
