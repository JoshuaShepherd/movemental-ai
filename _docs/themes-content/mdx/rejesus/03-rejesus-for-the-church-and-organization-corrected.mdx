# ReJesus for the Church and Organization

> Christ's whole life in all its aspects must supply the norm for the life of the following Christian and thus for the life of the whole Church.
>
> —Søren Kierkegaard

All religious institutional embeddedness—whether in the form of temple worship, unjust social systems, or repressive religious practices—is challenged by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

In Revelation 3:20, we hear these famous words of Jesus: "Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me." We generally interpret this to mean that Jesus is standing at the door of our hearts asking to come in. Even though we can appreciate the sentiment, the verse itself in Revelation 3 is that in Laodicea, the famously lukewarm church that Jesus is addressing, he is standing on the outside of the church asking to come in. The question that should spring to our minds is, "How can Jesus be outside the church? Shouldn't he be the Lord of that very church?" But of course, John's revelation of the seven churches shows that many of them were making the same errors. Jesus is outside the door of the church in Laodicea! How is it possible that Jesus could be outside the church? The question we ask in introducing this chapter must be, is Jesus really at the center of our churches, or has he been pushed to the margins by the leadership of the insiders? And what has been the result?

## ReJesusing Our Organizations

As is now clear, our basic assumption is that Jesus provides the primary template for us as individual followers but also for the church as the community that is in Christ and that walks in his way. As stated earlier, we need to constantly recalibrate, to test whether we are indeed in the faith. The inference is that by degrees we have lost touch with the wild and dangerous message that it carries and have domesticated it. A Christlike life, and no matter how we configure it, that must surely mean that we are aligning ourselves with the life, teachings, and mission of Jesus. The degree that we are living in alignment with Jesus is the degree to which we can call ourselves authentic disciples.

This might well sound like idealism to some more pragmatically inclined readers, and perhaps rightly. They may well point out the fact that as Christianity has grown, it has become a massive global movement comprising thousands of organizations with massive capital and resources.

And there is no denying that such organizations do manage to help many people and bring many to faith. Therefore, they might consider it an indulgence on our part to be prattling on about the radical life of Jesus when, whether we like it or not, we are now obligated to maintain those religious organizations with their associated programs, paid professionals, ideologies, capital, buildings, and so on. Theirs is a call to pragmatism over radicalism, although, we suspect, in more honest moments many of them would probably admit that much that we do seems to have only an indirect correlation to the uncluttered, nonreligious, life-oriented faith so compellingly portrayed in the Gospels. These objectors might, in spite of their deepest spiritual intuitions, simply say that we have no choice but to continue to operate the services and maintain the system or else the whole edifice might crumble.

And others still might add the fact that along with the institution of the church we have long and complex histories that have shaped us, carried us, and landed us where we are today. They would suggest that we are indeed the continuation of the early Christian movement even though it is not really the same phenomenon. Indeed they won't, and indeed they can't, go back to some simple, somewhat naïve, aesthetically pleasing form of primitive Christianity. They no doubt believe that for good or ill, Christianity now exists, embedded, in its institutional forms and that the idealism of a re Jesus project has no place in the sensible Christian life.

And we must admit that there is substance to both these responses—the pragmatic and the traditionalist. The institution of the church (traditional and contemporary) is not without God, beauty, or blessing. And we recognize this. We don't wish to suggest that it is worthless (and please forgive us if we have given that impression). But we must ask, "Is this really what Jesus intended for his movement?" And isn't all this paraphernalia a far cry from what we seek and long for? Does advancing in the kingdom of God boil down to this?

Running programs and services and/or guiding the laity through liturgical complexities in order to help people get to the God they are all meant to access directly through Jesus anyhow? Was this what Jesus had in mind when he established the church (Matt 16:18–19)?[^1] And, whatever happened to the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers that many within the Protestant movements are meant to adhere to (1 Pet 2:9)?

We are not insensitive to the fact that a great many people feel connected to Jesus via the stained-glass imagination of grand ecclesiastical traditions. Nor do we dispute that contemporary-style seeker churches have brought many people to faith. It would be ignorant of us to do so. God is everywhere, and his grace is everywhere.

However, whatever case can be made for the status quo, none of us can, or should, avoid the spiritual test of evaluating the validity of our preferred expression of church by cues offered by Jesus the Messiah. Unless we can demonstrate that our expression of church is aligned with the template that Jesus laid down in his life and work, then what in God's name are we doing? Whatever we are doing is built squarely on the rock of Jesus and takes its direct agenda (and its agenda must be direct) from his life, his teaching, his critique of religion, his commitment to the way of the kingdom, and his mission.

## Evangelistic Activism

Alan Walker was a Methodist minister who devoted his life to both social activism and evangelism. In the 1950s and 1960s, he traveled throughout Australia and New Zealand, in which he preached to more than half the population. Such evangelistic tours were relatively common in Australia at the time; by the early twentieth century, evangelists like Billy Sunday and others made regular visits to the country to conduct similar evangelism circuits.

Alan Walker pioneered the integration of evangelism and social activism in a day when the Protestant church generally saw the two realms as incompatible. He also had the moral courage to speak out against apartheid when many churches had been largely silent on the issue. As a pacifist during World War II, and the Vietnam War, he was a vocal critic of war. In 1958, he took over the leadership of the Methodist Central Mission in Sydney, Australia and transformed it into a missional community. He was banned from South Africa for his anti-apartheid stance and was knighted by the Queen of England, befriended by prime ministers, and became one of the most respected religious leaders of Australia. Alan Walker embodies Jesus because his social activism was never at the expense of his evangelistic passion, and his evangelism was never at the expense of social justice.

For renewal (organizational, communal, and personal) we need to rediscover Jesus and allow him to question so much of what we might build our various religious houses on. At the very least, we need to discover the original genius of the Christian experience and to allow it to strip away all that is not essential.

It has surprised us that in recent years even our secular culture has been asking similar questions. Filmmakers (secular prophets of our time?) have recently depicted Christlike characters in their movies. Those who have missed these films as savage attacks on Christ have missed the point. Films such as *Jesus of Montreal*, *Chocolat*, and *As It Is in Heaven* are not attacks on Jesus.

They are scathing critiques of institutional Christianity, but they all portray their messianic-like protagonists with great sympathy, even reverence.

The most allegorical of them, the Canadian film *Jesus of Montreal*, depicts an out-of-work actor, Daniel, who is commissioned to breathe new life into a church passion play but who enrages the religious authorities when he stages a production that is too real, too raw, too authentic (tellingly, under the gaze of a stone statue of Christ outside the church), Daniel gathers around him a troupe of misfits and outcasts—a man who dubs porno films, an overlooked actress, and others rejected by mainstream agents. Like Jesus, Daniel molds this band into a proud, functional community. The passion play is soon the talk of Montreal, with hundreds of non-churchgoers lining up to see it. But the religious leaders, who are so outraged by his earthy, passionate portrayal of Jesus, shut it down.

*Jesus of Montreal* is more than a drama about an actor who becomes consumed by his role. It is an allegory in which Daniel is essentially a Christ figure right from the opening John-the-Baptist parallel scene. And while it offers us no easy answers, it does suggest that we cannot do anything else. But if we're wise, we'll listen to the film's basic premise: if we want to rediscover the power of the Christian message, we need to rediscover Jesus.

Likewise, in two other films, Christ figures turn up in small communities, offering hope to the marginalized but ending up in conflict with the church establishment. In *Chocolat*, a woman called Vianne transforms a dour French village, much to the chagrin of the mayor, who is the overbearing power behind the meek priest. In *As It Is in Heaven*, a famous conductor returns to the Swedish town of his childhood and is inveigled into directing the local Lutheran church choir. He transforms the singers into a world-standard choir, but in so doing he finds that the Lutheran establishment cannot tolerate his methods. He leaves behind a group of men and women who will never be the same.

We don't suggest that we should take our cue from filmmakers, but these movies have intuited something important and are popular precisely because they speak to a deep hunger. Even though these are decidedly nondivine Christ figures, they do speak to an audience that believes that a small group of people, inspired by an extraordinary visionary, can change its worlds. These films suggest that running a wealthy religious institution is not the same as following Jesus. These films, and many more besides, suggest that a small group of people, inspired by an extraordinary visionary, can change its worlds. Daniel's acting troupe transforms the lives of those who encounter their passion play. Vianne's friends from the chocolate shop initiate a revolution that eventually transforms the entire village. In *As It Is in Heaven*, the conductor, also called Daniel, dies of a heart attack listening to his choir achieve a sense of harmony rarely accomplished by even the best choirs.

The message these films seem to be making was also expressed by anthropologist Margaret Mead, when she wrote, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."[^2] How different is this from the revolution forged by Jesus and his small band of followers? And how different is this from the missional movements and how they center on Jesus:

> The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its element is a very simple thing. It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great numbers of people. It needs nothing for the propagation of the gospel except the gospel itself and the Spirit of God, and that of a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the things of this world, but a man filled with the Holy Spirit, a man with faith which uniting a man to Christ, sets him on fire.[^3]

We feel that at this critical juncture of history, when the church is forced to find itself again by the sheer circumstance of the adaptive challenge of the twenty-first century, we need to rediscover the passionate community of Christ, filled with the love of God that so imbued our founder.

This process of going back to our generative center will mean a process of rediscovering Jesus afresh. We need to re Jesus our organizations.

## Christianity Minus Christ Equals Religion

In order to get to the nub of the problem, let's reverse the way of looking at the process of re Jesus: let us think about what happens when you take Christ out of Christianity. Consider this equation:

**Christianity - Christ = Religion**

It makes sense, doesn't it? Some statements have an immediate ring of truth about them, and for many Christians this is one of them. Of course, Christianity without the lifeblood, the vision, the love of the real Jesus is a dead thing. We are using the word "religion" in rather negative sense—as a set of inherited rituals, beliefs, and practices that tends to be quite oppressive and controlling. And this is how we mean it here.

The removal of Jesus from the faith does result in the rise of religious consciousness and institutional expression. A study in European church history will more than adequately prove this point. The Inquisition was not a freak of history but rather was the logical result of a highly coercive and controlling religion that had lost sight of its reason for existence—had lost contact with its founder. But how does this happen? How does a movement as vital as that of early Christianity find itself having drifted so far from its foundation? This is not so mysterious a matter. In fact, it can be readily explained by the sociology of religion. Sociologists recognize that the fading of the initial founding impulse of a movement is not unique to Christianity but is true of all religious expressions. Sociologists call this the routinization of charisma and say it accounts for the decline of religious organizations and people movements.

What happens in the beginning of a movement is that the people encounter the divine in a profound and revelatory way, but with successive generations this encounter tends to fade like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy.

What begins as a revolutionary, life-transforming, confrontation with Jesus eventually subsides into a codified religion and is subsequently incorporated into normal social life.

And herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for all people of faith: Although genuine faith is born out of direct encounters with God, it cannot survive and prosper without some form of stability and order. Viewed positively, rituals, creeds, and structures are meant to preserve and facilitate the God encounter. In fact, we believe this is what they initially were designed for. But unfortunately, when the original encounter begins to fade and the ritual, creeds, and rules intended to preserve the encounter will no longer match the inward experience and spiritual condition of the participants. At that point, renewal and constant renewals become necessary... hence the need to re Jesus.

It is, as O'Dea says, a dilemma born of the tragedy inherent in the human condition in a fallen world. But for the disciple, the simple truth must remain: we cannot substitute the God encounter in rituals, priesthoods, and theological formulas. We all need to encounter God directly.

The same is true for our defining relationship with Jesus. It is like the story of the Israelites in the wilderness. They tried to store up the manna from heaven for another day. Religion can give into the same temptation to try to store up and rely on the souvenirs of a past spiritual experience. For how many years did the church rely on the system of holy Christian relics—a bone from Peter's finger, a wooden shard from the cross of Christ, cathedrals and sacred buildings, inherited rituals, even creedal formulas, more than it relied on a fresh, daily encounter with Jesus? We, like Israel, are called to be willing to collect the fresh manna every day—and we are to do this without becoming spiritual thrill seekers but rather lifelong worshipers. To do otherwise is to "outsource your encounter with Jesus" to a religious system of souvenirs, ritual, and religious paraphernalia. Said Maurice Friedman:

> Theophany happens to man, and he has his part in it as God has His. [Religious] forms are meant to preserve the encounter, but they can never substitute for it. The God of the Bible is not an idea but God. [Genuine] religious reality means this; it is the undiminished reality of the encounter.[^4]

The more one replaces a fresh daily encounter with Jesus with religious forms, over time he is removed from his central place in the life of the church.

The result of this removal (by whatever means) is the onset of dead religion in the place of a living faith.[^5] And to be honest, much of what has gone under the name Christendom can readily be called religion and not Christianity as defined by the Bible. Centuries ago, Blaise Pascal uttered these incisive words about the spiritual condition of the Christianity of his day: "Christendom is a union of people who, by means of the sacraments, excuse themselves from their duty to love God."[^6] And while religious people tend to be sincere, they do use religion to qualify the God experience–to soften it and control it. One of the functions of religion, sociologically speaking, includes that of avoiding God. All attempts to reduce the faith to intellectualism, or to condition our understanding of God, or to domesticate Jesus, or to diminish the call to lifelong discipleship will result in the loss of the God experience and the encroachment of some form of religion. Anglican missiologist John V. Taylor says, "We need not go all the way with Karl Barth in defining all religion as unbelief. But... it is plain that man uses religion as a way of escaping from God. This is true of Christianity as of any other religious system."[^7] And it was yet another Anglican who rightly said, "Jesus was inaugurating a way of life which had no further need of the Temple."[^8] Any attempt then to reconstruct a temple theology of church goes clean contrary to the work of Jesus. He is the new temple.

Martin Buber, the great articulator of dialogical Hebraic spirituality, says that what were originally the true forms of the God encounter soon deteriorate and then become obstacles or substitutes for God. We do very well to listen to his warning:

> The ur-danger of man is "religion" and mystic ecstasy. It may be that the forms... then they eventually cease to embody the consecration of the lived, everyday world and religious service then begin to run on unapproachably parallel lines. When the partner in the communion is no longer there, the worshipper gesticulates into the void. The form that becomes independent, the devotion, the reaching-out, the absorption-in, from the fullness of life, becomes instead detached from life. Now the soul only thinks she is serving Him and for Him alone, and not on His world. Now, the soul thinks, the world is only a figment in herself, the dialogue which she thinks she is carrying on is no longer there.[^9]

As harsh as this might seem, the Hebrew Bible sustains a constant critique of its own religious forms. Psalm 50 is a classic example of a prophetic critique of religious ritual that has lost its connection to the covenantal relationship between God and his people. They were obsessed with the forms of worship, but the relationship toward God could not be fulfilled through religious ritual, but only with a heart that truly seeks God. The prophets wring their hands. For instance, Isaiah cries, "The Lord said: Because these people draw near with their mouths and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their worship of me is a human commandment learned by rote" (Isa 29:13). It is not the ritual itself that the prophet rails against; it is the loss of covenantal worship. It is the substitution of form for relationship.

## Christianity as Antireligion

As we are thinking about the dangers of formulaic religion, it might be useful to take a look at the Pharisees. Most readers of the New Testament would agree that the Pharisees are often portrayed as the bad guys and not the good guys. But were they really that bad? What do we know about them?

Well, from the Bible and from historical research, we can say that

- They were very sincere in their belief system.
- They were an extremely zealous and passionate bunch—the commitment of a suicide bomber would probably be similar to the intensity of their devotion.
- They were meticulous tithers and gave beyond what was required (they even tithed on things that were not required to be tithed).
- They upheld a strong moral code—they were very decent people.
- They believed in the authority of the full Hebrew Scriptures. And they were the conservatives of their day, who limited the canon to the first five books and then expanded it.
- They believed in miracles. They believed that God can and did intervene in human affairs. Against the theological liberalism of their day, they affirmed the resurrection (the ultimate miracle), which the Sadducees denied.
- They were the keepers of the tradition, and therefore the custodian of the identity of Israel. It is unlikely Israel would have survived without their contribution.
- They were what we would call missional. Imbued with messianic causes, they went over land and sea to make just one convert.
- They prayed arduously and often with set prayers prescribed for all possible situations in life.
- They were strongly messianic. They longed for Israel's (and the world's) redemption.

We would be wrong to characterize Pharisees as mean-spirited people with nothing but evil on their minds. Generally they were sincere and well-meaning people. Whatever we might think of the Judaism of Jesus' time was, they were nonetheless exemplary religious people.

We might want to ask ourselves the question, "Which brand of contemporary Christianity most closely adopts this form of spirituality?" To which we must surely answer, "It is the Bible-believing Christians... the evangelicals." And yet, these were the people who were most responsible for putting Jesus on the cross. What does this tell us? What does this come if we are not attentive to the dynamics involved in the slow erosion of the faith? It tells us that even well-meaning and sincere people when they lose focus on the central issues can become the enemies of the very thing they seek to preserve. The realization is complete when we remember that these fine, upright, devoted religious people were the ones who killed Jesus.

But let's press this exercise even further. Remember that, theologically speaking, Jesus was a true Pharisee. He affirmed all the things on that list regarding the authority of the Bible, the reality of miracles, the resurrection, the messianic hope. So what was the difference? The difference is in how we inhabit the theology we adhere to—how we believe it. Divorced from love, theology becomes a weapon.

And here again Jesus is the key. Without the active love for, and presence of, the radical Jesus, Christianity easily degenerates into an oppressive religion.

Make no mistake, the Christendom project is full of atrocities perpetrated in the name of religion; the Inquisition and the Crusades stand out, but they were not isolated incidents. One can even argue that it is partly from the snares of religion that Jesus came to save us. We do well to remember the judgment that came upon the legalistic moralism that the Judaism at the time of Jesus had degenerated into. The parables of judgment have ongoing validity to all religious people, not just the scribes and the Pharisees.

While teaching at a seminary in the American Bible Belt, Alan once posed the question, "What would we do with Jesus if he turned up at our churches?" One brave soul answered with heart-stopping honesty, "We would crucify him." It is disturbingly true. But the disquieting question remains: what would your local church do if the Jesus portrayed in the Scriptures, came into the community? For most of our churches, he would be a very uncomfortable mix. Jacques Ellul is absolutely right when he says that

> For the Romans nascent Christianity was not at all a new religion. It was 'antireligion.'... What the first Christian generations were putting on trial was the very principle of religion in the known world.[^10]

Christianity claims not to be a religion that is superior to others, but to be an antireligion that refutes all the religions that attempt to link us with a divine being through a system of mediation. And the Christian religion itself is constantly called into question by the absolute claims of Jesus.

In Jesus we have the undoing of all that we call religion. In the place of a mediating system with its temples, rituals, creeds, and priestly cultus, he opens up the God experience to all and shatters the oppressive religious systems. That Jesus signaled the demise of the temple system is clear. Says N. T. Wright, "Jesus came to do what the temple was meant to do."[^11] A cursory reading of Mark reveals that immediately after his Spirit baptism and temptation, Jesus begins to confront the forces that oppress human life—the demonic forces and the religious system. His ministry is one of liberation. The kingdom of God breaks out among those whom the religious system had marginalized. And those who use religion to control people find themselves under the judgment of God (e. g., Matt 23:13–39). And all of Jesus' actions and teachings call into question any attempt to localize and thus mediate and control God through the operation of religious systems. It is difficult to see Jesus fitting into any religious system. In him is the undoing of religion.

And because of this, the religious people hated Jesus and constantly plotted to kill him... and eventually did, in cahoots with the politicians and the mob. And we would suggest that all religious people will likewise resist Jesus because he will effectively invalidate the system that they have so deeply invested in. To follow Jesus means to allow the strange and wonderful God-Man to invade our life with purpose and meaning. Christ is the antidote to religion.

## The Founder and the Found

Part of the basis to this claim comes from an understanding of the defining role that Jesus plays for the movement that sprang from his life and work. In all people-movements, including religious movements, there is typically a founder whose vision and life give shape to the movement that forms from the work and teachings of that person. In some rare cases, a movement can evolve beyond its founder, taking on a broader vision or a new philosophical base while still maintaining some connection to the original (feminism, for instance, it has evolved from the original suffragettes to modern-day feminism). But in the case of Christianity, the link between the founder and the found is critical for the health of Christian movements.

Max Weber, the famous sociologist, was one of the first to broker these insights when he described the role of the "charismatic leader" in the founding of a movement. The charismatic leader in his view is distinguished from other types of leaders by the fact that his or her authority comes from the personal charisma of the leader him or herself. And the source of this authority exists apart from any status or office. In the case of religious movements, particularly religious movements that survive beyond the first generation, the charismatic leader is someone who in a crisis situation puts forward a radically alternative vision of the world and then demonstrates the power and validity of that vision. This annunciation of a radical vision and mission subsequently attracts followers who have similar experiences or encounters that further validate the charismatic's mission. And so we find that movements that maintain their vitality are those that constantly return to the radical message of the founder.[^12]

The point we make in referring to Weber here is that he rightly understood the critical factors that made for significant people movements and the role of the founder as decisive, not only for the initiation of the religious movement but for its ongoing renewal and health. He also noted that in order to survive the loss of the founder, the movement must institutionalize and become an organization.[^13] He said, "The genuine charismatic situation quickly gives rise to a structure of devotion and fever."[^14] In fact, it was Weber who coined the phrase we mentioned earlier: the routinization of charisma.

Thomas O'Dea refers to these catalyzing encounters that kick-start religious movements as "charismatic moments." But he notes that successive generations tend to construct religious systems to take the place of the original encounter. "In order to survive its charismatic moment," he writes, "worship must become stabilized in established forms and procedures."[^15] In fact, he argues that this is an unavoidable paradox for religious movements.[^16] Religious movements cannot survive without those structures taking on a life of their own and corrupting what they were meant to preserve. And yet, religious experiences of themselves will not sustain a religious movement.

And herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for religious organizations: although religious movements are born out of firsthand religious experiences, in order to survive and grow, the charism (the originating grace or gift) has to be diffused, ritualized, and mediated so that it becomes accessible through the organization itself. While O'Dea saw this process of institutionalization as necessary, he also recognized that paradoxically the process that would dilute or possibly even obliterate the original charism. The very structures meant to preserve the charism has a tendency to snuff out the life it was meant to protect and enhance. The forms become empty when they no longer match the inward experience and spiritual condition of the participants. Decline becomes inevitable, and renewal and constant renewals become necessary... hence the need to re Jesus.

Weber maintained that the process of institutionalization and renewal involved a constant return to the charismatic center in order to relegitimize, renew, and revitalize the movement. In other words, religious organizations require a form of renewal that requires a return to the founding charism. Whether we are talking about a denomination or to Christianity as a whole, one can call this rediscovery of the founding charism "radical traditionalism"—returning to the organization's deepest tradition and reinterpreting it for a new context.

In fact, there is a certain way of thinking and acting within an organization that can be traced back to its founder. This is called the organization's "culture," and it consists of:

- The beliefs, values, and assumptions of its founders
- The validation of these beliefs through the learning experiences of the group
- The enhancement of these beliefs by the new beliefs, values, and assumptions brought by new group members.

But we can say categorically that the impact of the founder is the most important factor in determining the resultant culture of an organization or movement. For the church, this means we must constantly return to Jesus, or simply re Jesus.

In the formation of Christianity we can clearly see all these forces at work. In the New Testament (even the word "new" implies a departure from, and a critique of, the old), we see how Jesus redefined what people had previously understood and experienced the kingdom of God. As the Messiah, Jesus bypassed the religious institution that has inadvertently begun to block its access for the people, for all who would draw near (e. g., Matt 11:28–30; 21:43; John 4:21–24). He is the mediator and initiator of a new covenant with the people of God. He initiated a way of life and a way of being in the world that was not a religion but takes its cue from him. We also know from the Gospels that Jesus called people to follow him, to learn the ways of the kingdom and to disciple and teach them to recognize what it means to be a disciple. These are thus built into the system at its inception.

It was Peter Berger who alerted us to the fact that reality is in fact socially constructed. The social process is exactly how leaders get their ideas and values passed on to their followers. Sometimes this happens in the form of commands, as we can see in some aspects of Jesus' teaching.

But they are generally passed on to the followers through a combination of socialization, through the charismatic power of the founder, and by acting, by doing, by living out confidence in the message.

They knew they were bound to his teaching and template. Any apostolic development of the teachings of Jesus are authentic only insofar that they refer directly to the person, and extend the work of, Jesus. They are all bound to Jesus and cannot speculate beyond that. They can, however, interpret Jesus and his teachings for new contexts. The message adapts and evolves, but the nascent ethos of the founder is maintained. This is exactly what we see in the New Testament. A good practice was given to us by Paul who spent his best energies in establishing the centrality of the Messiah, in terms of both his person (e. g., Ephesians and Colossians) and his work. All doctrine must be validated by the revelation given in and through Jesus (Gal 1:8; Col 1:15–20; 1 Cor 3:11; etc.). Only then can it be considered true and authentic.

Early on, the original church had cause to recalibrate to Jesus. The original believers were largely Jews, and The Way was considered a sect under Judaism. Their understanding of the faith was colored by their Jewish nationalism. For instance, expectations of a restored Israel and a temple liberated from foreign control, Jerusalem and the temple were brutally destroyed in AD 70. The Jewish believers had cause to seriously rethink the bases of the faith. Their understanding of Jesus had to be recalibrated. Within one generation the Christian movement was already forced back to its founder to rediscover what it was really all about. What else could they do? The Christian movement would have ample reason to do this throughout its history. This is what renewal and mission of the church is all about.

And remember, we are talking here about both the founder and the found. Whatever sociological process we might use to understand the role of the founder, the key point is that the found must somehow strive to embody the life, ideals, and reality of that founder. Like the founder, the lives of the found must embody the founder's life and mission. This is the process of embodiment, which is so essential to authentic discipleship.

This must surely partly be what it means to live "in Christ" and he in us. Observers should be able to encounter Jesus in and through the life and community of his followers. People observing us ought to be able to discern the elements of Jesus' way in our ways. If they cannot find authentic signals of the historical Jesus through the life of his people, then as far as we are concerned they have the full right to question our legitimacy.

Tony Campolo tells the story of a drunk who was miraculously converted at a Bowery mission in New York. Like all Campolo stories, it has a jokey punch line that betrays a far more serious and convicting point.

The drunk, Joe, was known throughout the Bowery as the worst kind of wino, a hopeless derelict of a man, living on borrowed time. But following his conversion, Joe became the most transformed person that anyone associated with the mission had ever known. He spent his days and nights serving the other men at the mission. He mopped up vomit and urine and cleaned up drunks whatever their condition.

He considered nothing too demeaning for him.

One evening, when the director of the mission was delivering his evening evangelistic message to the usual crowd of still and sullen men, their heads hung in penitence and exhaustion, there was one man who looked up, listened intently, and then began to cry out to God, asking him to change. The repentant drunk kept shouting, "Oh God, make me like Joe!" The director, somewhat embarrassed by this, went over and said to the man, "Son, I think it would be better if you prayed, 'Make me like Jesus.'" The man looked up with a confused look on his face and asked, "Is he like Joe?"[^17]

The New Testament writers likewise call people to emulate their example, knowing that they had committed their lives to Jesus and that he in them. It was their commitment to the embodiment of Jesus' message to be able to say "follow my example." This might seem like arrogance to us, but, like the ex-drunk in the story, they had become a living embodiment of Jesus. It was Jesus he was pointing to, but it was through their lives that people could see Jesus. They lived in Christ and he in them. It is out of this conviction that he could say,

> Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. (1 Cor 11:1)

> Join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us. (Phil 3:17)

> For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you... (2 Thess 3:7)

Note how in Philippians 3:17 he also directs his readers to observe others whose lives mirror that of Jesus. In effect, the found are to replicate the founder.

But to push the point a little further, consider the difference between Christianity and Islam. In both cases, the founder sets the primary pattern for others to follow—they provide the authenticating human image of the spiritual ideal. There is an expectation of continuity between the founder and the follower. So, when we see a Christian acting in a viciously violent and unloving way, we can say that that person or organization has betrayed Jesus. We can say that one cannot follow Jesus and at the same time act in ways deeply inconsistent with the life and teachings of Jesus. They distort the reality of love and justice that are at the heart of Christianity as defined by Jesus. They distort the reality of love and justice.

But in the case of Islam, the founder set an entirely different model from that of Jesus. The Koran depicts Muhammed as a passionately spiritual man who called people into the worship of Allah. And there are some great things about Muhammed. But the Koran also depicts him as a man with a rigid morality, an assertive sexuality, a bad temper, and displays of violence. When Islam acts similarly it is not entirely inconsistent with its founder at this point.

However, when Christianity is warlike and voracious, it betrays Jesus in a significant way. This is why racism, the Crusades, the Inquisition, or the religious wars are such profound distortions of the faith—apostate because they run contrary to the faith expressed in Jesus. The founder's essence must imbue the movement because we get our sense of place and our sense of purpose from him.

The following table will give the reader a feel of what we are saying here: we ought to get a feel of what a religion stands for by examining the lives and teachings of the founders (or key figures).[^18]

## Discerning the Inner Voice of the Organization

But beyond the role of the founder in the ongoing renewal of the church, we must briefly return to the idea of radical traditionalism. Another useful way of conceiving the renewal of organizations is to talk in terms of reform and renewal. Steve Addison calls this discerning the inner voice of the organization.[^19]

Drawing on the insights of organizational theorist Robert Quinn,[^20] Addison says that rather than us finding a purpose, a purpose finds us. Quinn argues that every organization has a core purpose embedded in its DNA, a purpose that exists at its core. Following this cue, then, we can say that in various forms of organizational renewal, the task is not to help organizations find their purpose, but to help them rediscover it, to train them to listen for the inner voice of the organization. Often, an organization with its inner voice will threaten the existing culture, whose central purpose might have been lost or obscured. Listening for the inner voice of an organization is often the first step toward revitalizing a movement.

Similarly, in his study of religious orders, Lawrence Cada refers to the "founding charism" of an order to describe its unique vision of the world transformed by the gospel.[^21] The use of the term charism (grace) implies that this is not something created by human effort but is a gift given to the organization—a divine bequest, unique to that particular organization. And the process of renewal is about the discovery of an organization's true identity and mission. The purpose is not found in the vision of the leader or group but in God's calling. If this is so, then the key to the renewal of any Christian organization is the rediscovery of its founding charism.

But as mentioned earlier, this must not be the blind return to traditionalism but an innovative insight into how the founding charism is to be expressed in new contexts. Radical traditionalism involves the founder's vision matched with spectacular innovations that are as yet unimagined. It is both a return to tradition and a departure from it. It is a radical return to tradition.

While many people use the term "radical" to mean a departure from the traditional, it refers to a return to the root cause of a thing. Webster defines radical as "of or going to the root or origin; fundamental: as 'a radical change'; 'a radical reform'; 'a radical party.'"

We have been called radicals in our time, but using this definition, aren't we all meant to be radicals in some form or another? We are hardly calling for anything new. We are simply calling for a return to the most fundamental cause. If that's radical, then we are radicals indeed!

Central to the organizational renewal process is the rediscovery of the organization's identity and at the same time the innovative interpretation of that identity for new contexts. There must be both continuity and discontinuity in the revitalization process, involving both a conservative dimension (preserving the core) and an innovative dimension (reinterpreting for new contexts). Volkswagen's innovative reinterpretation of the Beetle to illustrate this process. This iconic car was reintroduced in the new millennium. The new Beetle that emerged definitely has continuity with the original but is also completely reimagined for a new era. It is both a return to tradition and a powerful illustration of radical traditionalism involved in refounding movements.

But we can also learn from educational psychology in this matter. Jean Piaget, the great educational psychologist, conducted much of his early research on the streets of Geneva, interviewing children and observing how they played games. He noticed that younger children unquestioningly played games according to the inherited rules. They slavishly followed the rules their parents had taught them how to play that way. Piaget then noted that as children got older, they began to question these rules and sometimes throw these rules away. A rule-less game of marbles on the streets of Geneva was the result. But then, these same children, fed up with chaotic games that were always won by bullies, rediscovered the rules. Piaget noted how much more powerfully these rules worked in the lives of the older children. The difference now was that they had discovered these rules as an antidote to chaos rather than simply inheriting them. This process of childhood development mirrors what we've been discussing.

What we are advocating is a radical traditionalism. The church needs to follow the same path as the children did with their games of marbles. Re Jesus means letting go of our blind allegiance to religious rules inherited from our parents and forebears. It means rediscovering the rules for ourselves. The path will be not bedlam but a rediscovery of the way of Jesus, a rediscovery of the authentic. Jesus, as our founder, is our guide on this path. His words and his life show us the way. This is how we bring the church and the gospel into new contexts of traditional radicalism.
