# I've Got a Picture of Jesus

 Fo u r

## It’s been said often enough, but it bears repeating:

without the real human Jesus of Nazareth, we are at the mercy of anybody who tells us that “Christ” is this, or that.

 —N. T. Wright
 Our passion for Jesus is the only passion that will not destroy us.
 —Larry Crabb
 To embrace the radical traditionalism we have been discussing requires a
 rediscovery of our foundation—the person, Jesus. It will require us to let
 go of our much-loved but inaccurate assumptions about him and be prepared
 to venture back to the Gospels to see him in all his strange radicalness. We
 benign images of gentle Jesus, meek and mild, have comforted and encourrecord and to be brave enough to encounter the disquieting, unsettling, perIt has been said that God made us in his image, and we returned the
 favor (was it Voltaire?). This innate tendency to co-opt God to our own egos
 and agendas is deeply embedded in the human condition. An illustration:
 with a worship leader for each of his sessions. Michael was calling the parleader, though, was on an entirely different page. He spoke about Jesus as a
 through a visuali­zation experience in which they were to imagine themselves
 were invited to cuddle him, secure in his love and knowing he adored them
 Michael stood up after this and spoke about the wild, radical, mysterious,

 In fact, the shift required by the participants to get from the warm, sentimental Jesus of the worship leader to the wild, revolutionary Jesus of the
 keynote speaker was so great that Michael and the worship leader met for

During this conversation, the worship leader spoke about growing up in a cold and austere German family, with a distant, unpleasable father. All his life he had tried to fulfill his father’s high standards, only to fall short time and again. It was through discovering the unconditional love of Jesus that he finally felt free from the scathing and debilitating self-criticism that he had inherited from his childhood. This experience had been so formative that it had shaped his whole view of Jesus. His Jesus had become an endlessly loving daddy-figure, a sentimental parent who was proud of his son and who cheered him on and was thrilled with his every achievement no matter how small. Can you see how our understanding of Jesus can be so easily shaped by our own psychospiritual needs? Show me your Jesus, and I’ll tell you who you are.

 So, was the worship leader wrong? Doesn’t Jesus love us unconditionally? Of course he does, but we need to know what it means for Jesus to love
 us lest we romanticize it and thus distort the type of love that Jesus has for
 action and sacrifice more than just feelings? And besides, is that really all
 why would anyone have wanted him dead? No one wants to kill a big ball of
 knowledge that his whole public ministry was marked by a resolute march
 and barely flinches from it all the way to Golgotha. We don’t mean to sound
 with because of poor parenting. Jesus unquestionably meets that deep need.

But if we limit Jesus to the meeting of our psychological needs, we end up following only part of Jesus. That’s how we get this daddy-hunger Jesus.

 Earlier we talked about the distorted view of Jesus promulgated by the
 Ku Klux Klan. Since their deepest need is to justify their fear and loathing of
 blacks and Jews, they construct racist Jesus. Similarly, many churches have
 middle-class Jesus, or a meek and mild Jesus who speaks in platitudes that
 tural distortion, baby-in-a-manger Jesus, a harmless little child that everyone

Our concern here is not to suggest that Jesus doesn’t address our deep longings and needs but rather to affirm that he can never be limited to meeting those deep longings. Sometimes he challenges those needs. Many of us are familiar with the scene in C. S. Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, when Lucy is about to meet Aslan the lion, the allegorical Christ figure in the books. She asks Mr. Beaver, “Is he safe?” “ ‘Safe?’ said Mr. Beaver... ‘Who said anything about safe? ’Course he isn’t safe, but he’s good. He’s the King, I tell you.’ ”1 Following Jesus is never safe when it comes to our culturally adopted lifestyles, but it is always good.

 To be sure, there are times when the word we hear from Jesus is, “I have
 desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under
 her wings.” But at other times it might just as well be, “Do you not perceive Do you have ears, and fail to hear?” Both these statements appear on the lips of Jesus. The first one, from Luke 13:34, refers to his love for the people of Israel, and the second, from Mark 8:17, is directed in frustration toward his disciples. Our point is that Jesus was more than willing to express his disappointment and annoyance at his friends as well as his love and compassion.

We need to remember that even though he deeply loved his disciples (John 17, for instance), he also continued to surprise, amaze, frighten, disturb, and challenge them. To limit Jesus to a spiritual tap that can be turned on and off according to our need for affirmation is a terrible mistake. It leads to us remaking Jesus in our image, rather than us being molded to his likeness.

 In Talladega Nights, Will Ferrell, in typical over-the-top style, plays the
 fictional Nascar champion, Ricky Bobby. In a mostly inane film, filled with ridiculous set pieces, one scene surprises us. Ricky Bobby sits down to dinner
 Chip; and his racing partner, Cal, and says grace. Addressing his prayer to
 Dominoes, KFC, and Taco Bell set before him, as well as for his family and
 Chip’s bad leg, at which point his wife, Carly, interjects:
 Carly: You know Jesus did grow up. You don’t always have to call him “baby.”
 Ricky: I like the Christmas Jesus best and I’m sayin’ grace. When you say grace
 want... [continues praying] Dear tiny Jesus, with your golden fleece diapers,
 Chip [yelling]: He was a man! He had a beard.

 Inspired by this discussion about Jesus, Ricky’s friend Cal decides to throw in his favorite image as well:
 Cal: I like to picture Jesus in a tuxedo T-shirt, cos it says, like, I wanna be formal,
 but I’m here to party too. I like to party, so I like my Jesus to party.
 Cal: I like to picture Jesus with, like, giant eagle’s wings, and singin’ lead vocals
 hammered drunk.
 After Carly puts an end to the theological discussion by asking Ricky to finish saying grace, he continues praying: “Dear eight-pound, six-ounce infant
 tent, we just thank you...”2
 The bulk of Ricky’s prayer is an expression of gratitude for his hot wife,

 his success on the track, and the millions of dollars he’s made in endorsePowerade). The whole scene is a farcical reminder of the temptation felt by

 To paraphrase Anne Lamott, you know you’ve remade Jesus in your own
 image when he hates all the same people you hate! We have all tried to shoehorn Jesus into our own agendas, making him hate those we hate, whether
 not even his own community could compel Jesus in that way. In Luke 4, Jesus
 scroll of the prophet Isaiah. The first half of his sermon that day is often reannounced, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing” (Luke

But it is every bit as radical as his announcement that he is the fulfillment of the prophecy made in Isaiah 61. It is so radical, in fact, that his audience was prepared to murder him. What does he say?

 He plucks from the pages of 1 and 2 Kings two stories that have appeared in so many children’s Sunday school curricula that their potency has been leached from the narrative. And yet they are both subversive and radical Zarephath in Sidon (1 Kgs 17:8–24). Of all the widows in Israel to whom God a Sidonite, says Jesus. But furthermore, as if to press his case even harder, Jesus

Of all the lepers in Israel, God chose to heal the leader of one of their enemy’s armed forces. What do the widow at Zarephath and General Naaman of Syria have in common? They were both outsiders, enemies, despised by Israel. And yet it is to both of them that the grace of God is revealed. Indeed, in the widow’s case, it is through her that God’s grace is revealed. Jesus picks two characters he knows his Sabbath-day audience in Nazareth would have hated, and he dares his audience to admit that God loved them as much as anyone in Israel. He will not be co-opted, even by Israel, to a cause fueled by hatred and racism.

 Later, the religious leaders of Israel send an emissary to try to trick Jesus
 into making politically inflammatory statements against Rome. We know how
 cleverly Jesus repels their trick with his statement, “Give therefore to the emperor
 22:21), but it’s the emissary’s opening line that caught our eye: “We know you are
 ence to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality” (Matt 22:16).
 No doubt, these are falsely flattering words. But we can’t help but notice the irony of Jesus’ enemies correctly identifying the fact that he cannot
 constantly persist in trying to co-opt him for our purposes?
 Having said that, we are not foolish enough to suggest that knowing

 Jesus is a purely objective task. Of course, we all bring our own needs, hopes,

 Vandalizing Our Portraits of Jesus
 One of the best ways to expose our co-option of Jesus to our own personal, religious, and cultural agendas is to interpret the many images of him
 first emerged when, as a boy, he vandalized his parents’ much-loved icon.

Murillo converted the holy and other-worldly image of Jesus the shepherd boy into the depiction of a playful, rough-and-ready Spanish child. With the intuition of a child, young Murillo couldn’t bear the almost frightening image of the pristine holy boy that hung in his childhood home. He had to rescue Jesus from the gilt frame and put him back on the dusty streets of Seville. We respond to this story strongly.

 The thought of the young Murillo vandalizing his family’s icon stays
 with us and informs a good deal of what we do. We see ourselves as iconoclasts, as holy vandals, defacing the church’s cherished but unhelpful images
 of the worship leader just mentioned. Others are sinister, like the KKK’s Aryan
 people off in an unhelpful trajectory. Allow us to apply our vandals’ spray

## The Bearded-Lady Jesus

 In the early 1850s, William Holman Hunt, one of the founders of the
 avant-garde Pre-Raphaelite movement, painted an immeasurably popular picture, The Light of the World. In this image, Jesus is standing outside a
 door with the back of his open hand. In his other hand he holds a jewelwith twisted branches silhouetted against the setting sun. It seems that Jesus

## Spooky Jesus

 Another series of images of Jesus that affects the imaginations of many
 can go under the heading of what we call spooky Jesus. They are similar to
 the bearded-lady Jesus in that they present a somewhat feminized picture of
 elements to the picture. These immensely popular portrayals of Jesus presauras (probably to ensure that the viewer would not miss the fact of his dito portray Christ’s divinity at the expense of his humanity. It’s as if his God

 right to reject any notions that diminished his humanity. Portrayals like

When we look at the Jesus of the Gospels, we find that in fact this was exactly what Jesus was not. The incarnation emphasizes the fact that Jesus’ humanity so contained the divinity of Jesus that his family, his neighbors, his friends, and even his disciples did not fully realize that God was present in the human person that they encountered in Jesus—so hidden was his divinity in his humanity. Glowing halos, exposed hearts, and dramatic posturing—all regularly included in these depictions—take us away from the Gospels rather than toward the real Jesus.

 If the William Holman Hunt Jesus is a benign, insipid, emasculated man,
 then spooky Jesus is an otherworldly and distant being. One raps respectfully
 at the door to your heart, while the other waits serenely for you to approach
 you to show us your Jesus and you said he looked like spooky Jesus, we’d

 And yet the Jesus we meet in the Gospels is at times frustrated, angry,

 Scott Peck once noted that one of the chief reasons for his trusting
 the Gospels was their all-too-real description of Jesus. In his agnostic days,
 before reading them, he had assumed that the Gospels were simply works
 those of his followers committed to creating a cult of personality around him.

However, when Peck first read the texts themselves, he was astonished to discover that the Jesus in their pages was nothing like the Romanesque icons he had seen before. He was richer, more textured, more authentically human than any invented folk hero could possibly be. In fact, Peck went on to conclude that the Gospels must be true. If they were inventions by Jesus’ followers, those followers would have invented a better messiah than the one found in the Gospels. By that he meant that they would have invented a flawless messiah, one who never showed fear, sadness, or anger. That he isn’t a “perfect” Jesus was proof enough that the Gospel writers were faithful reporters, not cunning inventors.

## Ordinary Galilean Jesus

 N. T. Wright was noted for having said that after the novelist and amateur
 New Testament scholar A. N. Wilson had finished with Jesus, all we were left
 with was “a moderately pale Galilean.”5 In fact, Wilson epitomizes that approach

 popular book, Jesus: A Life, Wilson concludes rather dramatically that if Jesus
 greater than it was when he cried out, ‘My God, why hast thou forsaken me?’”6
 According to Wilson, Jesus didn’t think he was the messiah, far less the

 second person of the Trinity. He was born in an ordinary fashion in Nazareth,
 of indestructible inner kingdom than any external reality. He tried to raise
 when some people tried to foist certain messianic pretensions upon him, he
 was buried in Galilee. Ultimately, he failed. His message was not taken up.

When his brother James set about rehabilitating his damaged reputation by reassuring his followers that all had happened according to the Scripture, some people mistook him for his dead brother and a rumor began circulating that Jesus had been resurrected. But the resurrected Jesus was no more than James, who bore a striking family resemblance to his now-deceased brother the hasid, or holy man.

 For Wilson, Paul is the great inventor of Christianity. Paul took the sayings of Jesus and the passion of the earliest Christians and constructed the
 complex theology of the New Testament, moving it far away from the simple

 Wilson’s speculation gives us a Jesus who is an ordinary itinerant
 story­teller and religious guru. He probably married (some writers believe he
 married Mary Magdalene and fathered children or a child with her). Jesus is

 what a typical Jewish man in Palestine looked like two thousand years ago.

The heavy brow, swarthy complexion, and thick features are a world away from the bearded lady or the Romanesque Jesus. According to Wilson, this is the Galilean we mistook for the savior of the world.

 Suffice to say, this is an image of Jesus that’s not too popular in churches.

Try this: conduct an exercise with church folk or even seminarians. Display a number of images of Jesus, including the ones we’ve looked at here, and ask them to rank the images from favorite to least favorite. It has been our experience that in almost every case, the BBCJesus ranks last. Church folk seem to prefer their Jesus to look more impressive than this guy. However, we strongly suspect that outside the church, more and more people are being taken by the ordinary Galilean of Wilson. For instance, Robert Funk from the Jesus Seminar paints Jesus as a radical, gadfly, and social deviant who serves up some alternate construction of reality through his esoteric parables. Funk’s colleague, John Dominic Crossan, offers a Jesus who was setting up an egalitarian community in Galilee by free healing and meals open to all comers. For them, Jesus is more easily dealt with as a great poet or a teacher of love. Of course this only begs the question, how does the poet-cum-socialworker Jesus heal the sick? The silence is deafening.

 Such attempts to domesticate and secularize Jesus are flawed from the
 start. When rock star Bono was challenged that Jesus could be ranked among
 the world’s great thinkers, but that to consider him the son of God was farNo, it’s not farfetched to me. Look, the secular response to the Christ story

## Revolutionary Jesus

 As we have noted already, the Gospel story makes clear that those who
 understood Jesus and his message the best were those who most wanted him
 dead. He was considered a threat and a danger to the religious system of Juthe bearded-lady Jesus, spooky Jesus, or ordinary Galilean Jesus threatening
 religion, a blasphemer, a heretic, a drunkard, a glutton, and a false teacher.

He was an unschooled rabbi from the God-forsaken north who had run amok and begun to stir up trouble among the equally uneducated populace. In his enemies’ minds he was an extremist, a radical, a revolutionary.

 There have been a few attempts over the years to react against the
 insipid depictions of Jesus. In the 1960s, the radical I talian filmmaker Pier
 Paolo Pasolini, a homosexual, a communist, and an atheist to boot, made a
 man, nearly always shrouded in a dark hood, presenting his parables not as
 demanding, insisting that he’s come not to bring peace but a sword. Pasolini

The usual image of the local parson hardly correlates with the Che-Jesus image below.

 In the correct sense of the terms, Jesus was probably more a reformer
 than a revolutionary. He wasn’t committed to overturning the whole religious system of which he was part. Indeed, as he points out, “Do not think

 Is it any wonder that those equally beholden to the structures of the
 religious institutions of Christendom are just as concerned about the revolutionary Jesus being set loose in their churches! Our hope is that church
 now—he just wants to reshape it radically.

## Fully Human Fully Divine Jesus

 One ancient icon seems to us to be more balanced. It was found in the
 monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai desert. While still sporting a dramatic
 halo, the St. Catherine's icon depicts Jesus as tranquil and unruffled. To be
 sure, the artist has none of the spookiness seen in other pictures of Jesus. He
 has a human face. Many spooky Jesus icons characteristically portrayed him
 with a mask-like visage and a radically altered appearance in order to
 convey a sense of the transcendent or the holy. Early Christian artists were
 so concerned with portraying the divine nature of Jesus when representing him in icons, paintings, murals, and stained glass, they erred on the side
 of the divine and lost sight of his humanity. The St. Catherine's icon is more
 flawed, less lovely than the others. Such flaws make it more human.

## The Jesus of the Age

 Having attempted to debunk the many inadequate and even false images of Jesus that distort our true appreciation of him, we acknowledge that
 every age brings with it a new perspective on the multifaceted Jesus who has
 been revealed to us. As limited as these images must be when viewed against
 his wholeness, nonetheless they do reflect something of the concerns of
 the culture and societies of their day. Jaroslav Pelikan has done precisely that
 in his book Jesus Through the Centuries. He argues that the dominant
 image of Jesus created by each successive era is a key to understanding the
 culture and history of the West. The table of contents provides us with a list
 of some of the successive images that have emerged:

 • The Rabbi: informs the early New Testament period, particularly
 the Gospels.
 • The Turning Point of History: encapsulates the increasing significance
 of Jesus in the second century.
 • The Light of the Gentiles: highlights the pagan anticipations of Christ
 among the philosophers of the pre-Christian period.
 • The King of Kings: highlights the lordship of Jesus over against the
 lordship of Caesar culminating in the Constantinian contract and
 the establishment of Christendom.
 • The Cosmic Christ: focuses on Christ as Logos, mind, and reason informing the theology of the third and fourth centuries.
 • The Son of Man: informs the Augustinian Christian psychology and
 anthropology of the fifth century.
 • The True Image: Christ as the inspiration for true art and architecture in the Byzantine period.
 • The Christ Crucified: in the Middle Ages, the cross becomes the
 most significant image in art and literature, emphasizing the saving work of Christ.
 • The Monk Who Rules the World: the triumph of the Benedictine vision
 of monasticism.
 • The Bridegroom of the Soul: the rise of Christian mysticism interprets
 Jesus as the lover of the believer.
 • The Universal Man: the image of the Renaissance period with its
 emphasis on the humanity of Jesus and leads to the transformation of the institutional church.
 • The Mirror of the Eternal: Christ as mirror of the true, the beautiful,
 and the good.
 • The Prince of Peace: the Crusades and the wars of religion also cause
 a reaction in the Anabaptist and Quaker movements, and later in Baptist circles.
 • The Teacher of Common Sense: the image of the eighteenth century
 scholarship and philosophy of the Enlightenment period.
 • The Poet of the Spirit: the image of the nineteenth century arises in
 protest against orthodox rigidity and rationalism.
 • The Liberator: applies to both nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
 This image emphasizes Jesus' prophetic opposition to economic and political oppression and
 his identification with the poor and marginalized.
 • The Man Who Belongs to the World: the unprecedented spread in the
 twentieth century of Christianity to non-Western cultures where
 populations in the Third World come into the fold. Jesus becomes
 a truly global figure in a significant way.
 Although we think that it is just about impossible to sum up an era

 in one image and Pelikan’s choices might seem arbitrary, nonetheless as a
 culture and history of the West. But mostly it is helpful in understanding the
 ful perhaps is seeing that Jesus is all of the above. He is Rabbi, King of kings,
 to limit him to one image is to limit the magnificence of the person that we

## What Kind of Man Is This?

 Some time ago, Michael had the opportunity to conduct a regular worship gathering with a group of people who felt uncomfortable in traditional
 churches. They were an interesting collective of artists, writers, and cultural
 others who had never set foot in a church building. They met for a whole sumby Jesus and had gathered a motley crew of unlikely people together to worartists. Others were suffering with mental illness. Michael and his wife, Carousing uncomplicated symbols like stones, broken pottery, candles, and, of

 One of the features of the gathering was a brief study of John’s Gospel
 followed by a discussion about the text. John’s Gospel launches right in with
 John the Baptist’s ministry and his identification of Jesus as the Lamb of God,
 of the temple and Jesus’ late-night conversation with Nicodemus about being

 What was interesting was how this group approached the text. They
 immediately saw things that most churched groups don't see. They saw Jesus
 siding with the oppressed and the marginalized. They read the scenes at the
 Jordan River as the story of the oppressed and marginalized being led,
 trodden out of the desert through the refreshing waters toward hope and
 restoration. They read the turning of water into wine as his subversive act of
 taking those religious symbols designed to separate the clean from the unclean
 and making them available for all to enjoy. They identified his fury in the
 temple as his shattering of the system that exploited the poor, the system where
 they were forced to change their money and purchase birds for religious sacrifices.
 They overheard Jesus telling Nicodemus about how the transformation he was initiating began with a transformation of the heart, the inner things over which all people have control, not the outer world, which only the rich or powerful have the capacity to change.
 In effect, they read the Gospel as being largely about exile and restoration (not that they would have expressed it in these terms). They read it this
 way because they felt like exiles from institutional religion. To these exiles who
 had been rejected by the church, Jesus is calling everyone, not just the clean, to
 his side. To these exiles who had been told they weren't good enough, the
 wedding at Cana convinced them that in Jesus' kingdom they were welcomed
 and included. The cleansing of the temple presented a Jesus who would stop
 at nothing to demolish every barrier that kept people from God.

 In They Like Jesus but Not the Church, Dan Kimball reports on similar experiences he has had with unchurched people. The title of thebook pretty much
 sums up his main point and summarizes the words of a number of young
 people who have been hurt or alienated by their experiences with people
 in the church.11 This has been our experience as well. That group of desperate
 people we mentioned earlier felt much like the first-century Jews to whom the
 Gospels were first written. They feel exiled and wonder what kind of Jesus will
 restore them? The pristine, pure, serene, bearded lady? He intrigues them, but
 ultimately he belongs in the church world of stained glass and flying buttresses,
 the very world they feel is off limits to them. The ordinary Galilean teacher? At
 least he's safe. He teaches compassion and kindness, and many exiles would
 prefer him to the other options, but ultimately he leads them nowhere. He might
 appeal to their experience of exile, but he promises no restoration.

## Setting Free the Wild Man

 One of the stories told about Jesus goes like this: It was said that people
 didn't venture down to the cliffs on the eastern side of Lake Galilee after dark.
 In fact, even in broad daylight, unless one had a good reason to be on the
 steep and desolate banks on the water's edge it was best to stay away. The wild
 man lived there. An insane, naked man scurried about on all fours out there.
 More like an animal than a man, he ate what he could scavenge from the pigs
 that grazed nearby and slept in the cave-tombs among the bones of the dead.
 His bloodcurdling shrieks could be heard day and night.

 He was the stuff of local legend and lore. Parents threatened bad children with setting the wild man on to them. He has the strength of ten men,
 they warned; no one can hold him down. Half starved and insane, the wild
 both mirth and genuine fear among the residents of the Greek-speaking town
 tion, the better.
 Jews who lived beyond this region had given them all in Gadara up for

 dead. This, the eastern shore of Lake Galilee, was almost entirely populated
 many as ten cities there. Pious Jews had long since left the area to avoid conwonder, some said, that it was overrun by maniacs and lunatics.
 When Jesus stepped out of his boat onto the beach near Gadara, he

 must have suspected what he was in for. Strange it must have seemed to
 his disciples that he would choose to land here. "Leave them to their own
 devices," they would have sniffed. "They are not ours, or God's, concern."

 It’s no mistake that Jesus disembarks at the desolate stretch of shoreline under the steep cliffs near the town. In every likelihood he has spotted
 the wild man from his boat as it approached land. His pathetic wailing and
 least. Where other boatmen would have put to shore far from this madman,
 than the wild man rushes him. This might have scared off many an unwary

 “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to
 God that you won’t torture me,” he shrieks. Such a knowing request betrays
 his condition. He is a demoniac, meaning that his personality is under the
 character. He has been brought to isolation from society, stripped of his

 This man, despised and rejected by men, has not just stumbled fortuitously upon Jesus but has been sought out by him. The demons declare themselves to be in great number. “I am called Legion,” cries the pathetic man,
 not into hell but into a nearby herd of swine. And remarkably, Jesus, having
 the pigs, who end up plunging over the cliffs into the lake and drowning.
 What kind of Messiah accedes to the wishes of demons? What kind of

 Messiah destroys the income of a local swineherd? It would be like blowing
 bloated, drowned pigs floating in Lake Galilee, do they? Shouldn’t the Mesthan do the swineherds. What kind of prophet is this?
 This is the kind of prophet who finds clothes for the wild man, who

 dresses him and feeds him and treats him with the dignity and respect, the
 see what’s happened, the locals find dead pigs, destitute farmers, and the unscares the daylights out of these pagan people. Strong magic has come to

 As Jesus climbs into his boat, the wild man takes his arm. “Let me come
 with you. There’s nothing for me here. I will serve you all my days.”

 Yet while the demons’ request was granted, the wild man’s is denied.

Forced to remain in the Gadarenes, he goes on to be confirmed as part of local lore forever as the wild man who was rehabilitated by the even wilder Messiah from Nazareth.

 Is it any wonder than Jesus is at home among the wild things? He inaugurated his public ministry by fasting for forty days in the wilderness where
 the wild beasts roam. He is untamed and unfettered, and his ministry is inministry as a kind of fugitive. As we’ve seen, after his inaugural sermon in

 ing around in Galilee: “No one who wants to become a public figure acts in
 7:4). Later in that same chapter (v. 32), when the Pharisees send out temple

 Somehow we ignore these indications that Jesus’ public ministry was
 operating “under the radar” with a band of impressionable young men by his
 side. One of his inner circle was Simon the Zealot. The Zealots were an unof Israel. They wanted political freedom but also they wanted a purified, traAs well as the militant Simon, Jesus also attracted James and John. Some New Testament scholars think that their nickname, “the sons of thunder,” may link them to the insurrectionists as well. Furthermore, some of Jesus’ first followers had been disciples of the ascetic and ferociously anti-social John the Baptist. Having attracted these disaffected radicals to his side, Jesus was seen as a danger to society.

 And why wouldn’t he be? Even his friends were somewhat frightened by
 him. When Jesus asks them what people are saying about him, they reply that
 some think he is a resurrected John the Baptist, or even Elijah (Luke 9:18f).

They’re not saying they think he is a real softy, a big, gorgeous guru of love and goodwill. They think he’s a resurrected wild man, for that’s surely what both John and Elijah were when alive. Indeed these rumors had reached even King Herod, who had had John executed (Luke 9:7). John the Baptist back from the dead! That would be a frightening sight.

 Our point is that to re Jesus the church, we need to go back to the daring,
 radical, strange, wonderful, inexplicable, unstoppable, marvelous, unsettling,
 disturbing, caring, powerful God-Man. The communities around us are crying
 are buying mountains of books on popular theology. They are traipsing over
 one who offers them restoration and peace. The church needs to find itself in
 with a trembling voice, “What kind of man is this?” Even the wind and waves
 thought of what he might unleash if left to his own devices.
