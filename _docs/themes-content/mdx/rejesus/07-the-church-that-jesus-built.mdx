# The Church That Jesus Built

 Seven
 The ultimate problem, which has caused our theological helplessness, lies in the separation between Jesus Christ and the Church.

 —D. Ritschl
 The Indian is making an amazing discovery, namely
 that Christianity and Jesus are not the same—that
 built up around Him in the West.

 In 2006, a somewhat eccentric pastor, Jim Henderson, made national news
 when he rented a soul for $504 on e-Bay after its owner offered an open
 mind to the highest bidder. Henderson purchased Matt Casper’s soul, and he
 is Henderson’s book, Jim and Casper Go to Church, a survey of the different apfrom the fresh point of view of an unbelieving outsider.1 Jim and Casper vislow Creek, Erwin McManus’ Mosaic, Joel Osteen’s Lakewood, as well as the
 Dei in Portland, Mars Hill in Seattle, The Bridge in Portland, and the Potter’s
 across the spectrum, from mega-churches to emergent churches (and a bit of

 What did they find? Well, Matt Casper’s perspective certainly is fresh,
 uncluttered as it is by preconceptions and insider knowledge. And his comments do heighten your sensitivity to showy, nonessential forms of church.

He also highlights how churches can miss Jesus’ message by focusing too much on raising money or by talking in indecipherable religious jargon. But the take-home point seems to be, “Why are there such glaring discrepancies among churches regarding what it means to be a follower of Christ?” If they’re all talking about Jesus, why does the Jesus they’re talking about look different in different churches?

 This was similar to the question posed to us by a young man who had
 been raised by evangelical missionary parents but who had converted in the
 Eastern Orthodox church in California. While he took issue with a number of
 hundred-year message and liturgy to the multiplicity of Protestant versions.
 “With all the evangelicals telling me they were ‘just preaching Jesus’ I became
 confused when they were all preaching different Jesuses,” he complained.
 In They Like Jesus but Not the Church, Dan Kimball fires a similar shot

 across the church’s bow. By interviewing a number of unchurched young
 about faith in Jesus, his focus group was open to such faith but skeptical that
 the church is an organized religion with a political agenda, is negative and
 fundamentalist.2
 Kimball describes going onto a university campus with a video camera

 to interview students about their attitudes to the Christian faith. Instead of
 lieve there is only one way to God? If you were to die tonight...”), Kimball
 “What comes to mind when you hear the word Christian?” The responses

 turned them into dogmatic rules

 that Jesus gave

 In summing up their attitudes, Kimball quotes Gandhi’s dictum: “I like
 your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your
 Christ.”
 As should be obvious by now, we believe that Christian faith must look

 to Jesus and must be well founded on him if it is to be authentic. If NASA was
 moon by thousands of miles. And in many ways this is the same as it applies
 identity, ministry, and mission, we believe it is critical to get this right and to
 place. But these shifts are usually inadvertent and take place incrementally
 core of the faith. Whatever the process, it results in an insidious change in

 Therefore we propose that church should be recalibrated around its
 founder, Jesus. But what would that look like? Jesus didn’t found any churches.

He unleashed an army of little Jesuses who went forth and founded faith communities across the known world. But Jesus fashioned a temporary community, or a proto-church, if you will. Within the DNA of his itinerant community of disciples there exists the stuff of church, but it’s not until we get to the apostle Paul that we see what it looks like to embody that DNA in a more stable, indigenous faith community. Paul takes the example of Jesus and, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, unfurls those priorities and values into what we today call biblical ecclesiology.

 Here is a curious question that will highlight the issue for us: If the church
 had only the four Gospels to go by, what would it look like? Certainly discipleship would be emphasized, as would the prominence on living in and under
 lifestyle and adventuresome community with lots of love, faithfulness, mercy,
 anity? Now again, this somewhat tongue-in-cheek question is not meant to
 tleship in the church (God forbid), but as a mental exercise it should highlight
 focus on Jesus. Indeed, what we see Paul doing, in his epistles in particular,
 provided by Jesus in the example of his community. It’s a relief that we are not
 the New Testament to help us see the fullness of all that a community of Jesus’
 Jesus’ example and Paul’s ecclesiology. One is the outworking of the other. But
 in our time is dependent on the renewal of the gospel. And the renewal of the
 must re Jesus our theology as well as our churches.
 Paul’s Vision of the Jesus Community

 Let’s take some time to explore Paul’s ecclesiology and hold it up
 against the lens of Jesus’ example from the Gospels. In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul addresses a number of what we might call generic church issues.

Unlike his correspondence to the Corinthians or the Galatians, which specifically addresses particular issues with which each church was struggling, the letter to the Ephesians includes a lot of material applicable to all churches everywhere. This is probably because it was a circular letter that was sent around to various churches in Asia Minor.

 According to his Ephesian correspondence, Paul saw the notion of ecclesia being anchored on the foundation of a series of core truths.

 Jesus Is “Head over All Things for the Church” (Eph 1:22)

Here we have an intriguing phrase regarding Jesus’ pre-eminence. After noting that God has placed everything under the feet of Jesus, Paul then says that Jesus has been appointed head over everything for the church. That Jesus is head over all things is clear enough, but what did Paul mean by the phrase “for the church”? It seems that Paul is saying that Jesus exercises his supreme global authority over all things in the interest of the church. That is, the rule of Jesus is for the benefit of his church. It can sound arrogant of the church to suggest such a thing, as though Jesus rules in favor of Christians over all other people. Some church leaders have spoken this way to suggest that Jesus endorses them no matter what. However, a quick read of the seven letters to the seven churches found in thebook of Revelation will show that Jesus doesn’t mind standing against the church at times. It seems that what Paul is saying is that the future of Jesus’ pre-eminent reign is inextricably linked with the future of the church. He has the church’s interest at heart.

 The Church “Is His Body” (Eph 1:23)
 Paul makes much more of this metaphor in 1 Corinthians. Here, he is

 happy simply to introduce the idea. The church is the body of Jesus. It is
 and connectedness between Jesus and his followers. In Eph 4, Paul uses the

And in 1 Cor 12, he expands it to discuss the diversity of gifts expressed by the followers of Jesus working together in harmony. The overall idea is one of teamwork, partnership, trust, respect, and intimacy. In both our previous books, we discuss the idea of communitas, the intimacy and devotion that develop between a group of people when faced with a common task or ordeal.

Paul suggests as much in his use of body imagery in his letters.

 The Church Is “the Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All” (Eph 1:23)
 Now here is a big concept of the church—hardly a reduced idea of what

 Jesus intended! In the previous chapter we explored the centrality of the shema
 life in every sphere. Here, Paul is identifying Jesus with such a rule by saying
 Jesus’ omnipresence and sovereignty. But note how he refers to the church as
 his fullness. In a sense Paul is saying, for example, “Look at the mountains
 want to see the fullness of his presence, look at the church!” Now, often when
 the institution of the church: “Look at our buildings and our church services!

There you will see the fullness of Christ!” This isn’t what Paul meant. There were no flashy church services to look at, and very few churches had their own buildings. Paul is saying that in the organic, messy, often troubled, sometimes harmonious webs of relationship found among Jesus’ followers you can see the richness and beauty and power of the fullness of Jesus.

 The Church Is Part of God’s “Eternal Purpose” (Eph 3:10–11)
 In this beautiful section of Eph 3, Paul declares that God has made his

 wisdom known in the heavenly realms through the church:
 Through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known
 to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the

 Now that’s saying something! It implies that throughout the ages God’s
 manifold wisdom could never be quite appreciated by the heavenly community, because it seems that God doesn’t have a true relationship with the rulers
 lationship God reserves himself for with humankind. It wasn’t until the church
 through Jesus that the richness of God’s wisdom could be appreciated. ThereDo we need a greater demonstration that God’s wisdom is intrinsically relational than this? God’s wisdom is not merely a matter of superior cognition or greater accumulated knowledge. The wisdom of God is displayed through the webs of relationships of Jesus’ followers. In Jas 3:17, a similar idea is presented: “the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of impartiality or hypocrisy.”

 If the wisdom of God is all these things—essentially relational things—
 then God is able to fully express such wisdom only through relationship with
 his people. This was God’s plan, says Paul, throughout eternity. The followers

 over the recipients of his letter (and yet he still has three more chapters up

 Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abunand in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen. (Eph 3:20–21)
 Certainly God is worthy of all glory, and Paul identifies two sources of his glory: his son, Jesus, and the church.

 “Christ Is the Head of the Church, the Body of Which He Is the Savior”

 Paul returns to the body metaphor again, if only briefly, to re-emphasize
 Jesus’ rule over his followers and to make explicit that he is its Savior as well.

Having saved the church, he can then be its head or ruler. But this is not simply a matter of ownership. This text appears in the midst of a discussion about the relationship between husbands and wives. Jesus is the head and the savior of the church, but this is expressed in distinctly relational terms.

 Jesus “Loved the Church and Gave Himself up for Her” (Eph 5:25)
 Jesus loves his church, just as a good husband is to love his wife. His

 death on the cross is his supreme act of devotion and love.
 Jesus’ Design Is to Present It as a Holy, Blameless Church (Eph 5:26–27)
 Paul has told us what Jesus has done for his church in a past sense: he
 has loved the church, saved the church, and rules the church. Now he turns
 his attention to the future and announces that the church is a work in progimage. Jesus’ future design for his followers is to
 make her holy by cleansing her with the washing with water by the word, so as to
 present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything

 Jesus Nourishes and Cares for the Church (Eph 5:29–30)
 Says Paul, “No one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, because we are members
 dicates that as part of his future orientation in presenting the church blameand attending to its concerns. It seems to us that Jesus is more than involved

## If This Is Church, We Want In

 And so, whatever the church is, we want to a part of it! We think that its
 true reality is far more than the religious institution it became. It is an intimate network of Jesus followers. It is saturated with Jesus.
 Paul’s favorite image for the church is that of a family, or to be more accurate, the household.4 If you did a word search through his letters, you would

 These eight action points don’t require any significant collateral or specially
 devoted to following Jesus, and they can be lived out in the ordinary world.
 Getting Back to Jesus’ Community

 So far so good. But remember we have derived these points from
 Paul’s words in Ephesians. Would Jesus agree with what Paul wrote in Ephesians? There’s no doubt that Paul anchors the church steadfastly to the
 that looks like this? Let’s turn our attention back to the Gospels to find out.

We will take the eight action points listed above and check them against the example of Jesus.

 Jesus’ Community Will Follow the Example of Jesus
 As implied in the early sections of this book, our point is that we don’t

 want Presbyterians to look more like John Knox or Methodists to look more
 believers to look more like Jesus. We don’t discount the enormous contribuwe recognize that there’s much we can learn from such leaders, but let Jesus

 whose innovative take on Hebrew philosophy they had come to appreciate.

He does more than conduct outdoor theology classes. He models an alternate lifestyle. He models itinerancy (Luke 9:57–62) and complete trust in the provision of God (Luke 12:22–31). He demonstrates how to treat children (Luke 18:15–17) and women (Luke 8:1–3; 10:38–42). He provides a template for how they are to pray (Luke 11:1–2). He sends them out to duplicate his ministry of healing and preaching (Luke 9:1–6). He allows them to question him on his parables (Luke 8:9). Some of them witness his transfiguration (Luke 9:28–29); all of them witness his resurrection (Luke 24:36–37).

 This was the beginning of the conspiracy of the little Jesus. He replicates himself in the lives of his first followers. He allowed them to make
 an intensive study of his life and ministry and then unleashed them on an

 Jesus’ Community Will Equip All Followers

 The examples of the de-emphasizing the Sabbath in Jesus’ life and ministry are many. In Luke 14 we read,
 On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the Sabbath, they were watching him closely. Just then,
 and Pharisees, “Is it lawful to cure people on the sabbath, or not?” But they
 said to them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that has fallen into a well, will
 to this. (Luke 14:1–6)
 Jesus was picking up on a scholarly debate of the time. It had been a

 topic of much discussion by Jewish scholars as to whether it was lawful to
 ful to save an ox but legal to save your own son. Such debates always occur in
 a watery well. Jesus throws their scholarly disconnection back in their faces.

Before them lay a man who could not walk. Without work, he would have been starving to death, reduced to begging for scraps and alms. Knowing that their answer about the legalities of Sabbath keeping would directly bear on the livelihood of this poor soul, the Pharisees are silenced by their embarrassment. Jesus, though, is a man of action. He is a man of engagement and decisiveness. Sabbath or no Sabbath, the beggar needed his touch, and he refused to stand idly by, paralyzed by theological niceties.

 How amazing that the religion that bears his name has become every
 bit as Sabbath-centric as Jesus’ opponents! So much of the Christian church
 focuses on getting people into the pews on a Sunday morning as its highest
 dance instead of as communion with God in every area of their week and life.

It has shifted its preference to Sunday, but it is no less paralyzed by the legalism that silenced the Pharisees. How could we have missed Jesus’ words in Luke 6, where after the Pharisees rebuked his disciples for eating the kernels of grain on the Sabbath, he snapped,

 “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hunence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his
 (Luke 6:3–5)
 Jesus is locating himself as the center of the religious cult of Judaism.

As we’ve seen, he sees himself as the physical embodiment of the temple. He does what a temple is supposed to do. Now, he proclaims lordship over the Sabbath. It is his day now. He was not shifting the focus of Sabbath keeping from Yahweh to himself. He is Yahweh! It was always his day. What he is doing is declaring lordship over all of life, including the Sabbath. In Mark’s version of the same episode, Jesus says, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath” (Mark 2:27). His point was that the Sabbath was made to serve people, instead of people being created to serve the Sabbath. The Sabbath was a servant, not a master. He was telling them that they should apply the law of the Sabbath with mercy and thought to human need.

And he was telling them he had the authority to define how they should observe the Sabbath. In short, human need (the disciples’ hunger, the ill man’s dropsy) is more important than blind Sabbath keeping.

 Jesus sets his friends free to enjoy snacking on the rolled husks of
 wheat. He attends to an ill man rather than be bound by legalism. Likewise,
 the church today must rediscover that while regular times of retreat and rea friend who works in a downtown office in Sydney who takes his lunch two

 Jesus’ Community Will Move Outward to Serve Others
 Jesus’ community is not a static band of learners. They are a moving,

 living, breathing, organic team of little Jesuses. Far from setting up camp
 rhetoric, Jesus hits the road with his followers, showing that community is
 selves. They are buffeted by criticism from opponents, confused by the re-

 To be sure, there are examples of occasional or casual observers enjoying the ministry of Jesus. At the Sermon on the Mount and the feeding
 of the thousands, Jesus attracted large audiences. However, John points out
 feeding of five thousand, many turned away, offended by his uncompromising

 (John 6:68).
 How can churches today resist the pull to become a spectator sport?

How can they fight against, instead of be caught up by, the spirit of consumerism? Churches wanting to grow sometimes end up desperately trying to attract a greater share of the market with advertising ploys and promises of greater luxury and better religious goods and services. We heard of a church in California that gives away a Harley-Davidson motorbike each year to the person who brings the most visitors to church on Sundays. Is this the way Jesus mobilized his followers? By appealing to their greed and self-interest?

Jesus fashioned a community of devoted, selfless servants who had sought to model their lives on his selflessness and service. And in so doing they became bound to each in the bonds of a common cause.

 pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in
 ing, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they
 knows what you need before you ask him.” (Matt 6:5–8)
 Personal prayer, solitude, and retreat are an intrinsic part of Jesus’ community. In fact, Jesus models them as an essential part of his devotional life:
 in the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted
 place, and there he prayed. (Mark 1:35)
 But he would withdraw to deserted places and pray. (Luke 5:16)

 Even at the lowest point of his life, in the Garden of Gethsemane, he
 withdraws from the others to pray. In fact, if we take his words to his community in Matthew 6 seriously, his preference is that prayer not be a showy disa disciple and his or her heavenly Father.
 The question about fasting needs to be addressed as well, because it

 to remind you that Jesus wasn’t all that nice. He was good. He was loving. He

 thing in the media or not is beside the point. But the point is that somehow
 larly and scathingly critical of the religious leaders of his faith community.

Furthermore, Jesus’ seven messages to the seven churches in thebook of Revelation (Rev 2:1–3:22) contain plenty of harshly critical comment directed at the church! To claim it is un-Christlike to criticize the church is to disregard the example of Jesus.

 It seems to us that this is the exemplifying of politeness, courtesy, and
 niceness over the values taught by Jesus. We cannot boil his radical new vision for the kingdom of God down to an expression of conventionality and
 Jesus and his followers in hot water on more than one occasion. And so what

 When Paul calls us to be a holy community, “without a spot or wrinkle

 or anything of the kind... holy and blameless” (Eph 5:26–27), he is not rebehalf. We cannot earn Jesus’ love by politeness or niceness. It is offered

 Therefore as I conclude this study, I find it necessary to confront what appears
 “For God so loved the world...” would have puzzled an educated pagan. And the

 to be merciful.... This was revolutionary stuff. Indeed, it was the cultural basis

 It is by our love that all people might know that we are Jesus’ disciples.

Any community of faith characterized by his name must be a community of peace, love, mercy, and freedom. Stark continues by exploring the ways this was manifest in the early period of the Christian era:

 In my judgment, a major way in which Christianity served as a revitalization

 brothers in Christ. Finally, what Christianity gave to its converts was nothing

 When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue,
 or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. If anyone speaks

 the others weigh what is said. If a revelation is made to someone else sitting
 that all may learn and all be encouraged. (1 Cor 14:26–31)
 Here is a picture of the church cooperating seamlessly with the Holy

 Spirit and each other, each playing their part, each making their contribution.

What is one of the ways Jesus nourishes and cares for us? Via the other members of our faith community.

 An example of someone who takes this seriously is Dan Kimball from
 Vintage Faith Church in Santa Cruz, to whom we referred earlier. He has developed a series of questions he asks of all his worship leaders as a regular
 munity. Those questions are

1. Does our worship lift up Jesus as the center of our church

 community?

2. In our worship gathering, are the Scriptures read and taught as the

 normative wisdom for our church community?

3. When we gather to worship, is prayer an essential part of what we do?

4. Do our worship gatherings provide opportunities for us to express

 our togetherness as a community?

5. Is the communion meal a regular or central part of our worship?

6. Are the members of our church reminded of their obligations to live

 missional lives when they gather for worship?

7. Does the arrangement of our worship meeting allow for anyone or

 everyone to contribute to the whole as they see fit and according to

 We wish all worship curators, rectors, ministers, and pastors were asked these questions more regularly.

 In the world to come, we will still be charged with the task of declaring Jesus’ rule over all of life. Paul was intentionally seeking to replicate the
 model laid down by Jesus. It was as if he was taking the original Jesus comdifficulty with the church today is that we are trying to make faded copies of

 At the beginning of this book, we shared about our visits to the great cathedrals of Rome and Moscow, and we asked how far has the religious institution of church moved from the dynamic, relational, countercultural collective

 the mainstream church. We are not proposing some radical new ecclesiologidoing church. We are calling faith communities of Jesus followers to rediswith contempt or disregard for the traditions developed by Christians over
 these matters. But we can hold up the models of church we find around us
 in the Gospels and the New Testament, and we can ask some serious quesaround the person of Jesus rather than around marketing ploys developed for

4. There is a world of difference as to how we tend to interpret the word

“family” and what the Bible means by “household.” We tend to impose the nuclear idea of family on the Scriptures, but the Bible’s idea of family is much broader and more inclusive.

 This Bit Last
 There is no Gospel at all if Christ be not God. It is no

 news to me to tell me that a great prophet is born.

There have been great prophets before; but the world has never been redeemed from evil by mere testimony to the truth, and it never will be. But tell me that God is born, that God Himself has espoused our nature, and taken it into union with Himself, then the bells of my heart ring merry peals, for now may I come to God since God has come to me.

 —C. H. Spurgeon
