# SERIES EDITOR'S PREFACE

There is little doubt something fundamental is going on when it comes to our thinking about church in relation to the contexts in which we find ourselves. Right Here, Right Now is a book for these times. Its publication coincides with a number of significant books, events, and manifestos that highlight the paradigm shift taking place in our day—what is generally called the missional church movement.

But the truth is that most of these defining events and texts remain largely a church leadership affair—and a pretty highfalutin one at that. The weighty ideas of the missional church movement and, beyond this, the sheer power it represents for the wholesale renewal of Christianity in our time and place remains largely incomprehensible to the masses of people who don’t have the time and training to engage these world-changing ideas at the more technical level.

Right Here, Right Now is a book designed to remedy this situation and thereby make missional church what it should be: a movement of the whole people of God in every sphere and domain of society. While Lance and I only glance at issues relating specifically to church and church planting here, we are dedicated to helping the average believer become an effective agent of the King wherever they might find themselves. Without meaning this in any derogatory sense, this is in effect a missionality-for-dummies typebook—missionality for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Hopefully you will find it accessible, challenging, intriguing, and motivational all at once.

This fits well with what the Baker-Shapevine series seeks to do: to provide a forum for all of God’s redeemed people to engage with world-changing ideas. It compliments our previous publications by authors Neil Cole (Organic Leadership), Debra and Alan Hirsch (Untamed), and Tri Robinson (Rooted in Good Soil)—all accessible, missional, and challenging reads.

And it is with this sense of trying to serve the cause of Jesus and his church that we entrust this book to your critical engagement.
