# Chapter 1: Putting the Extra in the Ordinary

Viewing Daily Life with a Missionary’s Eye

> Here's the church
> Here's the steeple
> Open the doors
> And there's all the people

In the words of Dana Carvey's Church Lady, "Isn't that special?" Well, no, it’s really not. Call me a theological prude, but I think it is pretty awful. But just about anyone that grew up in church will recognize this little children’s rhyme.

And at first glance it seems cute and innocent enough, but it reinforces, at an early and impressionable age, the skewed viewpoint that church is a building and it is the primary place where the people of God are to be found.

In our day, we are seeing this edifice-complex idea of the church begin to erode. More and more, we are seeing instances of pastors and church leaders chipping away at the wrongheaded idea of church as an event or location. Leaders are helping their congregations to understand and confidently embrace the call to ministry that God has placed on their lives. Christians everywhere are beginning to see their callings are just as relevant, substantial, and certifiable as any “professional” ministry position.

Me, a Missionary?

Have you ever heard this song? Like any good comedic piece, it’s a fun parody because it echoes a lot of truth about our ideas—in this case, of the call to a missionary life:

> Oh Lord, I am your willing servant; You know that I have been for years
> I’m here in this pew every Sunday and Wednesday,
> I’ve stained it with many a tear,
> my best
> So, Lord, I deserve this request
> Please don’t send me to Africa, I don’t think I’ve got what it takes

> I’m just a man, I’m not a Tarzan,
> I’ll serve you here in suburbia,
> But please don’t send me out into the bush,
> I’ll see that the money is gathered, I’ll see that the money is sent
> I’ll tithe eleven percent
> I'll go on the youth group retreat I'll usher, I'll deacon, I'll go door to door,
> —Scott Wesley Brown,
> Used by permission.

The first time I heard this song I thought, “This guy must have grown up in my church.” My idea of a missionary was fueled by summer visits to our church from missionary families. This was the time of year that the missionary families were “on furlough,” which even as a youngster sounded to me like a temporary break from army duty. They would give Kodak slide presentations of their work when they visited the churches that funded them. I would count ceiling tiles as the projector clicked off one picture after another. I wanted to hear stories about tiger attacks and dodging poison darts.

As a youngster all the presentations seemed to depict a white family living amidst tribal people in Papua New Guinea or Nairobi, or working with little Australian Aborigines. I wondered what these poor Americans had done to make God mad enough to send them to such places. To me, missionary life meant no Pop-Tarts for breakfast, no Fleetwood Mac eight tracks, and no Dallas Cowboys on Sunday afternoons.

In the fellowship hall after one of these presentations, I told one of my friends, “I’ll never be a missionary. I’m gonna ask God to never send me to one of those places.” One of the old ladies in our church overheard what I said, shook a nine-inch finger in my face and said, “You better not say that, young man, because if you do, that’s exactly where God will send you!” I looked at her bug-eyed, and gulped. I thought to myself, “I’ve done it now. Ten years old, and my life is done for.” That pretty much summed up my concept of missions. As I grew older, I admired the missionaries and felt an allegiance to support them financially, but I did not see myself in any way, shape, or form as a missionary. In my mind, missions were something that happened across borders, in faraway places. To be a missionary you had to move to a foreign land. I certainly didn’t feel called to move to any particular faraway place or people, so I knew for sure I wasn’t called to be a missionary. From that point on, when I heard the word “missionary,” there was an immediate mental disconnect between that word and me.

## Missionary in the Mirror

Through many years and conversations with other Christians and church leaders, I came to realize that my concept of a missionary was pretty much the norm. Most of us have viewed missions as something that happens over there. “We have tended to see mission as something we do in ‘heathen nations’ and not on home base. We evangelize here and do mission there.

This has rightly been called the ‘geographic myth.’ ”1 The reality is that all Christians are not only called to be missionaries but have already been sent to the people they are called to reach. Christians who earn a living as teachers, accountants, store clerks, mechanics, plumbers, doctors, whatever—you are a missionary! This is not to cheapen the definition of a missionary. I’m not suggesting that there are not certain members of the body of Christ who are called by the Lord to serve in locations that necessitate relocating and learning native languages and customs. There absolutely are.

Many of these Christians are my personal heroes.

What has been missing, however, is a broader understanding and imagination of who is both qualified and conscribed to missions. Every Christian needs to view his or her immediate world with the same perspective as a missionary in a foreign land.

The best hope for the spread of kingdom outposts is for our churches to consist of individuals who view themselves as missionaries. Amissionary sees the immediate world with different POSTSCRIPT eyes than does the native citizen. by Alan Hirsch If you have ever participated in a short-term mission trip, you have a taste of what this feels like.

But if inmissionary movement. dividual members are not committed to living their lives as kingdom-minded missionaries in their daily life stations, then the corporate efforts of the church as a whole will never sniff the air of their true kingdom potential.

It is impossible to be a missional church if we fail to be missional people. Otherwise, missionality is reduced to sponsored programs that centralize the life of the body of Christ, institutionalizing and containing it in church systems and programs that view mission as something that happens “over there” or at special events.

One evening I was driving home from a planning meeting at our church offices where we had just scheduled a servantkindness project. By that point we had done dozens of such projects, but this time something hit me as strange and unnatural about this. It just felt somewhat contrived and artificial. I had to admit to myself that I was about 50 percent friendlier to strangers during these special events than I was the rest of the time. I realized I was clocking in for the “good works” hour and clocking out when it was over. I thought to myself, “Rather than training our people to do kindness and generosity for a couple of hours, why don’t we train them to be kind and generous... all the time?” Serving events can be great primers and training camps for developing and sharpening the missional heart, but these alone will fail to develop full-fledged missional movements in our fellowships. Churches that organize themselves in a missional orientation view mission as something that happens right here and right now through all members of the church all of the time. There is a huge difference in a church organizing itself around church services, sermons, and great worship events over and against a church that takes up its position and mandate as a missionary for its culture. This has nothing to do with church size—mega, medium, or small church.

My good friend Bob Roberts and his wife saw their church (Northwood Church in Keller, TX) totally transformed several years ago. In the midst of lamenting that their desire to work in a foreign mission field was not going to happen, he had a life-altering thought: “What if the church viewed itself as a missionary?” In other words, rather than just looking for people who could be sent to a foreign field, what might happen if a local church began to view itself as a missionary in its local setting? Bob began to ask, “What would be the effect if a local church began to train its members to live with the same fervor, goals, and mindset of a missionary who had been sent to a foreign field? Plus, what would happen if that same church also went to foreign fields as well and committed itself to POSTSCRIPT entire people groups, pouring its by Alan Hirsch combined talents and resources into transformative synergy?” The results have been nothing Aworking definition of missional short of phenomenal—significhurch is a community of God’s cant transformation has been people that defines itself by, and made in several foreign nations, organizes its life around, its real plus “average” church members purpose of being an agent of literally live for mission, realignGod’s mission to the world.

They give themselves to community of faith that adheres to learn the culture and traditions Jesus. To obstruct this is to block of these people groups, mixing God’s purposes in and through his their lives with them. They are a people. glocal (global + local) missional people.

Does this mean the church Bob serves does not have a wellorganized Sunday morning experience? Not at all. Northwood is a megachurch, with all the accompanying bells and whistles, and energetic, uplifting church services. But the lifeblood of Northwood Church flows from its missionary character. If you aren’t keen on mission or just want feel-good messages, you will not stay there long. Bob and his team will drive you nuts to get on mission.

Mission as organizing principle means that mission goes way beyond being some sort of optional activity or program for our churches. It actually is the organizing axis of the church. The life of the church revolves around it. This is not to say that we don’t do corporate worship, develop community, and make disciples, but that these are catalyzed by and organized around the mission function. Only in this way can we be truly missional. Merely adding serving events or special outreach days to our church schedules will not develop missional people nor make a missional church.

## No Average Joes

It is essential for the average Joe and Jill Churchperson to cease viewing themselves as average. Leaders must also stop viewing them this way as well. There is nothing remotely average about a human being who has been born again with the very resurrection life that caused Jesus to rise from the dead (see Eph. 2:3–10), to have the indwelling Holy Spirit as guide, to possess the mind of Christ for needed wisdom, and then to be commissioned by Jesus himself to go into the world with his redemptive agenda.

It is an affront to the person and work of Jesus for any Christian to view himself or herself as a mere church member. I don’t say this in order to patronize and pump up the injured or unhealthy self-esteem of some readers. The facts and outcome of redemption through the blood of Jesus is that the very life and power of Jesus is in every Christian. We are all equipped to minister right here and right now, regardless of what that “here and now” is. Consider the words of the apostle Paul: “And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work” (2 Cor. 9:8).

God is not limited. To the contrary, he is able to make his grace fill up anything lacking in us. Paul says that not only will we have all that we need, we will abound in every good work. For a group of Christians, regardless of size, to take on this understanding and perspective is a powerful thing to consider. The potential for real community transformation is enormous when “average” Christians pick up the mantle of servanthood. It happens as we take upon ourselves the responsibility to see that those we encounter on a day-today basis are blessed, and we take seriously our own roles as ambassadors of the kingdom of God.

This means we don’t place the responsibility for outreach events on the church staff. When we realize this and act on it, the number of those involved in “ministry” increases exponentially. All the while Christian living moves from living safe and secure (even boring) lives to a life of solid purpose and engagement in the adventure of advancing the kingdom agenda of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It really changes everything about our lives and pursuits.

Recently a suburban mother of three decided to take seriously Jesus’ words about inviting strangers and outcasts to approached, Colleen Norton chose to reach out to others by placing a simple ad on Craigslist that read: Free Christmas Dinner With New Friends Are you hitting hard times or lonely and want to have a nice Christmas dinner? Please come and celebrate with my loving family. Please email for my address. Thank you and God Bless.

Thirty people responded to Colleen’s ad, many wanting to donate food, and six (previously) strangers, including a mother and her two sons, joined Colleen’s family for Christmas dinner. One lady said she responded to the ad because her husband was in the hospital recovering from a stroke and she had no one to spend Christmas day with. Colleen said she hopes to teach her three daughters the importance of helping others and that Christmas is POSTSCRIPT about reaching out to others. “I like to believe that my girls learn by Alan Hirsch that they’re really blessed in life,” she said. “If we were hitting hard If we will just allow our times, we would hope that someimaginations to be handed over one would be there for us.” to God, missional creativity and

It happens as ministry imagination in life is to produce, moves out of the church box and out of the society we have to live into the landscape of everyday in, a vision of the society we want life. It is misguided to say, “I’m to live in.”2 in full-time ministry,” implying that Christians who don’t get their paycheck from a church or Christian organization are only in part-time ministry. We might as well be saying, “I’m a pro; you’re just an amateur.” The Jesus edict couldn’t be clearer. He calls all Christians as full-time ambassadors of his kingdom, regardless of vocation or the way they earn their living. As he prays to the Father, shortly before betrayal and crucifixion, Jesus underscores the missional commissioning of his disciples: “In the same way that you gave me a mission in the world, I give them a mission in the world” (John 17:18 Message).

Jesus says, “My disciples are sent on mission, just like I was sent on mission.” To be like Jesus means we not only embrace his character and message, but we embrace his mission as well.

## Want Joy? I’ll Give You Joy

This calling and sending action not only forms our identity as the people of God, but it is tied directly to our purpose for life. Joy and contentment are direct by-products of being and doing who and what we are called by God to both be and do. When most of our energy and resources are spent on things other than our God-given purpose and call, we become drained and hollow. We become like caged birds, with clipped wings. Birds were not created to be in cages but were meant to take flight. But as we open our eyes to the hurts and needs around us, and we make our time and resources available to God and others, our hearts grow and our lives are filled with true joy. Sending us on mission is one of the greatest gifts God could give us. Something almost mystical takes place when we reach out to others to help and heal them. Jesus mentions the joy factor in the John 17 prayer, just a few sentences before the verse we just read: “I’m saying these things in the world’s hearing so my people can experience my joy completed in them” (John 17:13 Message).

Many psychologists conclude that the majority of emotional and spiritual disorders are not the result of damaged psyches but of disconnected people. The premise is that when two people connect on a significant level, something is poured out of one into the other that has the power to heal the soul of its deepest wounds and create restoration. We are wired by God to both need and be needed by others. Over two decades of pastoring has taught me that the people who refuse to help others are the ones who remain most needy themselves. On the other hand, some of the most joyful people I’ve known have been the most selfless, although their own circumstances were hard or less than ideal.

Perhaps the greatest factor that hinders the Western church from missional engagement is that most Christians here do not identify themselves as fully empowered agents of the kingdom of God. Most Christians have allowed their identity and life purpose to be shaped by the surrounding culture.

This leaves God’s agenda—the agenda of his kingdom— languishing. The mission of God gets people’s leftovers. The remaining scraps from earthly pursuits are tossed God’s way.

The Times, They Are A-Changinged For the North American church, a major game-changer has come about over the last half century. As the final decades of the twentieth century progressed, the door began to close on the church as having a privileged position in contemporary society. There are many signs of this. In the Midwest and South (in the US) prior to the late 1980s, you would never see children’s sports leagues schedule games on Sundays. I know by experience, growing up in Texas in the 1970s, Little League baseball games and even practices would never take place on Wednesdays because of the influence of evangelicals and church services on Wednesday nights. Youth event organizers and public school officials would not think of scheduling events late in the day on Wednesday in deference to local churches.

Statistically speaking, church attendance began to slide at an enormous rate, and Sunday, for instance, lost its place as a sacred day in North America. Blue laws (statutes that prohibited many products from being sold on Sundays) left the books, and department stores and other businesses started opening their doors on Sundays. This signaled the final chapter on the age of Constantinian4 Christendom, where the church stood front and center, influence-wise, in communities. Author and editor Rodney Clapp says: Christians feel useless because the church feels useless. And the church feels useless because it keeps on trying to perform Constantinian duties in a world that is no longer Constantinian. So the grace is this: Christians feel useless because they are no longer useful for the wrong thing, namely serving as chaplains in a sponsorial religion.5

I remember my (public) elementary school days in the early 1970s. Each morning began with the principal praying over an intercom as each classroom stood at attention, with hand over heart. The Ten Commandments hung in each classroom and there was no concern of lawsuits or Supreme Court intervention.

These were times when Christianity was supported and reinforced through many entities such as education and political and civic organizations. Many Christians lament the passing of these days, believing that the church is to occupy a dominative position and create a Christian nation-state. The present situation has left many in the POSTSCRIPT church confused and frustrated.

The problem for many more institutional “idea of church” Christians and church leaders is than that of our early forebears. that we have not come to grips And not all of it is bad. But what with this fact. We fight for prayers has been highly damaging is the and the Ten Commandments to present-day way of being and doing stay posted in courtrooms bechurch that arose from it becoming cause we think Christianity is the official, state-sponsored the dominant civil religion and religion. As a result, mission was ought to be so. In other words, trivialized to being a marginal, we still think of the church and undeveloped, unloved subset of its mission in terms of Christenthe church rather than being its dom, while in reality we are in a organizing principle. This has post-Christendom context. The distorted our sense of identity and Western church still operates for our purpose as God’s people from the most part in a Christendom being a dynamic, transformative mode. People who fail to come to grips with the end of Chrismovement to being a static, tendom remind me of the legreligious institution ends of Japanese soldiers holed up for several years in tunnels on the island of I owa Jima. They refused to believe that World War II was over. They eventually had to come out and learn to live in a post-war culture.

Alan and I believe that the end of Christendom is not bad news. To the contrary, it is forcing us all to dig deeply to reimagine and reconsider the purpose and position of the church. It is causing massive numbers of Christians to awaken to something dormant in their lives. They are coming to realize that their calling is every bit as genuine and relevant as seminary-trained professional clergy.

No longer should any of us expect to be able to set up a church in the midst of a community and have the “build it and they will come” Field of Dreams phenomena take place. Rather, we must develop pockets of believers embedded throughout the community that draw life from the well of redemption and see their own lives as available way stations for thirsty travelers.

Where Are You From, Partner?

One evening Alan and I were eating at one of those Texasthemed steak houses, and the servers were singing a chorus that refrained with the phrase, “Yee haw!” With a smirk, Alan said to me, “You Texans... Yee haw!” I said, “You Aussies... By crickey!” This created a spirited argument where I felt obliged to defend the Texan motherland. I argued that this saying is nothing more than an old-time B-Western movie phrase that has nothing to do with modern-day Texans. “Texans don’t go around saying, ‘Yee haw,’ ” I told him. I also made the point that most Texans don’t ride horses, wear cowboy hats, or have spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle. Alan tried to convince me that “by crickey” was not a phrase used by the typical Aussie, nor do most of them run around with horse whips tied to their belts and hunting knifes slid into their boots. The fact is, we all expect people from certain places to speak, dress, and pursue a certain set of styles, ideas, and agendas. We expect people loyal to their homeland to buy into and live by the values and goals of their citizenry.

I point this all things, and yet abound in all; they out because of the undeniable are dishonoured, and yet in their very fact that the vast majority of dishonour are glorified.6 Christians and Christian leaders emphasize church but give scant attention to the kingdom of God and disciple making. We are pretty much obsessed with church but only favorable toward the kingdom of God.

The word kingdom, as used in the New Testament, is the Greek word basileia. It connotes the idea of both the manifestation of and the coming reign of God’s rule. It entails all that can come about when and where God is ruling. The kingdom of God is the ethic and creed from which Jesus drew and lived out his life. It set the beat for his rhythm of living.

As Jesus went about his public ministry, he announced the coming kingdom and gave foretastes of what the full reign of God would eventually entail. He issued an Invitation for people to come into the kingdom and to learn a new approach to life in light of the kingdom agenda and heavenly purposes.

Dallas Willard speaks to this: From the very beginning of his work, those who relied on him had, at his touch, entered the rule, or governance, of God and were receiving its gracious sufficiency. Jesus was not just acting for God but also with God—a little like the way, in a crude metaphor, I act with my power steering, or it with me, when I turn the wheel of my car. And this “governance” is projected onward through those who receive him. When we receive God’s gift of life by relying on Christ, we find that God comes to act with us as we rely on him in our actions. That explains why Jesus said that the least in the kingdom of the heavens are greater than John the Baptist—not, of course, greater in themselves, but as a greater power works along with them. The “greater” is not inherent, a matter of our own substance, but relational. So, C. S. Lewis writes, our faith is not a matter of our hearing what Christ said long ago and “trying to carry it out.” Rather, “The real Son of God is at your side. He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself.

He is beginning, so to speak, to ‘inject’ His kind of life and thought, His Zoe [life], into you; beginning to turn the tin soldier into a live man. The part of you that does not like it is the part that is still tin.”7 Have You Given Your Life to the Lord?

Living from and toward the advancing kingdom of God means we need to continually audit our lives in light of the priorities and agenda of Jesus himself. Such an approach sets us at odds with many of the pursuits, goals, and pressures of contemporary society. Most Christians are willing to give their afterlife to Jesus but want to keep their earthly life for themselves. “Sure, Lord, you can have me when I’m dead, but I want to hold on to the reigns of this earthly gig.” There is a commonly spoken phrase used by evangelicals regarding someone who has recently turned to the Lord, and I do not want to be overly critical here, but when I hear someone say, “Five people gave their lives to the Lord in our meeting last night,” I bristle. I want to ask, “How do you know they gave their lives to the Lord?” You can’t know that until some degree of time goes by. As Benjamin Franklin said, “Time is the stuff life is made of.” We must watch a person’s life to know whether or not they have really surrendered it to the Lord.

When Jesus announced the arrival of the kingdom of God he said, “Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.” Notice, he did not say, “Adjust.” To repent entails a complete turnaround. It means that our entire life is aimed in a new direction, with new goals and pursuits. If I am driving west on a highway and receive a phone call that instructs me to change my destination to a city that is to the east of my present location, I cannot merely adjust my heading. I must “repent”—turn around. I must take the next available exit and go in a completely different direction.

GPS systems are great for driving in unfamiliar territory.

You enter the destination address, the system determines the best route, and off you go. If you divert from the programmed route, a voice will say, “Recalculating.” Directions to get you back on the correct route to your destination will follow. While using a GPS, there are times that you may decide to diverge from the prescribed route, and it can be very aggravating to keep hearing the voice, “Recalculating.” We start POSTSCRIPT yelling at the voice, “Enough by Alan Hirsch already!” This is the way it can be when our own will comes in conflict We need to be aware that within with the direction Jesus wants middle-class culture there is much us to go. Prevailing culture, that is contrary to authentic gospel Western or otherwise, can be values. And this is not a negative profoundly hostile to the Jesus statement about middle-class way of life and kingdom of God people per se—I myself am from thinking. Ours is a culture that a very middle-class family—but constantly promotes an agenda rather to recognize that much of entitlement, personal gratifithat goes by the name is simply cation, safety, security, comfort, a culture preoccupied with safety and convenience. This mindset and security developed mostly is at extreme odds with the in pursuit of what seems to be agenda of the humble Master.

Jesus modeled and taught a lifebest for our children. And this is style of letting others go first, understandable as long as it does daily seeking to dispense mercy not become obsessive. But when and grace, and picking up the these impulses of middle-class towel of the servant to do the culture fuse with consumerism, most menial of duties when the as they most often do, we can add opportunity arises. In a word, the obsession with comfort and it totally flies in the face of the convenience to the list. And this idea of upward mobility and is not a good mix—at least as far the right to the pursuit of hapas the gospel, discipleship, and piness. Too often, as with the missional church are concerned.

GPS, we choose our own direction and tune out the voice that keeps telling us we are off course.

Over and over again, we find the kingdom ethos to be counterintuitive. “The first will be last, and the last will be first.” “Those who save their lives will lose them, and those who lose their lives for my sake, will discover them.” Jesus is telling us that the source of abundant life and the purest form of joy lies in following his lead regarding how we disperse (spend) our lives. This is fundamental to what it really means for Jesus to be our Lord.

To live in the realm of the extraordinary means we take seriously the mandate of kingdom citizenship as taught and modeled by Jesus. We yoke ourselves to Jesus himself, submitting to his directives and authority for our lives. Fuller Theological Seminary professor George Ladd sheds light on this idea: “While Israel as a whole, including both leaders and people, refused to accept Jesus’ offer of the Kingdom, a substantial group did respond in faith. Discipleship to Jesus was not like discipleship to a Jewish rabbi. The rabbis bound their disciples not to themselves but to the Torah: Jesus bound his disciples to himself. The rabbis offered something outside of themselves: Jesus offered himself alone. Jesus required his disciples to surrender without reservation to his authority.”8 One of the prime biblical metaphors for the church is the body of Christ. This speaks to the idea of followers of Christ as occupying the position and responsibility of being flesh and blood containers and agents of Jesus’ love, mercy, goodness, and works. So, our perception of the gospel must be that it not only provides a salvation that leads to security in postdeath life, but it also transforms or redeems our earthly life and extends the kingdom of God throughout our world. We close this chapter with the profound words of The Message author Eugene Peterson in his take on Romans 12:1–2:

> So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your
> everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work,
> and walking-around life—and place it before God as an of-
> you can do for him. Don’t become so well-adjusted to your
> your attention on God. You’ll be changed from the inside
