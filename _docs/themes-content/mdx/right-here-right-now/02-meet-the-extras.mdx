In the BBC series Extras, Ricky Gervais portrays the struggling Andy Millman, a wannabe actor who spends the majority of his waking moments on movie sets, stroking egos in hopes of being “discovered.” Scheming, even begging, for movie lines or positions in scenes that place him in the camera viewfinder fills his days.

Just about anyone can play the part of an extra because extras are the nobodies of the acting world. They are necessary though, because a scene would be incomplete without them. It just wouldn’t look or feel completely natural or believable if they were not present. But the focus of the camera is always the focus of the storyline—the star(s) of the show.

Extras are interchangeable parts who come and go with less than little fanfare.

Our own lives are filled to overflowing with “extras.” Each and every day as we venture from the seclusion of our homes we encounter them. The lady pumping gas in the next stall, the construction workers eating lunch on the tailgate of their pickup, the elderly gentleman pushing the shopping cart along the bread aisle. These are common examples of those we pass by and intermingle with every day, paying virtually no attention to. They are but background scenery to the main storyline, which is my life, my story, and my agenda. Author and pastor Randy Frazee describes a common scenario:

When the Johnsons go out for routine errands, they seldom encounter or relate to actual, real live people anymore. They get gas at a station where there is no attendant. Bob just sticks his credit card in the automated machine, fills up his gas tank, and takes off, not speaking to a single person in the process. Like most banking experiences these days, the Johnsons’ experience is an automated one. When the Johnsons venture out to the large mall fifteen minutes away, they find themselves surrounded by a multitude of people, but they know no one. People seem to work hard at avoiding conversation.1 The question we need to ask is how things could be changed POSTSCRIPT if we were to cultivate the habit by Alan Hirsch of opening ourselves to the voice of the Holy Spirit.

Seeing a funeral procession, his eyes moved through the denseness of the mourners to settle upon the broken and weeping mother of the young boy being carried away for burial. On another occasion as he was surrounded by pressing crowds, his eyes focused on a man in a tree whom he knew needed an encounter with him. At yet another time his gaze zeroed in on one particular tax collector, one of the most despised professions in Jewish culture at the time. Jesus invited this man named Levi (later called Matthew) to follow him as a disciple.

Most of us are so familiar with these stories that in our mind’s eye we have no problem seeing these people as individuals. What we tend to forget POSTSCRIPT is that they were each part of a dusty, eddying throng of people by Alan Hirsch in a densely populated scene.

The reason these three biblical This is leading us into the issue characters stand out is because commonly known by the Latin term Jesus’ listening ear to the voice imago Dei, which means “the image of his Father, coupled with eyes of God.” To believe in the imago that sought to see what the FaDei is not to ignore or bypass the ther might want to show him inherent sinfulness of all people.

Snap judgments, it turns out, aren’t arbitrary at all, but are informed by what we see and know of our opinions about what certain personality traits suggest.”2 Utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, researchers at New York University and Harvard scanned the brains of people “as they formed first impressions of fictional individuals based on simple descriptions and value representations.”3 The results revealed “considerable activity in the amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex regions of the brain during the ‘encoding’ period of information that was relevant to impression formation.” The researchers’ conclusion was that people unwittingly draw impressions “based on ambiguous and complex information but still, we’re able to judge quickly how we feel about other people, and the ability to do this is due to the innate abilities of various brain regions.” Consider the following from additional studies: Psychologists agree that snap judgments are a holistic phenomenon in which clues (mellifluous voice, Rolex watch, soggy handshake, hunched shoulders) hit us all at once and form an impression larger than their sum. Just three seconds are sufficient to make a conclusion about fresh acquaintances....

Nalini Ambady, professor of psychology at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, studies first impressions carved from brief exposure to another person’s behavior, what she calls “thin slices” of experience. She says humans have developed the ability to quickly decide whether a new person will hurt or enrich us—judgments that had lifesaving ramifications in an earlier era.

She believes that thin slices are generated in the most primitive area of the brain, where feelings are also processed, which accounts for the emotional punch of some first encounters.

Immediate distrust of a certain car salesman or affinity for a prospective roommate originates in the deepest corners of the mind.4

As Jesus’ ambassadors, seeking to have a right here, right now impact, it is imperative that we cultivate in ourselves the Jesus habit of moving past prejudiced assessments of others we get via these initial impressions. We should work to develop a hearing ear and seeing eye to what the Lord is saying to us about another individual. A good example of this is found in the beginning of Jesus’ encounter with the young man commonly referred to as the Rich Ruler.

> Beholding Others

Then Jesus beholding him loved him.

Mark 10:21 KJV

Contextually this verse occurs shortly after this wealthy young man has approached Jesus and asked him how he might obtain eternal life. Jesus begins to iterate the Ten Commandments, and the young man may have interrupted Jesus, saying he has kept them since his childhood. It is at this point that verse 21 says, “Then Jesus beholding him loved him” (KJV, our emphasis). This phrase is hugely important for us to grasp, or rather be grasped by. The word “beholding” is a Greek word used in astronomy for the study of the constellations. It means something way deeper than simply noticing or glancing at. There is much deeper intensity involved in the looking. Thayer’s Lexicon provides this definition:

## Beholding

1. to have (the power of) understanding
2. to discern mentally, observe, perceive, discover,

understand

3. to turn the thoughts or direct the mind to a thing, to consider, contemplate, to look at, to weigh carefully, examine6

The basic definition of the word “beholding” here means to look at something in order to learn about it. It evokes the idea of sincere and undivided attention that encapsulates the object of attention into the mind and complete consideration of the viewer.

Recently my wife and I were sitting on our back patio, enjoying the midnight cool and easy conversation, when we noticed a couple of shooting stars, which is always a thrill.

The next morning we read in the news that the earth was in the midst of a particular meteor shower over a three-day period. That evening our teenage children joined us in the backyard, lying face up on sleeping bags with focused attention on the night sky. In a matter of less than an hour, we witnessed dozens of shooting stars, each greeted with oohs, aahs, and wows! According to the meteorologists, the same general number of meteors fell the night before. The difference in our two evenings under the night sky was that one night we were just there passively noticing, the next night we were intentionally beholding the constellations. The biggest difference between the two nights was not what was happening in the sky but the attention we gave to the sky.

When Jesus “beheld” this young man, he was considering everything about him, not just what he saw with his eyes and heard with his ears. Jesus was looking for and seeing something much deeper than someone who was angst ridden and just wanted to make sure his eternal security was in place.

This was what he could see on the surface. But Jesus always looked beyond the surface. He was listening to the voice of the Holy Spirit. Jesus was focused more on what the Father was saying about this young man than what the young man himself was saying.

The words used here by the Gospel writer were chosen carefully. He wanted us to know Jesus expressed his love by beholding the young man. This was a key part of “seeking and saving the lost,” the very purpose he declared he was on earth for (Luke 19:10). For Jesus was constantly beholding people in this manner. Scan the Gospels and we witness many examples of this. Jesus’ encounters with Zaccheus, the woman at the well, widows, POSTSCRIPT

In fact it is important to point out that living missionally is the sum total of both small and larger acts of reaching out.

Bestselling author Peter Senge points out the importance of seeing others that is found in the traditional greeting of a tribal people. “Among the tribes of northern Natal in South Africa, the most common greeting, equivalent to ‘hello’ in English, is the expression: Sawu bona. It literally means, ‘I see you.’ If you are a member of the tribe, you might reply by saying Sikhona, ‘I am here.’ The order of the exchange is important: until you see me, I do not exist. It’s as if, when you see me, you bring me into existence.”7 The present discontinuity and lack of integration of life in the twenty-first century has produced a society of strangers who seldom “see” one another. We will go deeper into the issue of estrangement and fragmentation in the chapters ahead, but it is important for us to consider here that our contemporary culture fosters a feeling of insignificance among others. For example, I find myself wondering if the fascination of Twitter and Facebook is mistakenly conceived as simple unabashed narcissism but is actually (at least in part) a cry of “Please see me, I am here, and I exist!” When people are tweeting and Facebooking their every move (“Sitting on the patio, enjoying iced tea and the dogs playing”) you have to wonder if there is a bit of loneliness going on. As technology has increased, the overall effect has not only failed to draw us closer but has actually spawned breeches in community and a breakdown of authentic social fabric coupled with a broad sense of isolation and loneliness for people, although their daily lives are spent in the midst of others. Michael Schluter and David Lee wrote a wonderful book on relational dynamics in the West. They say:

Of all the changes accompanying industrial development, probably the most significant from the standpoint of encounter is that the scale of community we relate to has expanded beyond recognition. As a villager almost anywhere in twelfthcentury Europe you would have known a limited number of people very well simply because you were stuck with them.

It is difficult to imagine in the age of the car just how much isolation results from having to go places on foot—the nearest town becomes equivalent of a hundred-mile drive. Not surprisingly, therefore, pre-industrial communities tended to be self-sufficient, the village blacksmith and the village baker providing the nearest and most convenient source of their respective services as perhaps only the village pub does today. Everybody knew everybody else; everybody relied on everybody else.8 For us as God’s missional people, being sent with a redemptive agenda, it is important that we understand and take into account the nature of contemporary culture, considering how we might be salt and light in the midst of an alienated and bored society of strangers. Behind the eyes of many people we brush past on a typical day is a soul who is seeking relationship and connection with others, and in many (if not most) cases a conscious or unconscious search for God. Schluter and Lee point out the barriers we face in this culture of strangers:

> In the West, we find ourselves scattered too far and moving
> too fast to maintain a strong base of encounter relationships.

Relationship is less and less a matter of sharing the same patch of earth and the same block of air. We meet many more people, but less frequently; we still have friends and families, but on the whole these relationships are fewer, more intermittent, less stable. Instead we feel millions of tiny threads tying us into general and indirect relationship with people we will never touch or talk to, people who as individuals we know nothing about, nor ever will. And this has a profound effect on the way we live. For it means that in the mega-community we live among strangers.9

## Do Talk to Strangers

The Old Testament is replete with direct instructions from God on the treatment of strangers, and Jesus addressed it as well. The social impact that comes from being a stranger or the new kid on the block is a bitter pill to swallow for beings created in the image of God. Westerners have perfected the art of avoiding encounters with strangers. It is not uncommon for two individuals to pass on a sidewalk or in the halls of a hotel or office complex, brushing within a foot or so of one another, without speaking or acknowledging one another whatsoever.

This deliberate avoidance of engaging strangers is really remarkable when we pause to consider it. Now, no doubt, if you live in New York City or ride a subway or train on your daily commute, it would be virtually impossible to speak to everyone you come along. But you get the idea. For the most part we live in a culture that doesn’t even try to be friendly or engaging.

Afew years ago a young couple relocated to the suburban home next door to my family. They moved in on a weekend when we were away so we were not able to welcome them or extend greetings as they were moving furniture into the house.

The entire week went by without us having a chance to meet our new neighbors because I would be on the way to my office early in the morning and I noticed that the husband didn’t return home from his job until late in the evening. I thought I would get a chance to say “hi” by the weekend.

The following Saturday morning I heard a lawn mower running in the front yard, and I peeked out the window and saw my new neighbor mowing his front lawn. “Perfect,” I thought, “I’ll run out and finally introduce myself and welcome him to the neighborhood.” I walked to the side of my front lawn and stood, waiting to catch his attention. As he turned the lawn mower and headed back in my direction, I was pretty sure that his eyes quickly darted toward and back away from me, but although he was headed straight for me, he did not look up. I figured that he was going to just come closer to me and shut off his mower and exchange greetings.

No dice. He got to within about three feet of me and I thought he was going to run me over before he stopped, turned, and headed for his next pass with the lawn mower. Thinking to myself, “Maybe he just possibly—I don’t know how. Naw, no way. But I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt—may have not noticed me.” I sidestepped over to where his next pass would bring him. This happened three times, with me standing there, coffee cup in hand, most likely looking (and definitely feeling) pretty foolish. It became a cat-and-mouse game.

My new neighbor would come to the end of his yard, with me an arm’s length away, in front of him. He would turn around and head away. I would step over a couple of feet and the whole thing would happen again. I finally slinked back into the house, pretty sure I had just entered bizarro world.

Afew days later I was able to finally corner the guy as he was watering his lawn—he was a nice fellow, just somewhat shy.

Brennan Manning notes our propensity to avoid those on the margins of our attention as well as Jesus’ words on the matter: There exists a problem of epic biblical proportions: I’ve divided the human community into certain categories. There are a few people whom I like, and a multitude whom I seldom think about, move proactively toward, or manifest any concern for. Yet the evangelical witness described in Matthew and Luke quashes discrimination of any kind. “If all you do is love the lovable, do you expect a bonus?” Jesus asks.

“Anybody can do that. If you simply say hello to those who greet you, do you expect a medal? Any run-of-the-mill sinner can do that” (Matt. 5:46–47, The Message). Any of us can love someone with whom we have a mutual interest or attraction. I find it effortless to turn on to people who favor my existence and make me feel good. So did the contemptible tax-collectors, traitors to the Jewish cause.10

> Smile and the Whole World Smiles with You

My wife, Sherri, would be the first to admit that she is by nature a shy person, but several years ago she purposely focused on developing the habit of seeing others as she shopped for groceries by greeting them with a smile and a “hi.” This became a practice and for her a genuine spiritual discipline, as she consciously trained herself to be friendly, complimentary, or initiating conversation when the opportunity presented itself.

For several years now Sherri has engaged herself in the practice of purposely sharing greetings and smiles while she shops. Not to overstate the matter, but a routine, even mundane or dreaded chore has now become a mission of friendliness, requiring nothing more than a willing participant to initiate the exchange.

According to researchers, expressions are contagious, be they happy, angry, sad, or smiling. It is difficult for us to remain expressionless. Swedish researchers concluded the unconscious mind usurps power over our facial muscles. The leaders of the study told volunteers to react to a series of pictures of expressionless, happy or angry faces. They were told to make frowning, smiling or expressionless faces in return. Often the face they were told to attempt was the opposite of what might be expected—meeting a smile with a frown, or a frown with a smile. Movements in their facial muscles were measured using equipment that picked up electrical signals from the fibers. However, the results showed that volunteers simply did not have total control over their facial muscles. While it was easy to frown back at a picture of an angry man, it was much more difficult to pull a smile. Even though study subjects were trying consciously to curb their natural reactions, the twitching in their muscles told a different story. [The lead doctor] describes this as “emotional contagion.”11

Recently two students from Purdue University took it upon themselves to grab a spot on the college campus each week to give away free compliments to anyone who wanted one. The pair drew widespread notoriety from POSTSCRIPT entities such as National Public Radio, Good Morning America, by Alan Hirsch and even an appearance on Oprah.

They eventually went on a tour of We are called to be a community of several major cities, spreading the holiness. This is not about moral compliment gospel.

Three recent books speak to this malady: Un Christian by David Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons, Dan Kimball’s They Like Jesus but Not the Church, and Dan Merchant’s Lord Save Us from Your Followers all relate a litany of interviews and exchanges with non-Christians that perceive Christians and the church as being negative and judgmental in tone and demeanor. We encourage our readers to decide today to change your parcel of influence and be a smile giver throughout your day-to-day travels.

> People of Shalom How lovely on the mountains
> Are the feet of him who brings good news,

> Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness,

Who announces salvation, And says to Zion, “Your God reigns!” Isaiah 52:7 NASB If we are known for anything, we Christians should be known as people of peace; that wherever we traverse, peace emits from us. In what most scholars agree was one of Jesus’ most central teachings, he proclaimed, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God” (Matt. 5:9 NRSV). Jesus himself said that one of the key distinguishing features that marks us as the children of God will be peace.

In another passage, the apostle Paul encourages, “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone” (Rom. 12:18). Think about that. What would happen if every place you were to go to today, as far as it depends on you, peace would be manifest?

Peace is a consistent theme throughout the New Testament, and Paul continually refers to the Lord as “the God of peace” (Rom. 15:33; 16:20; 1 Cor. 14:33) and the church as the benefactors and carriers of that same peace. In short, we are the people of God’s Shalom. Our lives—the way we conduct ourselves—should give off the scent of peace. This is a key fruit of the Spirit we should be feeding to the world.

Unfortunately, peace is not the most common element found in Christians. One morning I was having coffee with a friend who was a pastor from my area. As our conversation moved to the subject of raising and developing disciples of Jesus who can transform a local community, he shook his head and frowned, saying, “Disciples? I can’t even get my people to be nice to each other.” It reminded me of the famous rant by Jim Mora, coach of the I ndianapolis Colts, following a disappointing loss where his team played very poorly. An unfortunate reporter asked Mora about his team’s chances of success in the approaching playoffs and was met with a flabbergasted and irritated response. “Playoffs?! Don’t talk about playoffs! You kiddin’ me?! Playoffs?! I just hope we can win a game!” My pastor friend had difficulty imagining his church as a village of disciples because the reality was, they couldn’t even get the “peace” thing down—something so fundamental to the faith.

In our quest to carry out a faithful mission as God’s ambassadors, we should honestly evaluate our “peace” quotient.

We should consider whether or not we evoke peace in our daily interactions with others and make a point of “so far as it depends on us, be at peace with all men.” The Word of God commands us to pursue peace (2 Tim. 2:22; 1 Peter 3:11), and one can only imagine the results if we who claim the sign of the cross placed as much thought and effort into cultivating peace as we do in justifying ourselves and criticizing others.

## Creative Grace

Use your heads as you live and work among outsiders. Don’t miss a trick. Make the most of every opportunity. Be gracious in your speech. The goal is to bring out the best in others in a conversation, not put them down, not cut them out.

Colossians 4:5–6 Message Todd Hunter, pastor and Anglican bishop, provides an excellent exegesis of this passage as he unpacks the key phrases in it, pointing out “that faith in and following Jesus spreads as the cooperative friends of Jesus live in creative goodness for the sake of others through the animating and empowering presence of the Holy Spirit.”12

- Use your heads. This means that we should

be present and alert to our life, to God and to the people and events of our life....

- As you live and work among outsiders.... Paul reminded [the Colossians] that the normal routines of life, the people and events that make our communities, matter.

These are spiritual. We don’t need to add “spiritual” activities to our life as much as we need to make our actual, everyday life spiritual....

- Don’t miss a trick. Make the most of every

opportunity. Here Paul encourages us to live constant lives of creative goodness.

We don’t want to miss any opportunity; even small things matter....

- Be gracious in your speech. What is

gracious speech? It is others-oriented.

It asks, What will these words do to my hearer? Gracious speech seeks the good of others....

- The goal is to bring out the best in others.

We act and speak for the sake of others with the goal that they’ll know we are interested in their good....

- In a conversation. Respect—listening to

others, really hearing them, connecting with what they are saying even if we do not agree—is at the heart of this passage....

- [Do] not put them down, [do] not cut

them out. The growing hostility toward Christians is very much a reflection of what outsiders feel they receive from believers. They say their aggression simply matches the oversized opinions and egos of Christians.13

## From the Mouth of Babes

Have you ever been rebuked by a four-year-old? Afew years back I was standing on the sidewalk in front of a small bicycle shop as the owner was testing a new bike I had just purchased.

He was making adjustments to the brakes and riding it up and down the side street after each change to the settings.

Standing alongside me was his little girl. She had not uttered a word and seemed concerned about nothing beyond the lollipop in her mouth and the doll clutched in her arms.

Trying to make conversation as we both stood watching her father on the bicycle passing by, I said, “Your dad is the bike man, isn’t he?” That simple statement jolted this little girl out of her silence. I had just awakened a sleeping giant. With a “pop,” she pulled the sucker out of her mouth, looked up at me through squinted eyes, and declared, “He’s not the bike man!

He’s Daddy man!” Needless to say, I was left speechless.

Her message could not have been clearer: “Dude, you have no clue. Don’t you dare minimize my dad and think you know him based on the limited vision and petty thought you have put into it. You are summing his value up in terms of his vocation and what you see him do, not based on who he is.

The fact of the matter is that he is my provider, my protector, and my hero! You just don’t get it do you?” I had just been schooled by a four-year-old on what it means to behold someone.

> IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FORMINGAMISSIONAL LIFESTYLE
> Pray—

- Before leaving your home for the day, ask the Lord to

open your eyes and heart to those along your path. Ask the Holy Spirit to alert you to opportunities to engage strangers with the goodness of Jesus.

- Pray to see the imago Dei (the image of God) in people

and to see them as God does.

## Practice—

- Be a smile-maker. Cultivate the habit of smiling and

greeting others every time you have the opportunity.

Smile at your waitress, your cashier, etc. You may want to place some smiley-face stickers in your car and places around your house as a reminder to smile.

- Be a peacemaker. Speak a good word in the midst of

tense situations.

## Welcome new neighbors—

- Take some baked goods to new neighbors as they are

moving in or shortly thereafter.

- I nvite their children to play with your kids.
- Host a “welcome to the neighborhood” dinner party and

invite the new neighbors and a few established neighbors to attend.

## Take inventory—

- At the end of your day, consider specific moments as to

how you viewed the people you came into contact with.

Did you “behold” others or view them as scenery?
