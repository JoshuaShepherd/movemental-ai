## Rediscovering the Joy of Hospitality

Is there not a crisis of hospitality in our society? It is tragically evident in homelessness and widespread hostility to immigrants. But it affects almost everyone in less noticeable ways as well. A stranger smiles, and we cautiously turn away. In our retreat from hospitality, we find that even friends and relatives sit at our tables less often than they used to.

About an hour later I awoke to the inviting smell of something cooking and went downstairs to join everyone else for dinner. I had been told that our hosts were Americans, but I knew nothing else about them. I brightened up when I detected a familiar Texas drawl, and they told me they were from Ft. Worth. Wow! The place immediately warmed up about fifteen degrees.

The meal was great and Bob and Jo Ann broke out a bottle of wine they said they had been saving for special visitors. With electricity available only a few hours per day, the rest of the evening was spent in a candlelit living room with singing, prayer, and sharing stories about our lives and what the heck we were all doing in this place. After I crawled into bed, I wrote in my journal that I felt so much better than I did a few hours earlier. My journey had just begun and the next couple of weeks would include trips deep into Taliban-infested territory, but a feeling of safety and calm took over my earlier uneasiness. There was something about my hosts that had brought peace and a new energy to my faith. Without mentioning it, they identified with what I was going through and did everything they could to not only make me feel at home but bring the presence of Jesus to bear upon my situation.

## Always a Stranger

Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.

Deuteronomy 10:19 NKJV It is one thing to be a stranger in a place you are vaguely familiar with. Say, like someone from Southern California traveling through the Deep South. Sure, the Californian will need to get used to ordering iced tea by specifying “unsweetened” or “sweetened,” and he will have to get used to hearing “Sweet Home Alabama” on every radio station at least once every thirty minutes. But at least he can speak the language, understand the laws, and be secure in knowing he is a citizen, at home in the United States. That can be tough enough. But it is altogether different, much harder, to be a stranger in a strange land. It is this idea that lies at the heart of the call for all Christians to live a lifestyle of biblical hospitality.

The roots of the church reach back to God’s dealings with Abraham’s descendants. Years of living as refugees in exile and slavery meant the Jewish people had often found themselves as aliens in unfamiliar territories: “The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Lev. 19:34 NASB).

We need a renewed mindset that we are aliens in this world and citizens of heaven. When this begins to slip, we also begin to lose a kingdom perspective and attitude.

But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ. (Phil. 3:20)

Time and time again I have witnessed that poor people are usually the most generous among us. I have delivered meals to needy families, and before I was out the door, they were calling neighbors over to share the groceries with them.

Talk to workers at homeless shelters and soup kitchens and you will discover many of them were homeless at one time themselves. Their thankfulness and identification with the situation of others makes them want to serve.

Mike Mc I ntyre is a journalist who traveled across America, with no money, relying on the kindness of strangers. He writes, “I walk on, wondering how it is that the people who have the least to give are often the ones who give the most.” Quoting a woman who had very little herself but shared a bountiful meal with him, “She said, ‘We don’t have much, but we don’t mind sharing what we have... I know what it’s like to be hungry. There’ve been times when I’ve been down to my last ten cents, but people have always helped me.’ ”2

## More Than Tea and Cookies

Words evolve over time, their meanings changing along the way, and hospitality is a word that has done so. It usually stirs ideas that fall short of the biblical meaning. Henri Nouwen suggests, “At first the word ‘hospitality’ might evoke the image of soft sweet kindness, tea parties, bland conversations and a general atmosphere of coziness.”3 I have to admit that although I’ve studied it quite a bit over the years and attempt to live a biblical version, when I hear the word “hospitality,” I still wrestle with pictures of a Martha Stewart dinner party with fine china, mini-sandwiches, caviar, and crackers.

Scenes such as this have their place within the concept of hospitality, but the biblical picture is far deeper and richer.

As Nouwen says, “If there is any concept worth restoring to its original depth and evocative potential, it is the concept of hospitality. It is one of the richest biblical terms that can deepen and broaden our insight in our relationships to our fellow human beings.”4 Almost every year our family hosts a Christmas party that everyone loves to attend because Sherri, my wife, is such a great hostess. She wants everything from the front porch to the back fence gate in perfect order. The buffet of snacks, drinks, and especially her famous eggnog is always both great tasting and presented as though they were staged for a magazine feature. Every candle must be lit and the background music has to be just right. I learned a long time ago to just shut up and do what she asks (tells) me to do as we prepare for the party. It took several years for me to understand that her determination for everything to be perfect at these parties was not because she was vain or felt the excellence or lack thereof reflected on her. No, her joy is in everyone having a great time and a wonderful experience. Sherri’s delight is in bringing joy to our guests.

Biblical hospitality does carry with it the idea of being a host, but it is not limited to the “party host” concept. What we are serving is the good news of the kingdom of God.

Everyone is traveling through a spiritually broken world. It is a hostile environment. The event we are hosting is life, everyday-doing-what-you-do life. Grasping a biblical understanding of hospitality starts with viewing ourselves as having a God-given responsibility for hosting life, right here and right now. It is especially tied to love for strangers. In fact, the word used in the New Testament for “hospitality” is the Greek word, philoxenia, which is a combination of the words for “love” (phileo) and “stranger” (xenos). In line with the proposition that we have lost the meaning of biblical hospitality, Christine Pohl says:

## The Thing about Strangers

We have become good at taking a lot of Jesus’ calls to sacrifice and risk and dismissing them under the guise of “being good stewards” or making statements such as, “It would be unwise for me to bring a perfect stranger into my home. He could harm my family or rob us.” But Jesus said genuine disciples are to pick up the cross every day. The thing about crosses is that they are not comfortable. They are risky, heavy, and humiliating. The only way to get around this is to bypass picking up the cross.

## The worst thing about strangers is that they are... well, POSTSCRIPT strange. You don’t know who by Alan Hirsch they are, where they came from, their background, or their motives. For all you know that little We should ask if our lack of old lady in Wal-Mart may be a hospitality is pointing to something real-life black widow.

But here’s the deal—our Christianity is not complete apart from obedience in regard to welcoming the stranger into our lives and homes. In fact, part of the litmus test for qualifying widows to receive the care of the church community was whether or not the widow had been prone to lodging strangers (1 Tim. 5:10). The same was true regarding who could be considered qualified as an elder in a congregation (1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8). Elders were expected POSTSCRIPT to practice the act of hospitality—a love for strangers. by Alan Hirsch The great equalizer about strangers is that they always I clearly remember when Nick come in pairs, at the very least.

> Hospitality and the Household of Faith

Regarding the lack of hospitality, even among Christians, Dorothy Bass writes: I ronically, it is not just hospitality to the “stranger” that is in peril in our society. We are short not only of tables that welcome strangers but even of tables that welcome friends.

In a society that prizes youthfulness, the elderly are often isolated from the affection and care of their own families. In many busy families, children find no after-school welcome home, and spouses find little time to host one another over supper. And when we become estranged—separated by grievances large or small, or simply crowded out of one another’s lives—we all too often become “strangers” even to those we once loved. Can we move beyond strangeness and estrangement to learn the skills of welcoming one another and to claim the joy of homecoming?6 Hospitality was an extremely serious issue for the apostles.

It was as vital to church life for the early church as, say, tithing or attending church services is to today’s church. In fact, tithing is never explicitly commanded in any of the epistles, but hospitality is, several times. Here are a few verses:

Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor... contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality. (Rom. 12:10, 13 NASB) Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it. (Heb.

13:2 NASB)

> Be hospitable to one another without complaint. (1 Peter 4:9 NASB)

I know a professor at a major seminary, a world-famous author of over a dozen books, who had been in England for over twenty years and had never been invited once to any of his colleagues’ houses for a meal. He had meals at restaurants with them many times, but never experienced hospitality in a home of the people he worked with for over two decades!

But is it all that unusual after all? Take a moment and think about your relationships in your current church community.

Ask yourself a couple of questions: How many other members’ homes have I been in, and how many people in my church have been in my home? Ask a few other church members to answer the same questions. Forget about extensive churchwide surveys. Whether you are a staff member or church member, the answers to those two questions are all the empirical data you need to know regarding the practice of hospitality in your church community. The contemporary church as a whole has neglected biblical hospitality. There is no one person or group of people to blame. As evangelicals, we are all reading the same Bible and have neglected the same portions of Scripture. It’s not important to critique it to death. We just need to reclaim the habit of biblical hospitality and start living it.

## Opportunities under Our Noses

Opportunities to welcome others and practice hospitality abound, if we will only dream a little. Let’s look at a few:

## Adopt Some Students

Gary and Susan are an empty-nest couple who are dear friends of our family. For almost two decades now we have watched them be “Mom and Pop away from Mom and Pop” for several young people from the local college. The students are welcomed into their home on a regular basis for meals and general fun times. Gary and Susan have turned their home into a home away from home for hundreds of young people over the years. Gary’s quick and corny wit and Susan’s great cooking have made their home a hot spot for college students. I recently looked at Susan’s friends list on Facebook. It is full of young people and past students who are now parents themselves who continue to share their gratefulness for Gary and Susan’s hospitality in a time in their lives when they were far from home.

## Adopt a Grandparent

The nature of our culture is one that has caused many families to become spread across states. For many elderly people this means their grown children live far from them.

This situation can not only feed loneliness but also leave the elderly in helpless situations at times. This situation hit home for me personally. My family and I live over 600 miles from my parents, and they began to decline in health a few years ago. They were still able to drive and cook for themselves, but some things were becoming very difficult for them to handle.

Pete and Debra Yabarra have lived next door to them for almost twenty years. My mom and dad watched their kids grow up, and there were always a lot of lawn chair visits between them and Pete and Debra. As my folks’ health began to take a slow decline, the Yabarra family began to naturally take up the slack. Their son, Rocky, mowed their lawn, refusing to be paid with anything but my mom’s home-baked pies.

Pete took care of all the leaky faucets and general household maintenance and even installed a gate in the backyard fence that separated their yards so that my folks could come over to their house and spend time with them around their pool.

Debra kept a caring eye on them overall. With us living so far away, this was an enormous weight off my mind, knowing my folks had someone watching over them.

## Adopt a Single-Mom Family

I used to tell my congregation that single moms are the modern-day equivalent to the New Testament widow. The early church was obligated to care for widows because they faced so many difficulties in caring for themselves economically and practically. Most single moms juggle careers, children, and finances with little to no relief in sight.

Many a single mom adds higher education to the mix as the only hope for a better future for her and her children.

Staci is a single mom who lives a few houses down from Steve and Jessica Mather, a family that decided to open their lives and home to Staci and her kids. Staci is enrolled in night school for nursing, and three afternoons a week

Communion Apple sticker and placed it belongs to the people of God... consider yourselves ordained! on her PC in the spot where the Apple symbol is found on a Mac. Not surprisingly, it didn’t change the performance of her computer.

The operating system trumped the label. This is very similar to what has happened to the Lord’s Supper, or as many early Christians would have called it, the common meal. We have reduced the joy of a bountiful buffet to a solemn ceremony around a thumb-sized wafer and micro shot glass of grape juice. As my grandmother would have said, “That’s not enough to feed a bird.” The lack of substance betrays the label. This is no “supper.” There is not even enough for hors d’oeuvres.

When Jesus gathered his disciples around the table for the Passover meal, it was a visible expression of what was about to become reality. For hundreds of years the Jewish people had observed a feast that recalled the passing of the death angel over the homes of the Israelites who had sacrificed and sprinkled the blood of a lamb upon their doorposts. Jesus was the true sacrificial lamb, and he took the bread and broke it, saying, “This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me” (Luke 22:19 NKJV). He was speaking of his body given as sacrifice for our sins. The next verse says The Lord’s Supper

- Bread Supper Meal Cup

And he took bread, gave
Likewise He also took thanks, and broke it, and the cup after supper, gave it to them, saying, saying, “This cup is the “This is my body which new covenant in My is given for you; do this blood, in remembrance of me.” which is shed for you.” Luke 22:19 Luke 22:20

> MY BODY RELATIONSHIP

## NEW COVENANT

given for you of new community in my blood

## The Lord’s Supper

“after supper” Jesus took the cup and announced it was the new covenant in his blood. In the ceremonial version of the Lord’s Supper, we observe the breaking of bread and passing of the cup, but we ignore supper. In the biblical version, the “bread” and the “cup” bracket the meal (supper) of the new covenanted family of God. Our traditional version eliminates the center of the Lord’s Supper and individualizes what is meant to be a communal celebration of sharing. We celebrate the bread and the cup, but we leave out the meal—the essential reminder of the new covenant community, the body of Christ.

In 1 Corinthians 11 the apostle Paul rebukes the believers because of their neglect and lack of caring for one another as it relates to the Lord’s Supper, or common meal. He warns that they are eating the bread and drinking the cup in an “unworthy” manner and says they should examine themselves before partaking (vv. 27–28).

I have participated in hundreds of communion services over the years and the majority of them are served with a warning for all who are about to partake to examine their lives and make sure their hearts are right and free from sin. This view of Paul’s admonition is well and good, by all means.

But by looking at the context of these verses, it is clear that Paul was warning the believers to cease neglecting one another. Some people were eating before others arrived, some were getting drunk, and others were in conflict with one another. Paul was saying they were missing the point of the Lord’s Supper. This was to be a meal of fellowship as the new community. The body and blood of the Lord had created an eternal covenant between himself and the family of believers. The apostle Paul points to Jesus’ own words that the common meal is a visible expression of his death and newly established covenant between God and one another.

Theologian Robert Banks says: Thus the meal that they shared together reminded the members of their relationship with Christ and one another and deepened those relationships in the same way that participation in an ordinary meal cements and symbolizes the bond between a family or group. This explains why Paul does not direct his criticisms against the attitudes of people toward the elements of bread and wine or against the quality of their individual relationships to God but against their attitudes and behavior towards one another.7 Sharing meals together on a regular basis is one of the most sacred practices we can engage in as believers. Food is the product of our work, an extension of our very lives. Breaking bread around the table of fellowship is both a symbolic and practical witness of the unity of the body of Christ. By bringing the fruit of our labor to be shared with others, we are saying “my life for your life.” Hospitality is about making places in our lives for others. It is lived out on several levels and in many ways. It encompasses friends, family, strangers, and neighbors. It is a daily opportunity to practice selfless, missional living, allowing us space to show love and affirm the dignity of others, regardless of their cultural status. The only thing holding back hospitality is us opening our hearts, our arms, and our homes.
