12. Hirsch and Hirsch, Untamed. We suggest that the reader explore what is

said there in relation to pre-conversion and post-conversion discipleship.

13. Hirsch, Forgotten Ways, 211ff.
14. Addison notes that preexisting relationships are a critical factor for the

exponential growth of a movement. “New religious movements fail when they become closed or semi-closed networks. For continued exponential growth, a movement must maintain open relationships with outsiders. They must reach out into new, adjacent social networks.” Stephen Addison, “Movement Dynamics: Keys to the Expansion and Renewal of the Church in Mission” (unpublished manuscript, 2003), 52. Stark argues that as movements grow, their “social surface” expands exponentially. Each new member opens up new networks of relationships between the movement and potential members—provided the movement continues to remain an open system. The forms of social networks will differ from culture to culture, but “however people constitute structures of direct interpersonal attachments, those structures will define the lines through which conversion will most readily proceed.” Rodney Stark, The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal, Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1996), 22.

15. For an excellent exploration into the power of networking, see Dwight

Friesen, Thy Kingdom Connected: What the Church Can Learn from Facebook, the I nternet, and Other Networks (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2009); or Neil Cole’s Church 3.0: Upgrades for the Future of the Church (CITY: Jossey-Bass, 2010).

17. See Untamed, section 2, to explore ways in which we as disciples must

challenge prevailing views of culture and The Shaping of Things to Come, chap.

9, to explore how and why the medium is the message.
