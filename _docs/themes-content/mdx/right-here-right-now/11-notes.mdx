George Barna, Revolution (Carol Stream: Tyndale, 2006); Dave Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons, Unchristian: What a New Generation Really Thinks about Christianity... and Why It Matters (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2007); and Dan Kimball’s They Like Jesus but Not the Church (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007) are just samplings of the research available.

5. See Debs and my book on missional Christianity/discipleship called Untamed,

especially chapters one and two on toxic religion and Frost and Hirsch, re Jesus, on Christianity minus Christ equals Religion 68ff..

6. Debs and I wrote a wholebook about obstructions that get in the way of

discipleship. See Untamed: Reactivating a Missional Form of Discipleship.

7. See the video “The Story of Stuff” at http://www. storyofstuff. com/.
8. Eminent philosopher Karl Popper traces the basis of this ecclesial structure

Plato’s idea of the Republic as the mediating institution between the real world of ideas and the false world of senses. The church assumes the role of mediating agent between God and the people. He, I think rightly, sees it one vast negative that led to an oppressive authorizing of the institution over the people. See Karl Popper, The Open Society and Its Enemies: The Spell of Plato, vol. 1 (New York: Routledge, 2002).

Alan Hirsch is the founding director of Forge Mission Training Network. He is the cofounder of shapevine. com, a ministry of Christianity Today International and an international forum for engaging with world-transforming ideas.

Currently he leads an innovative learning program called Future Travelers helping numerous megachurches become missional movements. He has also been part of the leadership team of Christian Associates, a missional church-planting agency with focus on Western Europe. Known for his innovative approach to mission, Alan is a teacher and key mission strategist for churches across the western world. His popular book The Shaping of Things to Come (with Michael Frost) is widely considered to be a seminal text on mission.

Alan’s book The Forgotten Ways has quickly become a key reference for missional thinking, particularly as it relates to missional movements. His book ReJesus, with Michael Frost, is a radical restatement of the role that Jesus plays in defining Christian movements. Untamed, his most recent book (with his wife Debra), is about missional discipleship for a missional church.

His experience in leadership includes leading a local church movement among the marginalized, developing training systems for innovative missional leadership, as well as heading up the Mission and Revitalization work of his denomination.

Alan is an adjunct professor at Fuller Seminary, George Fox Evangelical Seminary, and Wheaton College, among others, and lectures frequently throughout Australia, Europe, and the US.

Lance Ford is the cofounder and director of Christianity Today’s Shapevine. com, and the former director of the Northwood Church Multiplication Center. With more than twenty years of experience as a pastor and church planter, Lance is a writer, coach, and consultant who has designed unique training systems currently being used by networks, seminaries, and leaders throughout the world. He is also an adjunct professor at Biblical Seminary in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Lance serves as a Missional Strategist for the Mid America District of The Christian and Missionary Alliance and lives with his wife and their kids on a small hobby farm in Missouri.
