# Series Editor's Preface

Clearly coming into deeper knowledge and experience of God is a profound adventure into the infinite unknown. Given that we will always be finite creatures, and God always infinite, this adventure is one that is unlikely to ever end. So we might as well get used to the idea of journey, pilgrimage, risk, and exploration.

While we have libraries filled with books about spirituality, and literally tens of millions of books exploring aspects of theology, we have not been able to identify one significant book studying the nature of adventure itself—its role in shaping our thinking about God, our experience of life, or our participation in mission, church, or discipleship. Not one! Similarly, there is painfully little exploration on the associated subject of risk, liminality, communitas, and its implications in the life of faith and in leadership.

As one of the authors of this book, I found this deficiency shocking, and given that our experience of God and gospel partakes directly of the nature of adventure, and (as we shall see) the Bible has much to say about it, I believe this ought to disturb you, the reader. What insight does this give into how we experience God and existence itself?

Is our understanding of these matters now so passive and tedious that we simply miss this most illustrious metaphor of life—one that is so celebrated in myth, narrative, film, and poetry? And what then does this say about the church itself and how we view faith?

We think that nothing less than the renewal and vigor of Christianity, and with it the mission of the church, is bound up with this subject. Within these pages, the reader will find not only a fresh perspective on somewhat tired subjects but also an invigorated sense of elan vital along with (hopefully) an increasing desire to partake of a little adventure of one’s own.

Together with the other books that are now part of the series, we feel the book you're holding genuinely adds new knowledge to the church and some fresh impetus to partake more vigorously and faithfully in the redemptive mission of God in our day.

You proclaim your truth in every age by many voices: Direct those we pray who speak where many listen or write where many read; that they may do their part in making the heart of your people wise, its mind sound, and its will righteous!

Amen
