# Chapter 1: The Spirit's Edge: Putting Adventure Back into the Venture

I should have been a true and passionate Christian. The Adventurer. But now I live in 1924, and the Christian venture is done.

The adventure is gone out of Christianity. We must start on a new venture towards God.

—D. H. Lawrence

It is the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly seeking, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions. We are explorers.

—Ben Cisco, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine As many readers well know, the novelist D. H. Lawrence was no friend of the church. He believed that the repressive morality of Christianity was the source of much of the social and political disintegration of Western Europe in the early twentieth century. Writing in 1924, he claimed that any sense of daring or adventure had been leached from Christianity, leaving only the brittle shell of suppression and safe respectability—Christianity, in his opinion, was a spent force.

While we might agree with aspects of his diagnosis, we are certainly at odds with his prognosis. Lawrence saw no hope for reenergizing the adventureless church of his day, but we are not at all pessimistic. Indeed, we believe that twenty-first-century Christians are yearning to see the adventure put back into Christianity, into the relationship with the living God—where it rightly belongs.

Lawrence’s mistaken answer was to invoke some kind of gnostic spirituality, involving a reconnection with the purifying forces of nature. Whatever the error of his personal choice, he wrote movingly of fresh energy beyond institutional forms of religion. We do well to heed the power of these words: When we get out of the glass bottles of our ego, and when we escape like squirrels turning in the cages of our personality and get into the forests again, we shall shiver with cold and fright but things will happen to us so that we don't know ourselves.

Cool, unlying life will rush in, and passion will make our bodies taut with power, we shall stamp our feet with new power and old things will fall down, we shall laugh, and institutions will curl up like burnt paper.1 It might be tempting for Christian readers to reject this as poetic mumbo jumbo, but we do so at our peril. What Lawrence was yearning for, and what we equally yearn for, was that sense of life, fully lived and completely free from the cramping influence of various controlling institutionalisms.

The “cool, unlying life” that Lawrence wanted to rush in on him is the very thing that Jesus offers his followers. This life is not ours through the purifying effects of nature, but by the purifying death and resurrection of Jesus. It is our faith in him that brings life, and with such life the followers of Jesus will “stamp our feet with new power and old things will fall down.” The writer of Hebrews celebrates this very power—a power derived from the risen Christ, a power that is testified to by that great collection of witnesses, the faithful ones. In each case, the heroes he brings forth as evidence of faith’s redemptive power are those who resisted the powers of their day and embraced the very adventure Lawrence so deeply desires.

Hebrews is a song about faith as an adventure, and chapter 12 is its chorus, resounding with stories of historical faithfulness. While Lawrence thought life could be found outside human society, the writer of Hebrews tells us that it is in the very line or genealogy of the faithful ones that such life can be found with Jesus at its center.

It is not dissimilar to that found in Tolkien’s classic, The Lord of the Rings. What we find in our heroes and martyrs is a living witness (the famous “cloud” of Heb. 12:1) to the fact that the true life of faith can only be nobly inspired and rightly lived if one takes it on bravely and gallantly, as something of a grand adventure in which we set out into an unknown country to face many a danger, to meet many a joy, to find many a comrade, to win and lose many a battle.

Far from being incidental to the life of faith, the element of adventure is as intrinsic to discipleship and community as Jesus designed it to be. When we embrace liminality—that in-between, discomforting place described earlier—and engage it head-on, then we discover the truest sense of adventure. In fact, we will argue, without the adventure we lose the necessary pathos by which we can truly understand the human situation and the meaning of the church. The loss of spiritual adventure produces a somewhat distorted sense of what it means to be in the Way of Jesus—we become bored Christians acquiescing to the lame dictates of a mediocre life, sensing that we are missing out on something important but not willing to pay the price to do anything about it. This is an inauthentic place for any follower of Jesus to be, and nothing could be further from the type of community that Jesus envisioned his church to become.

So we will investigate the dynamics of courage, adventure, mission, and risk—all elements in what we want to put under the general category of “liminality”—and to explore why they are crucial to a genuinely biblical Christianity. But we do so not because we are adrenaline junkies (we are not), but because we believe that there is no way back to radical discipleship and an authentic experience of church without it. Liminality has direct implications for our understanding of theology, philosophy, literature, discipleship, psychology, society, and community.

## The Elements of a Liminal Life

The poet T. S. Eliot suggested that the end of all exploring was to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time. To learn, to grow, to mature, requires a journey from where we are now. And it is only after journeys of exploration that we will return to our most basic of beliefs and really know them personally.

Without such movement there can be no real learning, development, or maturity. Whatever knowledge we might retain in the safe, selfprotective space will end up being merely secondhand, dangerously depersonalized and depersonalizing data—nothing close to the way the Bible sees faith.

## Living Adventurously

By definition, an adventure is a journey with an uncertain outcome. Radical open-endedness has always characterized the human experience, but there can be no doubt it definitely describes our situation in the twenty-first century. We live in an age of considerable uncertainty—who knows what five, ten, twenty years will bring?

The combination of climate change, revolutionary technologies, and massive geopolitical shifts alone are enough to cause overwhelming excitement or anxiety. Then add all the other factors that come into the mix. Because of this global uncertainty, the visionary and the adventurous amongst us will get to shape the future of the twentyfirst century—the church included.

Adventure is an attitude we must apply to the day-to-day obstacles of life—facing new challenges, seizing new opportunities, testing our resources against the unknown, and in the process, discovering our own unique potential as God’s people. Adventure does not consist in something won or lost, enjoyed or endured. Rather, it is the very rhythm of life itself, and acknowledging this transforms mere experience into an adventure. If missional discipleship and community have anything to say to us, it is to call us to precisely this kind of life.

It is not an overstatement to summarize Jesus’s work on earth as that of starting an adventure. Thus we follow Jesus to the extent that we are part of the adventure he started. We fail to follow him to the extent that we check out of this divine drama, this adventure of mission. Note the word began in the following verse from Acts: “In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach” (1:1). He began it; our job is to keep it going.

To follow Jesus fundamentally changes the way we view our lives, the world, and our roles within it. To love God and others opens us up to the full possibilities of life and requires that we enter on a journey in which he leads us into our future. So in many ways it is a matter of perspective—how we perceive our world and our role within it. Or as G. K. Chesterton rightly observed, “An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered.” Much depends on how we perceive life—as threat or opportunity.

We have already referred to the idea of adventure being something of an open-ended journey. It is important to understand what this means and see how it sheds light on the challenges facing Christianity in the twenty-first century. We don’t believe that adventure is simply a vacation, a pilgrimage, or an ordinary journey. In fact, as Samwise Gamgee points out, often we do not choose to undertake an adventure. It chooses us.

Our preferences for stability and security blind us to the opportunities for adventure when they present themselves. Adventures are events, dramas, and stories into which individuals and communities are swept up, their end uncertain and their plot indecipherable. In an adventure, we become players in a larger drama that unfolds as we go. However, there is no real control over the beginning or end of the journey—we must simply choose to see it through or to opt out. And while we cannot fully predict where the adventure will take us, we do get to shape and direct the final outcomes through our action or non-action. Because of all this, an adventure fully engages the adventurer; it is packed with risk and reward, uncertainty and vindication, threat and promise.

All this describes life itself. Life, when viewed as existing between the events of birth and death, and focused to a point, can also be perceived as a journey, an adventure, with a start and an end. Bringing the “religious” element into the equation only massively heightens this sense of adventure.2 In Christ, our actions have eternal consequences, and even the least of us can become spiritual heroes. When Christians lose sight that we live sub specie aeternitatis—under the aspect of eternity—life loses its connection to the grand enfolding narrative, and with that, our sense of purpose and our role in the story, our heroism as it were, is diminished. This reminds one of Kierkegaard’s “knight of faith”—someone who risks all to pursue that which is of infinite, eternal worth.

But adventurers do not only traverse boundaries by themselves— they usually travel with others, and together they return from their adventures with new stories, fresh revelations, and novel perspectives from afar, which in turn change the environment of their homecoming.

It is not hard to see how being incorporated into the gospel story involves us in a grand adventure, where, following the Spirit, we all get to participate with what God is doing in the world. We are all “players” that shape the outcomes through our active involvement with the story as it unfolds through our lives. And given the personal cost of such involvement, many would rather opt out, preferring the static life of middle-class respectability to the wild and erratic undertaking of following Jesus. So we become nostalgic and sentimental, wistfully reflecting on the days of our youthful adventures, feeding off fading memory rather than living in current experience, living in an idealized past rather than facing God’s future. And the biggest mistake in doing this is mistaking this nostalgia for security in God.

In light of God’s claim over our lives, personal security is all an illusion. As Helen Keller observed, “Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.”3 C. S. Lewis addressed this matter of perspective in his characteristically brilliant way during his talk to a group of would-be university students at the beginning of the Second World War.

I think it important to try and see the present calamity in a true perspective. The war creates no absolutely new situation: it simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of the precipice. Human culture has always had to exist under the shadow of something infinitely more important than itself. If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun. We are mistaken when we compare war with "normal life." Life has never been normal.4 When our need for security becomes obsessive, we remove ourselves from the journey of discipleship. By then we have given in to insecurity, and the price is a high one—it becomes an enslaving idol. Making ourselves ever more secure will not keep the fear of insecurity from becoming a possessive demon. The hold of the idol can only be broken by acting directly against it. As French philosopher Jacques Ellul said, "There is an exact equilibrium.

The more security and guarantees we want against things, the less free we are. Tyrants are not to be feared today, but our own frantic need of security is. Freedom inevitably means insecurity and responsibility."5 To use the biblical imagery, we must live in the fear of the Lord and strive against the forces of death. Bunkering down in some sort of false, idolatrous security can only hinder our cause, not advance it.

In this world, there is no such thing as a sure thing. We cannot even control the outcome of a single day. When we think we are in control, we have only bought an illusion. Even if all our efforts go well, the details and all kinds of things that transpire as well as the outcomes will probably be different from what we originally intended anyhow. It’s just the way it is: we can’t control as much as we’d like to suppose.

And so we must go about our pursuits, not resting in some false sense of material security, but responding with faith and trust in Jesus to the onrush of events. We Christians are the great adventurers of the earth, and our lives are crisscrossed everywhere by the characteristics of true adventure. But we only now and then become aware of this fact when something happens to remind us that we are indeed involved in something larger than our self-enclosed concerns—only then does our sense of being on an “adventure” arise. But it is there whether we recognize it or not, and our capacity to “see” this will make the difference of whether we live faithfully or not.

## Courage for the Journey

To be the liminal church that Jesus designed takes real courage.

C. S. Lewis's fictional demon Screwtape advises his nephew Wormwood on the virtue of courage, or the lack thereof:

> In peace we can make many of them [humans] ignore good and evil entirely; in danger, the issue is forced upon them in a guise to which even we cannot blind them. There is here a cruel dilemma before us.
>
> If we promoted justice and charity among men, we should be playing directly into the Enemy's hands; but if we guide them to the opposite behaviour, this sooner or later produces (for He permits it to produce) a war or a revolution, and the undisguisable issue of cowardice or courage awakes thousands of men from moral stupor. This, indeed, is probably one of the Enemy's [God's] motives for creating a dangerous world—a world in which moral issues really come to the point. He sees as well as you do that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions.
>
> Pilate was merciful till it became risky.6 Listen carefully to what is being said here: Lewis is suggesting that courage is the greatest of all virtues, because unless a person possesses that virtue, they have no real capacity for preserving any of the others when it really matters. As he indicates, Pilate was merciful only until it became risky for him to be so. Self-interest and security kicked in and effectively expelled mercy at the point where he was called to actually be merciful. Likewise, people tend to be obedient only up to the point of where it costs them. But this is actually what it means to be cowards—to be unwilling to confront a reasonable degree of fear and anxiety when it matters most.

To live faithfully in this "dangerous world" in which we are called to be the church requires real courage. As theologian Scott Bader-Saye recently wrote, "Courage is the capacity to do what is right and good in the face of fear. We become courageous when we learn to live for something that is more important than our own safety."7 And so when we embrace our calling as courageous adventurers, what needs to be borne in mind? Here are some pointers for would-be voyagers:

1. You cannot really take the risks of obedience if you are not rightly loving the Father, through Jesus, in the power of the Spirit. Adventurous disciples and churches maintain the essential God-relationship by whatever means available.

2. While courage is the antithesis of fear, biblical courage readily embraces the fear of God and refuses the fear of man. To fear God is to respect that which is ultimate and most important, giving us a right perspective and keeping us faithfully on the road. Even death in Jesus's cause is only the beginning of even greater things in God. Remember the martyrs and their witness to us.

3. To obey God is often countercultural, counterintuitive, and requires risk by daring to fly in the face of convention and even of opposition. Unless we are renewing our perspectives with a transcendent biblical perspective (Rom. 12:1–3), we'll probably buckle under the pressure and give way to the ambient call of the world.

4. Recognize that God is the sovereign King who is directing all things to a final goal when he will be all in all (1 Cor. 15:28). At one point or another, each of us will think that this is not the case, so we have to constantly remind each other of this truth.

5. Courage finds its greatest expression in love and sacrifice. It is that point where we can be sure we are in the faith (1 John 3). When we really love, consistently and in Jesus's name, we are being as courageous as we are ever expected to be.

## Embracing Risk

When we began our research into the link between adventure, God, and the church, we found that no sustained academic work had been previously written on the subject. Books that explore a theology of risk, adventure, and courage simply do not exist. This is surprising, given the surfeit of material written on more peripheral theological matters, and it is a huge indicator of how lackluster, nonmissional, and passive our thinking about the Trinity, church, and discipleship have become.

The closest we could find to a theology of risk comes from the controversial area of “open theism,” a theological movement that has developed within evangelical and post-evangelical Protestant Christianity in response to the infusion of Hellenistic ideas into Western Christian theology. Examples of such a fusion of ideas within classical theism are, among others, the teaching that God is immutable (unmoving/unchangeable), impassible (without passion/emotion), and timeless (in the sense of completely ahistorical).

Furthermore it asserts that God fully predetermines the future; thus, humanity does not have free will, or if free, we are free only within the highly conditioned boundaries of God’s predetermining will and action. Open theists reject this “closed view of God” and argue that these attributes do not belong to the God of the Bible and are at odds with personhood (and the human reflection and image of God) in general.8 It is beyond our scope and expertise to present or even critique this debate; we simply note here that while open theism is willing to admit that risk happens both within God and to God, classical theism seems to exclude this on principle.

To our minds at least, the freedom and contingency that God grants to his creation must in some way imply risk; otherwise, the concept of freedom has no inherent reality and meaning. For instance, to love in any sense of the word means choosing to be open in some sense to pain and loss, and therefore risk. And it does appear that the God of Revelation loves in this way: he feels very deeply the lostness of his creation. It also recognizes that in the Incarnation, God must have taken some significant risk related to the humanity of Jesus because to be truly human means to be subject to some form of finitude, to lack the comprehensive vision, power, and knowledge that is required to make risk-free choices. The early church considered heresy anything that diminished the authentic humanity of Jesus (e. g., docetism, gnosticism, etc.) and rightly so. Our understanding of the Incarnation and the salvation gained through Jesus is at stake here.

Furthermore, it seems correct to say that God took something of a risk in handing over his mission to the all-too-sinful human beings who were the original disciples—and all the sinful disciples beyond them. We wonder what Jesus must have been thinking on the cross, when all but a few powerless women had completely abandoned him.

Did he wonder if love alone was enough to draw them back into discipleship? The noncoercive love of the cross necessitated a genuinely human response of willing obedience from his disciples. Given our predispositions to rebellion and idolatry, it is entirely conceivable that history could have gone in a completely different, indeed totally disastrous, direction if the original disciples hadn’t plucked up the internal courage to follow Jesus no matter where. They took on the adventure of discipleship in response to the risky love that God had bestowed upon them in Jesus. There were no risk-free scenarios here, no guarantees that they would make the right choices. If this is not the case, then we are not human precisely at the point where we must be most completely human: in freely offering our lives back to God in love and adoration. This assumes that it might not have been so, or else the choice for Jesus is no choice at all.

Given the narrative structure of the Bible, we can also state that God is an adventurer. He is the subject of a living Story still being told. He extends himself, actively engaging in all sorts of historical events—war, peace, judgment, redemption, salvation, etc. He feels deeply the events of the world. The Bible is full of phrases that describe God’s pathos arising from his involvement in human history.

He initiates events, he responds to human concerns, he sings, weeps, cajoles, and gets angry. Furthermore, in response to the sinful human condition, he “sends” his Son and Spirit on a (still ongoing) mission to redeem the world.

But any theology of adventure must also take eschatology seriously.

Indeed, it is inherent in any attempt to comprehend God and the teachings of the Bible. Take eschatology out of the equation and you end up with a completely distorted view of the biblical revelation.

In fact, it can’t be understood at all.

When we look into the nature of eschatology, we will find a theological structure that gives us a conceptual framework within which to understand the ongoing adventure of the church. Even a cursory reading of the book of Revelation gives us a sense of the ultimate meaning of events and our role within them. Here we see the crashing in of the kingdom of God, creating urgency, demanding change, calling us forward to a vision of what will be when the Messiah returns.

Just as the Pevensie children find themselves in the middle of a war when in Narnia, those who repent and turn to Jesus are automatically co-opted into the revolution that he started. The kingdom of God is a crash-bang opera: the King is dramatic, demanding, and unavoidable.

But that’s not the whole truth about the kingdom. It also intrudes into our world and works on us secretly and subversively—like yeast working its way through dough, like seeds stealthily growing into trees, like wheat growing quietly in a field. It is present right here, right now, and yet needs to be completely fulfilled, and sometimes one can be forgiven for thinking that it had never arrived at all. But we Christians know that it has. It is our D-day to the ever-encroaching V-day. The war is won in Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection, but there are still many battles to be fought. This subversive kingdom undermines the status quo, creates spiritual unrest, breaks hard hearts, and instills righteousness. Like pilgrims in a strange land, we are called to the Journey, to be great adventurers, the eschatological people of God. We are secret agents; we are in the middle of an assignment, engaged on that grand Adventure.

Eschatology therefore not only gives us an external framework to understand the adventure of the church but provides us with an inbuilt theological mechanism that creates a constant, unrelenting, deeply internalized theological pressure on the community of faith.

This in itself provides us with an internal liminality, because it urgently presses us toward adaptation to a vision of what can be and is not yet. When our life here strikes us as a mere preliminary phase in the fulfillment of eternal destinies, when we have no home but merely a temporary asylum on earth, we get the feeling that life as a whole is an adventure.9 Vision changes us, but a kingdom vision changes everything.

The “not yet” aspect of the kingdom of God means that the Acts of the Apostles is still being written by the church in every age, including the contemporary one. Not in the way that it is canonical and authoritative to be sure, but nonetheless every bit as valid and authentic as the early church. The revolution of Jesus marches on— the job is not yet complete—and we remain in the ranks of those who have heeded the call. As Martin Luther suggests, the church should live its life as if Jesus died yesterday, rose from the dead today, and is coming back tomorrow.

## Mission as a Liminal Space

We mentioned earlier that we believe that mission is one of the elements of liminality. By that we mean that mission, by its very nature, creates the conditions of liminality. If mission involves alerting others to the universal reign of God through Christ,10 then we need to recognize that this reign is not only disputed, it is rejected by the vast majority of people—this alone puts us at odds with what is considered real and normal. Furthermore, while the kingdom has been inaugurated in the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus (it is full, complete, and irreversible), it is not yet fully consummated, and so we live in an in-between time, a time after its inauguration and its completion in the return of Christ. By its very nature then, mission (especially evangelistic mission) is a liminal activity. It sits between what is and what is to come.

Jesus himself referred to us being “in the world but not of the world” (John 17:11, 16), as good a liminal expression as you’ll find.

We don’t belong in the world as it is now. Our destiny lies in the world to come, but like Frodo and his companion in the Lord of the Rings, we press on in this journey, knowing our function here is not merely to endure but to effect change in Jesus’s name as commanded by the King whose reign we announce and demonstrate.

But more than this, there is a sense of mission as a liminal activity when brave followers of King Jesus step out of the supposedly safe haven of the church into the world to love and serve others as a demonstration of his reign and to share the good news of that reign with them. Mission is risky, requiring us to step into the unknown with little more than a commitment to the vision of what Jesus wants from his world.

Therefore, missional living is carried out the liminal reality in which the church currently finds itself and requires a sense of risk and adventure to ensure its success.

## Cultivating a Holy Urgency

One of the key benefits of putting a theology of adventure back into our venture of church is that it creates a right sense of holy urgency needed for us to learn and adapt to changing conditions.

Our best eschatology teaches us that there is no time when this has been more important than right now. Spiritual urgency, the kind of which imbues the prophetic writings, involves a heightened sense of spiritual intelligence combined with passion to focus the mind as fully as possible on the issues and challenges at hand.

Asense of holy urgency is vital to church life because it creates the right sense of immediacy to provoke holy action. It is through holy urgency that we overcome unholy complacency. When imbued with an appropriate sense of urgency, people and churches become alert and proactive, seeking information relative to development and success of their mission. In other words, they become a learning organization—highly adaptive and responsive to the changing conditions around them.

John Kotter, Professor of Leadership Emeritus at Harvard Business School and the author of several books on leadership and change, enumerated in his landmark book, Leading Change, eight necessary steps for bringing significant and lasting change to an organization.11 The first of these steps was to create a sense of urgency and lace it throughout the organization. Over the years, as he further studied change in organizations, he came to the conclusion that the lack of a sense of urgency accounted for 70 percent of all major change efforts failing or being completed significantly behind schedule or over budget. So, sensing the strategic nature of the issue, his latest book focuses on specific tactics to develop and maintain a suitable sense of urgency to enable significant change.12 Of what relevance is this to the church?

First, Kotter rightly names the lack of urgency as the leading reason for lack of movement. Most people experience church as a rather static affair. Church leaders know full well how hard it is to regain momentum once things have settled down. Asense of urgency tends to collapse after relative successes have been achieved.13 Complacency must surely account for much (not all) of the spiritual and numerical decline we are experiencing at the moment. Complacency, the opposite of urgency, involves being content with the status quo. In the fast-changing world in which we are destined to live out our calling to be the church, this can be disaster. This is especially important given the systematic decline of Christianity throughout the Western world—this is no time for being sinfully smug.

The adventurous church thrives on a sense of holy urgency, and missional movements are built on it. Says Kotter, "If the sense of urgency is not high enough and complacency is not low enough, everything else that we seek to do will become much more difficult."14 I ronically enough, it is because of our successes that we can so easily slip into complacency. And it doesn't have to be recent success; we have a long tradition of basking in old revivals. Kotter continues, "Urgency leads to success, leads to complacency. At no time are these natural forces stronger than after people have worked very hard and have been rewarded by a visible, unambiguous win."15 Take for instance the world of sport: in rugby (which both of us love), the time when the team is most vulnerable is immediately after they have scored against their opponents.

According to Kotter, leaders who are successful in creating a missional urgency will utilize the following behaviors:16 They create emotionally compelling experiences. When engendering authentic, deeply grounded spiritual urgency, missional leaders should aim for the heart. I ntellectual affirmation of ideas is simply not enough, nor are philosophy statements, endless white papers, or mere talk. True urgency involves the heart, engaging people holistically with a passionate and compelling determination to move, and succeed, now. "The challenge is to fold a rational case directed toward the mind into an experience that is very much aimed at the heart."17 They model urgency in their behavior on an ongoing basis. As is the case in any set of core values, they are better modeled than discussed. Never underestimate the sheer moral power of a person living their philosophy. In the hands of good leadership, it’s contagious, and it’s the best way to change organizational behaviors. Asense of urgency provides a viable mechanism with which to discern what is necessary and what is not. Keeping this up on a daily basis will model the culture you wish to embed.

They look for the possibilities in crises. Auseful crisis creates a situation that cannot be resolved by incremental change. When one is on a “burning platform,” the crisis causes one to move, looking for an opportunity. Control systems are important, but don’t let damage control eliminate an opportunity to mobilize needed action. Acrisis can be used to create urgency and to position an organization for the future. Fear and anger can kill hope. The heart needs hope in order to act with passion, conviction, optimism, and resolve.18 If external events do not create a crisis, it must fall to leadership to create the appropriate conditions for urgency. However, discernment is needed here.

Whatever we create must be associated with real missional problems, and not just be a ploy.19 They confront naysayers effectively. Naysayers are highly skilled urgency killers, and the church is full of them. They can be powerful barriers to missional engagement and progress. They are not true skeptics, who serve a good purpose by curbing naive enthusiasm and can be convinced by evidence. Rather, naysayers will discredit people and derail the process. They continue to question the information and demand more proof.

They disrupt useful conversation and cause delay and frustration. You can’t ignore them. You can’t co-opt them. You must distract them, push them out of the organization, or expose their behaviors in a socially acceptable way so that social pressure will shut them down.

They keep urgency urgent. Speaking of organizations in general, Kotter says, “With a culture of urgency, people deeply value the capacity to grab new opportunities, avoid new hazards, and continually find ways to win. Behaviors that are the norm include being constantly alert, focusing externally, moving fast, stopping low-value-added activities that absorb time and effort, relentlessly pushing for change when it is needed, and providing the leadership to produce smart change no matter where you are in the hierarchy.”20 The ultimate solution to the problem of spiritual complacency is to create a systematically embedded culture of holy urgency. This holy urgency is not to be confused with the frenzied activity that tyrannizes and drives so many people and makes them sick; rather, it arises from that sense of holiness that is a necessary prerequisite for godly change. Things are wrong and need to be put right, and the time is now. We are to put our lives in God’s hands. Such holy urgency involves the faith of leap, because it recognizes that while we are part of the problem, we are also part of the solution, and we are called to immediate action in our lives and communities. Redemption is seeking to take place in and through us, and we must cooperate with it. And repentance is always required in the here and now.

## Leading in Liminality

It’s commonly understood that an extreme situation can call forth either cowardice or heroism from the very people you would least expect it. There’s nothing like a good crisis to reveal the character of the soul or an organization. When one is leading because one’s life, and the lives of others, depends on it, then perhaps the best qualities of leadership shine through. This is particularly true when it comes to the issue of leadership and leadership development—strategic areas of focus for the missional church.

Clearly, leading in a life-or-death situation is different from managing in more routine, or even in crisis, circumstances. US Marine Colonel Thomas Kolditz did a unique, long-term study on the nature of leadership in precisely such conditions. In spite of the extreme nature of the research, we believe that his findings on what he calls in extremis leaders has clear relevance for those of us who are involved in leading the church through times of massive upheaval and change.

His insights are important affirmations as we factor adventure and liminality in the equation of leadership in the church. They include among others, that

- In extremis leaders are inherently motivated because of the danger

of the situations in which they’re working; therefore, leaders don’t need to use conventional motivational methods or cheerleading....

- In extremis leaders embrace continuous learning, typically because

they and their followers need to rapidly scan their environments to determine the level of threat and danger they’re facing....

- In extremis leaders share the risk their followers face. This isn’t just

grandstanding; leaders truly share—and even take on greater— risks in in extremis situations. Leaders in other environments should keep this in mind: don’t ask your followers to do anything you wouldn’t do yourself.

- In extremis leaders share a common lifestyle with their followers.... all leaders should consider how much they truly have in common with the rest of their organization. [For instance, the issue of highly unequal pay scales does say something about the nature of leadership.]...

- Dangerous situations demand a high level of mutual trust. In extremis leaders trust their team, and they themselves can be trusted.

And even if someone’s life isn’t at stake in an organization, his or her livelihood may be, so do everything you can to be trustworthy and to trust your team to do what [they are chosen] to do.

- High-risk environments demand mutual loyalty between leader

and followers.... Leaders should do everything they can to foster a culture of mutual loyalty.21 Extrapolating from this, we can say that in situations when our lives (or organizations or careers) are at risk, general principles from standard management practice need to be sharpened and their relative degree of importance modified. First, for Kolditz, the most crucial factor for the in extremis leader is to concentrate on the external environment and learn from it what action to take, rather than focus on motivating his/her team.

Alan was watching a documentary on World War II recently. One of the interviewees, Richard Trigaskis, a war correspondent assigned to the front, made this startling comment that highlights how external threat can hone the senses and focus the mind: “There is just something about being in the middle of a battle—alive, yet inches from death. The thought of the danger itself stirs the imagination.” As weird as it sounds to those of us more accustomed to a safer form of church leadership, the intensity of an external threat itself energizes those exposed to it. This should sound familiar to leaders who understand fully the external, and oftentimes threatening, mission context around them.

Second, we want to affirm that adventurous leaders must be willing to share with their followers in the risks with which they are confronted, rather than look for cover. Instead of adopting the aloof, hierarchical, top-down approach to leadership, we should, like the biblical leaders (Moses, David, Jesus, Paul), lead from the front and not from the rear. The way we said this in Forge Mission Training Network, for instance, is that the teacher must also be a practitioner.

We must all have a hand in, and a direct stake in, the ideas that we are proclaiming—we must be personally risking and experiencing what we are calling others to do. Our capacity to be inspirational leaders, not simply transactional ones, hinges on this.

This also applies to the degree with which we identify with the life and experience of followers. We cannot be, or even seem to be, motivated by money and personal prestige. Kolditz reminds us, “Leadership is about the success of your people, not about you.”22 He’s right: authentic missional leadership emphasizes the development of hope, resilience, and optimism within a highly ethical framework.

“To be a leader is not to hold down a position or perform a job: it is to develop a character that is inextricably linked to giving purpose, motivation, and direction to others.”23 Therefore the “impression management” so many church leaders fall prey to, which is intended to make sure that the leader appears to be selfless, concerned, and humble, is doomed to fail. And so is leader development training that focuses solely on knowledge, skills (such as decision making, communication, and planning), and abilities. In liminal situations, character matters supremely. In the church where Jesus is Lord, it is of supreme importance, and it is based squarely on the model of leadership that he provides for us.

This is not to say that skill isn’t important; liminal leaders need to be highly competent (and perceived as such) so as to engender the team’s trust and loyalty. And the capacity to critically analyze a situation and respond quickly is a fundamental aspect of all leadership. Given the nature of liminal situations, missional leaders need to know how to assess risk and determine when to halt an activity and walk away—and not be afraid to tell the truth about it—and when to continue such activity. The same honest self-critical analysis should also apply when there has been a major performance failure, so as to find and correct systemic weaknesses throughout the organization, not just the initially affected area.24 Our own approach to leadership development squares with what can be learned from the in extremis situation. At Forge we took the view that leadership development for a more liminal adventuresome church will go beyond mere theological ideas and ministry skills by

1. emphasizing leader-follower training in live-action contexts;
2. using a primarily inspirational and secondarily informational

approach;

3. telling stories of real situations, particularly about what emerging leaders will be facing immediately after graduation;

4. providing peer-to-peer mentoring and sharing of knowledge,

5. studying not only historical cases but also “live” cases.

> The Upside of Down: The By-Products of Liminality

All this talk about adventure, risk, and in extremis leadership sounds pretty exhausting. But these are the necessary elements of liminality—that neither-here-nor-there place to which the church is called.

The church can neither retreat to safe institutionalization nor abandon its faith altogether. It is called out—out beyond itself into the liminal place of mission. Such a neither-here-nor-there space calls forth a capacity for relentless change. It forces us to be a constantly learning community, with agility and a propensity for risk-taking and movement. And shouldn’t anyone related to the Holy God that we worship be in a continual state of change? To know God is to change. Besides, human maturity is predicated on our continued willingness to learn and to grow. But we don’t want to give the false impression that change, journey, and liminality always involve death-defying deeds to qualify for a genuine gospel adventure. Acts of love and mercy themselves embody courage and advance the cause of Jesus in our world.

For all the insecurity that an adventurous Christianity-of-theRoad brings, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Conversely, in the nonadventurous, supposedly more secure life, the costs far outweigh the advantages. The loss of pathos, authenticity, and living reality to our faith and experience of Jesus’s church is a high price to pay for comfort and convenience. Alife lived in fear is a life half lived.

Likewise, a church addicted to security and safety is not the church of Jesus Christ; it is in reality something else.

But a sense of urgency can create a honed intelligence and receptivity to change. It seems that this is the case when God's people find themselves on the edges of the norm, in places of liminality, living within an Adventure that is unfolding as they act in it. As the writer of Hebrews pointed out to his predominantly Jewish readership, true faith emerges when people are confronted by liminal experiences, be it Abraham and his journeys, Joseph in jail, Moses and the burning bush, the Exodus events and the associated Sinai revelations, Elijah in the desert, David on the run or at war, the Babylonian captivity, Jesus and his community, the book of Acts, Paul's journeys, Peter's letters to the "exiles," John's banishment on Patmos, and so forth.

Revelation downloads and theology is at its densest when we are receptive to God because of conditions of spiritual extremity, urgency, and liminality.

Extreme conditions are nothing new to God’s people. Consider Augustine’s emotional liminality before God, the sheer daring of the amazing Celtic missionaries, Luther and his reforms, Francis passionately forsaking comfort to be with the poor and his brave mission to the Muslim world, Wesley and his journeys, the monastic mystics in their extreme states, Hudson Taylor pioneering the inland mission in China, Livingston in Africa, the liminal outcasts of the Azusa Street revival that sparked a worldwide movement of 500 million people.

These are all situations when people and movements experienced the Holy Spirit in profound, history-altering ways, the fruits of which have added to the inherited wisdom of all God’s people.

Following this, we can therefore say on principle that those who, prompted by God and gospel, and following Jesus, push out into the unknown in the holy quest for a better world will know God more profoundly than those who stay behind.

The idea of progress is predicated on the assumption that we have not arrived at a state of perfection, that we need to strive toward more faithful ways of being the church. Aholy unrest therefore lies at the root of the church’s progress. In fact, all renewal originates from the sense that there is more to this than we are currently experiencing; it is a gracious work of the Holy Spirit to awaken us to this need.

The people who respond can rightly be called pioneers and saints.

Jewish theologian Louis Jacobs puts it this way: So it has been throughout the ages. Progress has been possible only because of the heroic efforts of ardent pioneers who dared everything in obedience to the voice of God. At first they were ridiculed, condemned, and persecuted, while those who benefitted from their selfsacrifice and devotion looked on without making the slightest effort to help. Only after victory had been won, did these others begin to tread with ease the path smoothed for them in anguish and with tears.25 Becoming an adventurous, liminal church means getting over risk aversion. Often the difference between a successful person (or organization) and a failure lies not in having better abilities or ideas, but in having the courage to bet on one’s ideas, to take a calculated risk—and to act.26 Risk-ability is vital to learning and innovation.

## The Burning Platform

Innovation usually arises out of a sense of need, even desperation, as organizations strive to keep the edge. Living systems theory maintains, rightly, that the sweet spot of innovation takes place on “the edge of chaos,” or on what is called “a burning platform”—a situation where the organization is threatened with possible dissolution.

For instance, Donald Kuratko notes that certain environmental factors cause entrepreneurs to emerge. One major factor is displacement—political, cultural, economic, and geographical.27 Being placed into radically new contexts requires an almost total relearning of everything we thought we knew—for example, when one goes to a completely foreign culture. This in turn can trigger the entrepreneurial spirit, because such displacement puts a person and an organization in an environment that creates the possibility of “opportunity recognition.” One of the rules of innovation is Think like a beginner, not an expert—a precursor to innovation.

When we started Forge Mission Training Network, we recognized the desperate need for entrepreneurial gifting to help us get beyond the current missional impasse in the West. So we developed a philosophy of education that incorporated a lively sense of innovation and entrepreneurship. We didn’t have to look far to find a profound way to engender innovation in our interns; in fact, we found it all within the educational philosophy inherent in discipleship itself. For us it meant putting our interns “at risk.” If they are standing within their current realm of expertise, then they are only going to learn what they already know, or perhaps even confirm their ignorance.

So the learners take one step out of their comfort zone, closer to the edge of chaos, and then another half step so they are “at risk” of real failure. This set the agenda for the learning journey over the next year. If the liminal situation can be sustained, then real, lasting, paradigm-shifting learning will occur. And hey, Jesus did this exceptionally well with his mob of half-baked disciples.

I nherent in the vocation of discipleship is the call to the kind of extreme liminality that a cross will bring (see Matt. 10:38–39; 16:24–25). In principle, all disciples are meant to integrate this upon their decision to follow Jesus. He warns his disciples of persecution (Matt. 5:11; Luke 21:12; John 12:25) and troubles, but our Lord has overcome it, and so have we in him (John 16:33). Liminality is locked into the equation from the very beginning so that we should not need convincing later on. We are people who have died to our own agenda, we belong to Jesus and his cause (1 Cor. 6:20), we are his servants (Rom. 6:20–22) and ambassadors (2 Cor. 5:20), and we must run for the prize (1 Cor. 9:24) and prepare ourselves for our calling with the discipline of a soldier (2 Tim. 2:3–4). In short, he is the Lord—we are not in control; he is.

This is the fellowship of the King, the people of the cross. The Greek word for witness is marturion and lies at the root of the English word for martyr, thus uniting the idea of witness with potential suffering and even death for the person and cause of Jesus.

If suffering should come our way (and we would hope it doesn’t), we trust that we too would be found faithful. What we know from sisters and brothers who do suffer persecution is that they cling to Jesus and to community in ways we can only dream about. Atruth that is suffered for is a personal truth.

It takes a healthy community to endure persecution. In his reflections on friendship and risk, Paul Waddell makes the observation that “it is much easier to take the risk of loving someone when we know we are loved and cherished by another.”28 In other words, the presence of a loving, witnessing community makes it easier to take the risk of extending love to someone outside the community, even when it is dangerous for us to do so. All this leads Scott Bader-Saye to say, “There can be no solution to the problem of fear without the existence of communities capable of bearing fear together.”29 Jesus Is My Disequilibrium Where Friends Become Comrades

> Humans are inherently social creatures, and as such we learn everything—by being with, observing, and modeling other people. The virtues are learned by being with other people who help us to become good. As theologian Scott Bader-Saye puts it, "Virtues are learned by being with others who embody the virtues."

We learn to be virtuous by seeing virtuous people act in virtuous ways. Lacking the community in which the virtues are being sought and lived, one would be hard pressed to develop any of the virtues, including courage.1

> But the contemporary church, by not being a place of courage and adventure, perpetuates a moral anxiety that fosters an awkwardness toward its wider community. Many church folk, in their self-conscious anxiety, thus mess with people's perception of the gospel. Says Alison Milbank, "Anxiety... means that insofar as we do engage with the world out of fear—afraid for our children, we strive to uphold the moral standards of the world, afraid of stories about wizards. The result is that we keep our moral and spiritual lives private, and the church becomes a retreatist, frightened community, private clubs for those whose leisure interest is religion."3 Church communities that are risk-averse become inward, and become content with self-preservation. When churches fail to provide the kind of community that enables individuals to develop a more adventurous form of discipleship, they "cannot provide the resources for any courageous action."4
>
> We need to be telling and celebrating the stories of the martyrs, especially the ones that suffered for their cause—because "they embodied the courage of the martyr," as Bader-Saye puts it. "[The martyrs] recognized that discipleship would require risk, but they did not step back from it. They lived for something bigger than themselves, and they were sustained by communities that not only taught faithfulness. They were sustained by communities that not only taught them the faith but also embodied it. The courage of the martyr relies upon the courage of the community that dares to be telling and celebrating their stories."5

We were always meant to venture out, but we were never meant to do it alone. When Jesus kicked off the mission that we are continuing now, he didn’t commission rugged, individualistic swashbucklers haphazardly forging their own destinies in life, but rather he initiated a movement destined to be the community of the faithful who are in the end found worthy to worship before the throne (Rev. 21). It is a widely recognized fact that Westerners tend to distort Jesus’s intent by reading the Bible as written to, and about, individuals. Not so.

The Bible is written to communities, be it Israel or the church, and it is written to foster community, whether it be the national identity of Israel or the faith community of the church. Just as there is no such thing as an Israel-less Jew, there is no such thing as a churchless Christian (1 Cor. 12:13). Our very identity as God’s people is bound up in the collective identity of being an ecclesia—a group of people called, named, redeemed, ruled, and loved by Jesus (Rom. 1:1–3; Eph. 4; Col. 1:1–3; 1 Peter 2:9–10; Rev. 1–3). We are never going to be the church that Jesus built if we do not take community seriously.

In The Forgotten Ways Alan suggests that missional movements that actually transform their world comprised a dynamic network of communities that overcome their innate human instinct to “huddle and cuddle” and form themselves around a common mission that calls them onto a dangerous journey to unknown places. Movements happen when the church manages to shake off its collective fears and plunges into the mission of God in the world, where, while experiencing liminality and disorientation, they also get to encounter God and each other in a new way. Similarly, in Exiles, Michael explores the relationship of discipleship and community in calling us to live as exiles—followers of Jesus who operate from the margins of culture and, because of liminal circumstance, are recovering a much more biblical form of community. Either way, we were trying to describe the kind of community that is able to integrate adventure and movement, a community that experiences a togetherness that only happens among people inspired by the vision of a better world and attempting to do something about it. The name we gave to the communal phenomenon that forms in adventurous mission and liminal discipleship is communitas.6 Allow us to briefly reintroduce the term here. The best way to think about it is to imagine the kind of band of companions that form in the context of adventure, around a common ordeal, a challenge, a task, or in pursuit of a mission. This entry into a verge-like experience is called liminality. Liminality, remember, involves adventure, risk, journey, engagement, and courage and was explored as the subject of the previous chapter. When liminality “happens” (it can be deliberately cultivated), it fundamentally restructures the nature of preexisting relationships, friendships emerge from mere associations, and comradeship evolves from preexisting friendships.

Being immersed in a communitas, participants experience an almost mystical togetherness that only occurs among a group of people engaging in a task bigger than itself. Adifferent genre of love emerges from the experience of communitas—one that cannot emerge in the more static form of associations. The bonding is deep; people get to need each other, they get to know and rely on each other. They have to (sometimes for sheer survival), to overcome the liminal challenge in whatever form it is experienced.

Keep in mind that there is a direct and indissoluble link between liminality and communitas; they are two sides of the same coin.

Unfortunately, we can’t have the one without the other. Therefore we will often join the two terms (liminality-communitas) to ensure that we appreciate the necessary dialectic inherent between the two aspects.

We cannot shake the impression that the church Jesus built was meant to experience this form of togetherness... and lots of it. And not just for the sake of love and fellowship, but because we have a mission that requires it! Mission propels us out of self-concern to other-concern, from holy huddle to venturing out into God’s world.

And mission, encapsulating as it does the purpose of the church, has always been vital to the equation of ecclesia that Jesus intended in the first place—it goes to the reason of why we exist at all! Much more is gathered up in this topic than we might first imagine.
