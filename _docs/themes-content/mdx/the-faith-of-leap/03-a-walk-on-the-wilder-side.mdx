# Chapter 3: A Walk on the Wilder Side: Overcoming Fear in Pursuit of Wild Hope

He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.

—Paul Tillich

The true understanding of the Bible is that it tells us a story of which my life is a part, the story of God's tireless, loving, wrathful, inexhaustible patience with the human family, and of our unbelief, blindness, disobedience. To accept this story as the truth of the human story (and so my story) commits me personally to a life of discernment and obedience in the new circumstances of each day.

—Lesslie Newbigin

This submission to the threshold of a cross is at the very root of our following Jesus; it changes the game completely. Now discipleship is not about mere attendance in church meetings, it is about how we develop, mature, learn, adapt, and relate to God. It is about divesting oneself of allegiance to a religious system or institution and embracing the freedom of having nothing to lose. Much of who we are as Jesus’s people will depend largely on the quality of our discipleship. A church as Jesus defined it ought to be comprised of disciples and not just admirers, or it hardly is a church.

## The Faith of Leap

Philosopher George Santayana wrote, "We don't know who discovered water, but we know it wasn't fish!" Because fish know nothing but water, they would have nothing to compare it to, no other frame of reference, that would help them describe it. Likewise, it seems that defining the nature of faith itself is somewhat difficult for us, because it is just assumed in the God relationship and is therefore largely cognitively invisible to us. What actually is faith? And how do we exercise it in ways that change us and the world? Theologians have long pondered this, and many embrace the Reformation theology's definition of a multilayered phenomenon comprising:

1. recognition of certain facts about God, the world, self, etc. (notitia);
2. the confession of the truth of those facts and that they are somehow authoritative for us (assensus); and
3. existentially trusting ourselves to the promises and claims of God that we find in them (fiducia).

> The first two levels, while necessary, require little from us in terms of personal commitment. Even if facts, theological or otherwise, do imply a certain obligation to live according to them, they don't require us to actually do so. People can live whole lifetimes accumulating facts about God and living lives that acknowledge these facts from "the top of the head" rather than as a response from the heart. But knowledge alone, even knowledge acknowledged at the judgment seat, is never going to save anyone. James says, "You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder" (2:19). Even knowing truths about God is not enough—we must actively risk ourselves to the truth that we believe is true, staking our lives on the promises of God.

Seen in this light, faith is the exciting venture in which we bet that God really is—that this is his world, and that he is like Jesus Christ, and that he saves those who love him with their lives! It is therefore correct to say, with Elton Trueblood, that “faith is not belief without proof, but is trust without reservation.” Therefore faith is more an act of courage than it is an act of knowledge.

We follow Blaise Pascal’s dictum that faith is not lazy acceptance of dogma but rather something more akin to a gamble.2 It is the essence of a gamble that the gambler either wins or loses—he is either right or wrong. We must make our most fundamental decisions in risk, without certain knowledge—we do not see the faces of the cards. This is what it means to “believe.” It is the supreme “gamble.” C. S. Lewis could say, “If I am sure of anything I am sure that His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities.”3 Or as David Bosch put it, “Mission is, quite simply, the participation of Christians in the liberating mission of Jesus, wagering on a future that verifiable experience seems to belie.”4 Indeed it is the ultimate wager. Elton Trueblood can therefore rightly say, “Faith, when we think about it, is not merely intellectual assent to a set of propositions, but the supreme gamble in which we stake our lives upon a conviction: It is closer to courage than it is to mere belief.”5 It is no different when it comes to all our endeavors, including leadership, ministry, and mission, in the world. David Bosch continues, “[Mission]... is an altogether ambivalent enterprise executed in the context of tension between divine providence and human confusion. The Church’s involvement in mission remains an act of faith without earthly guarantees.”6 All this to highlight how foundational, indeed how primal, risk and courage are to faith itself. And how basic this faith is to salvation, discipleship, spirituality, knowledge of God, and maturity. How is it that we think we can eliminate courage from the Christian life and ever hope to remain faithful? How is it that churches can justify making “safe spaces” by removing faithful risk (fiducia) from the equation, substituting it with a whole lot of knowledge (notitia and assensus), and hope to fulfill the revolutionary commission that we all live under? Martin Luther would be rightfully enraged, because this is what he fought against.

## Putting Fear into Perspective

Scott Bader-Saye has written an excellent, timely, and somewhat uniquebook on the role of fear in culture and in the life of faith.7 What at first seems like such an odd topic turns out to be a very important one as we tackle the nature of discipleship and witness in our time. The reality is that fear is endemic to the human condition, and while that has always been the case, the culture of fear in which we live actually drives us more than we think. Marketers sell us products that appeal to the economics of fear; and in a post–9/11 world, we are equally driven by the politics of fear. Christians, insofar as we are influenced by the culture in which we live, are certainly not immune. In fact, we seem to exhibit little difference from the non-Christians around about us—and it is not doing our witness much good.

Recently Alan had a startling conversation with two good friends, who driven by long-term, unnamed, unresolved anxieties, have taken refuge in what can only be called an attitude of fear and loathing.

This manifested in a vitriolic denunciation of illegal immigrants, the refusal to connect with standard wireless internet for fear that someone will maliciously download pornography on their computers, and withdrawal of all their money from the banks. According to these deeply intelligent, sincere, spiritual people, everything has become a conspiracy of socialists, the feds, Obama, European liberals, Muslims, whoever. They believe that America will be forced to split into three separate nations through the activities of the various secessionist movements operating throughout the American Midwest—some of which, according to them, were even considering the possibility of an overthrow, a coup d’état no less, of the American government!

And so the conversation went, most of it deeply irrational and fueled by more homegrown conspiracy theories than you can poke a stick at. Seriously! If the dollar/currency collapses and the banks all close, as they so confidently predict, then cash itself will be worthless because the very concept of money presupposes a functioning economy in the first place! What use will having all your cash stashed under the bed be if it has no value as a means of exchange? Not to mention training one’s lovely Christian daughter to use a gun to blow away anyone who gets close to her stash of food and water. Think about that for a while—killing someone because they are thirsty!

Bader-Saye is right that suspicion becomes a virtue in the culture of fear. If we assume that we are always “at risk,” we will always treat others as potential threats.8 Surely this is the kind of “compound mentality” that motivates and energizes cults? Think David Koresh! Ponder the mentality of the Kool-Aid drinkers here. And we have to ask, where exactly is the redeeming power of Jesus in all this? Where is the trust in the gospel’s power to overcome sin and despair and the associated call to live confidently in the love of God (Eph. 3:1–21)? What of being willing to give one’s life in his name and cause?

This fear-driven paranoia could be dismissed as lunatic fringe except that the two people in view are seriously high-profile, well-regarded Christian leaders! And while they might be on the edge of "normal" in this regard, they do in fact represent something of a mindset evident to greater or lesser degrees throughout American church culture.

While fear is a really dangerous thing, it is not evil in itself. It is not wrong to have fears, it is just plain human. But make no mistake: excessive, or what theologians call disordered, fear, if not prayerfully brought under Jesus's centering lordship, can lead us directly to vices such as cowardice, apathy, rage, and violence. If left unchecked, untamed fear always draws upon the irrational, evil-tinged sides of human nature. It is not too much to claim that genocides are largely motivated by unresolved fears and anxieties. Theologian Ted Peters, following thinkers like Soren Kierkegaard, Karl Barth, and others, places unresolved fear (of loss, death, possessions, the other, etc.) and unnamed anxieties at the root of all sin and evil—and not without some justification.9 Fear causes a kind of contraction of the heart. As such, it inhibits godly actions such as love, hospitality, risky mission, and generosity. For instance, by imagining some future evil, fear draws us in on ourselves so that we refuse to "extend" to people or causes that require sacrifice and risk. This, in turn, becomes a direct barrier to Christian discipleship, which calls us not to contract but to expand, not to limit ourselves to a few things but to open ourselves lovingly and generously to many things, not to attack that which threatens us, but to love even an enemy.10 Peters writes:

> Fear is a moral issue in so far as it shapes the kind of people we become, and the kind of people we become has a lot to do with how we see the world around us. Our judgments about what is going on in the world and how to interpret events go a long way towards helping us define proper actions. Quite simply, how we view (or interpret) the world shapes how we act in the world.11

There is one place in life where fear shows itself in a big way—parents and their kids. The Pixar classic Finding Nemo highlights this brilliantly by showing us an example of paranoid parenting, and pointing us to the redemptive aspects of life, adventure, liminality, and communitas. Having lost his wife and a nestful of eggs in a shark attack, the clown fish Marlin makes it his mission in life to preserve his only remaining child, Nemo, from all danger. But Nemo is abducted, and Marlin goes after him. His newfound friend/comrade Dory willingly joins him on his quest to find his son and bring him home. At one point Marlin says to her: "I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him." To which Dory replies, "Huh. That's a funny thing to promise." "What?" "Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for Little Nemo."

We want our children to grow into adults who are expansive and generous rather than fearful and constricted.12 Bader-Saye also notes, When “good parenting” is replaced by “safe parenting,” child rearing is easily captured by consumption—we may not be able to buy goodness, but we can buy safety. And if a given product claims to make your child safer, how do you refrain from buying it without seeming to say, “I’m not interested in my child’s safety.” Yet where does it end?

Being locked in a padded room is very safe, but it’s hardly a life.13

Following the teachings of Jesus will involve us in risky practices like clothing the naked, visiting the prisoner, caring for the sick, welcoming the stranger, and feeding the hungry (see Matt. 25:31–46). Following the life of Jesus will mean walking in the way of the cross, the way of “self-giving love.” The apostle Paul describes this vocation in his second letter to the Corinthians, “For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh” (2 Cor. 4:11). Such risky discipleship can hardly be described as “safe.”... Faith must be daring, because following Jesus is risky.... Fear makes it difficult to embrace the vulnerability involved in discipleship.14 The Bible claims that the “fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (Ps. 111:10; Prov. 1:7; 2:5; Acts 9:31) and for good reason. It is probably the only fear that will not cripple us. Because “wisdom” is the ordering of life in accord with God’s will, appropriate fear of God is the only thing that gives us the right perspective of, and puts us into right relationship with, the objects of our perception. Holy reverence is therefore the right basis for coping with life’s meaning and problems. Here lies our much-needed perspective. From a biblical point of view, there is nothing neurotic about fearing God.

The neurotic thing is not to fear God, or to be afraid of the many other wrong things we tend to fear. “That is why God chooses to be known to us, so that we may stop being afraid of the wrong things.

When God is fully revealed to us and we ‘get it,’ then we experience the conversion of our fear.”15 “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind” (2 Tim. 1:7 NKJV). And so we discover that the fear of God, rather than being a repressive cringing from the intrusion of the Divine in our lives, turns out to be an unexpected gateway to the true love of God. This is the beginning of wisdom. And here is our much needed perspective.

## The Church’s Role

One of the roles of the church in all this must be to keep encouraging us all to live courageous lives in the gospel, to remain open-ended, and to call us to ongoing comradeship in God’s adventure. But the church doesn’t always accomplish this. Unless we are very careful to maintain authentic gospel perspectives in these matters, church can easily become the locus of our collective insecurities and its function downgraded to being the last line of moral defense in an immoral world.

Church plays a critical role in the liminal process of cultivating an adventurous faith to replace our fears. But, so often it is otherwise; Robert Capon wittily observes that the church, by and large, has had A Walk on the Wilder Side a poor record of encouraging freedom. She has spent so much time inculcating in us the fear of making mistakes that she has made us like ill-taught piano students: we play our songs, but we never hear them because our main concern is not to make music but to avoid some mistake that will get us into trouble.16 This is what we mean by “compound mentality,” where the church becomes the last refuge of fearful people who believe that the whole world is plotting our demise. But this is an abdication of what it really means to be the church that Jesus built! If the brave, loving life and sacrificial death of Jesus (and the apostolic church, and other great movements, for that matter) teach us anything, it is that his cause cannot be defeated by sin and evil—heck, he is the one who defeated sin in the first place! And his church ought to be the one place where this triumph is clearly on display for all to see (Eph.

2:14–22; Col. 2:13–15). “You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world” (1 John 4:4). And lest you think that the church is a defensive unit, just remember that it’s the gates of hell that don’t hold up against our advances... not the other way around (Matt. 16:18)!

By taking our eyes off the ball, or anxiously focusing on technique, on orderly worship, political correctness, or whatever, we not only lose focus, we also miss the point of what it is all about. Only Christians who refuse to be infected by the neurotic anxieties so prevalent in our age will have any hope of exercising missional impact on the surrounding culture. Such disciples will not scorn the anxieties of other people but will show them how to extricate themselves from fears and will point out the paths by which they can step out into the open—“into faith’s daring.”17

## A Vision Bigger Than Our Fears

But we all know that we can’t simply command ourselves to feel less fear, can we? What we can do is allow the fears themselves to be overwhelmed by bigger and better things—by a sense of adventure and the fullness of life that comes from relocating our fears and vulnerabilities within the larger story that is ultimately hopeful and not tragic.18 And we can thereby learn what it means to live, learn, and love in Jesus’s name.

There is no doubt that to walk with Jesus means to walk on the wilder side of life. Spirituality and discipleship in the Way of Jesus is demanding, but it is also God’s blueprint for an authentic life of wholesome (holy) humanity. But let’s face it, not many of us take this journey, or at least we do it only halfheartedly. Wherever we are required to reach down into our innermost recesses, into the heart of personality, we think it too risky, and so most of us are overcome by fear, and many run away. The life well lived, the adventure of discipleship, therefore remains a half-experience, relegated largely to the youthful years. English novelist Mary Cholmondeley says that “every day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which, shirking pain, misses happiness as well.”19 So how do we recapture in a deeply personal way that primal love that makes us whole, that passion that drives us onto the streets and into the neighborhoods, that life we sense is being lived to the full?

Part of the answer lies in overcoming our fears as described above. It also means learning to love, breaking the cloying cultural constraints that have hemmed us in, and overcoming our aversion to risk.

Of all these, love is the greatest (1 Cor. 13:13).

## Loving Love

Starting from the biblical revelation, saints as well as psychologists of all persuasions affirm that people need to love and learn how to love if they are to grow into mature human beings. In ReJesus and again in Untamed,20 we asserted that all Christian spirituality can be traced back to Jesus’s complete (re)affirmation of the shema— the unavoidable call to live a life of wholeness under the One True God, loving him with heart, soul, mind, strength, and loving one’s neighbors as oneself. According to our Lord, there are no higher obligations to God, no greater spirituality, than this duty to live a life of multidimensional love (Mark 12:29–31).

Learning to love, and therefore becoming mature, is no mean feat. It requires putting oneself on the line and embracing the risk, A Walk on the Wilder Side even likelihood, of pain and suffering. There is no way around this; St. Augustine is right when he notes in his confessions that every new love contains “the seeds of fresh sorrows.”21 Our most perceptive thinkers have known this all along, and actually, except for the more sociopathic personality, we ourselves know this only too well. We feel it every time we put our hearts on the line. C. S. Lewis perhaps best captures this tragic element in love with these unforgettable words of insight and warning:

> Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be
> broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give
> your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round
> safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—
> instead it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The

The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations [disturbances] of love is Hell.22 To love is to suffer... and that’s probably why we generally don’t do it well. Unwillingness to venture, plus a desire to be safe, holds us back from love. To be sure, most of us do have a vision of what makes for a good life, and as believers we know that it involves growing in the love of God. What we seem to lack, however, is the will to attain this good life of love. Most of us prefer to skip over the pain and the discipline, to find some easy, off-the-shelf ways to sainthood. Christian self-help spiritualities are a classic dodge of the real issues and manifestly do not produce maturity. We do well to be reminded of the cost of shortcuts in Carl Jung’s penetrating statement, “Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.”23 In his classic novel The Shoes of the Fisherman, Australian author Morris West writes: It costs so much to be a full human being that there are very few who have the enlightenment or the courage to pay the price. One has to abandon altogether the search for security and reach out to the risk of living with both arms outstretched. One has to embrace the world like a lover. One has to accept pain as a condition of existence. One has to court doubt at the cost of knowing. One needs a will stubborn in conflict but apt always to total acceptance of every consequence of living and dying.24 As extreme and destabilizing as Morris West’s statement appears at first, we all sense the truth in it. Love is risky stuff to be sure; it requires moral courage and willful commitment, and will take us on an adventure deep into God’s world far away from our narrow self-concerns. As C. S. Lewis notes, even the most lawless and inordinate loves are less contrary to God’s will than a self-invited and self-protective lovelessness.25 In the end it is better, and much more human, to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. Why?

Because “God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him” (1 John 4:16).

## Wild at Heart

This phrase, made famous by John Eldredge in his book by the name,26 became a catchcry for the journey that men must make in order to recover a full masculinity. Mark Twain wryly commented that “most men die at 27; we just bury them at 72.” Whatever the reasons, this idea does have amazing resonance. When Alan twittered this quote recently, there were over 300 retweets in one day, and it started a massive discussion in Facebook. People today do feel a death of something essential, an experience of being domesticated.

Whatever the cause, this cultural suppression of the spirit of adventure creates the conditions for either the repressed masculine anger that so readily erupts in male violence or the inverted feminine rage that can appear as self-hatred. While speaking of maleness, writers like Robert Bly, John Eldredge, and Richard Rohr affirm the need to recover the wildly holy, passionate, warrior-like aspect in order to grow into the image that God made them to be.27 But this is not only an issue of masculinity. All Christians, male and female, must recover what it means to be wild at heart—holy warriors.

We would commend such similar wild energy for women. And so, we believe, do many women. How else do we account for the immensely popular feminist book Women Who Run with the Wolves, written long before Eldredge’s Wild at Heart?28 Author Clarissa Estes maintains, A Walk on the Wilder Side Healthy wolves and healthy women share certain psychic characteristics: keen sensing, playful spirit, and a heightened capacity for devotion. [They] are relational by nature, inquiring, possessed of great endurance and strength... they are fiercely stalwart and very brave. Yet both have been hounded and harassed.... They have been the targets of those who would clean up the wilds.29 Part of this “cleaning up the wilds” comes from a culture designed to make us all passive units of consumption. “The Matrix” of middleclass suburbia, with its shopping malls, schools, and single-family houses complete with massive entertainment systems, is designed to keep us subservient and unquestioning. But it’s a largely invisible enemy, and it’s written through our internal cultural coding—our “software” so to speak. In this cultural script, the vision of the good life is reduced to being a highly brand-aware, conspicuous consumer, rather than being someone whose life should count for something, who makes a difference in the world. Maybe we all need to learn to run with the wolves again. Douglas Coupland spoke for a generation when he said,

> You see, when you’re middle class, you have to live with the fact that
> history will ignore you. You have to live with the fact history can
> never champion your causes and that history will never feel sorry for

And because of this price, all happinesses are sterile; all sadnesses go unpitied.30 Agreeing with this, Stephen Lyng, in his book Edgework, suggests that despite the propensity to anesthetize ourselves against danger with middle-class consumption, we can rarely remain satisfied in that place. Referring to risk-taking and adventurous behavior as “edgework,” he reminds us that all the attractions of modern middle-class suburban living don’t compare to true adventure (or edgework). He says, “New means of consumption create spectacular environments and experiences for people looking to escape the stultifying environments of daily work life. But few of these settings and consumption activities can match the transcendent experience of edgework.”31 If only the church could believe this and recognize that rather than sacralizing materialism and baptizing consumption, they should provide that “transcendent experience” of liminality and adventure, calling their members out of middle-class safety and into mission.

But the standard churchy spirituality does not require any real action, courage, or sacrifice from its attendees. Church attendance, tithing, Bible study, and worship are all genuinely good things but, separated as they are from the more active, liminal forms of spirituality, tend to add to the already stultifying passivity we already feel. True biblical spirituality must always strain against any drift to mere social conformity as if it were (God forbid) some form of inevitable fact we all eventually have to come to grips with. If that were the case, then Coupland’s tragic description applies equally to the average “church attendee.” The very phrase church attendee, while a fitting description of how so many understand the demands of Christianity, is an insult to the kind of lifestyle that Jesus wants from us.

The church of Jesus needs to wake up from the exile of passivity and embrace liminality and adventure or continue to remain a religious ghetto for culturally co-opted, fearful, middle-class folk.

Our very souls are at stake.

> The Educational Aspects of Adventure

Peter Drucker said that people who don’t take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year, and that people who do take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year. If he is right in this, then why would we not be people who take the risks? At least we will learn from failure in the process. If we never risk failure, we will never succeed—even in the smallest things. We do well to remember the parable of the talents in this regard; it ends with this warning: “For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him” (Matt. 25:14–29). Surely it’s better to spend whatever gifts we have been given by God in faithful risk-taking than fearfully hiding them away. If we fail, at least we will fail faithfully and not fearfully.

All this raises the role of liminality in learning and education. To return to Lyng’s seminal book on the sociology of risk, Edgework,32 the authors describe a certain kind of knowledge only available at the edge, or in our language, in the liminal space. It’s the kind of A Walk on the Wilder Side learning that can only occur in more extreme contexts and is pretty much captured in this quote from American novelist Louisa May Alcott: “I’m not afraid of storms, for I’m learning how to sail my ship.”33 The storm is an essential element in learning how to sail a ship. It is also perhaps the reason why, for instance, the Grand Prix competition is the primary seedbed for innovation in autoengineering. The liminal contexts of learning provoke new insights on old themes. This “edge” intelligence is sometimes difficult for edgeworkers to describe, largely because it is so experiential, but it yields conceptual insights that cannot be gained otherwise.

Kurt Hahn, the great educator, understood the importance of liminality for edgework when he pioneered what is called “expeditionary learning,” a form of education that has been used to develop people of all ages and in every continent. Expeditionary learning uses adventurous (liminal) experiences to create situations of learning, and so the principles are useful for us here.

1. The primacy of self-discovery: Learning happens best with

emotion, challenge, and the requisite support. People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. In the situations created by expeditionary learning, learners undertake tasks that require perseverance, fitness, craftsmanship, imagination, self-discipline, and significant achievement. Ateacher’s primary task in such situations is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more than they think they can.

2. Generating and testing viable ideas: In situations of liminality

and risk, innovation inevitably occurs. Here the role of teaching is to foster curiosity about the world by creating learning situations that provide something important to think about, time to experiment, and time to make sense of what is observed.

3. The personal and social responsibility for learning: In liminal

situations we discover that learning is both a personal process of discovery and a social activity. Everyone learns both individually and as part of a group. Every aspect of the learning process encourages both participants to become increasingly responsible for directing their own personal and collective learning.

4. Empathy and caring: Liminality creates the conditions where

people learn to have each other’s backs. Learning is fostered best in communities where learners’ as well as teachers’ ideas are respected and where there is mutual trust. Expeditionary learning promotes the extensive use of small groups and personal mentors while in the situation of adventure.

5. Learning from success and failure: Because the situation places

the learners at risk, they learn vital lessons from failure as well as success. All students need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges. But it is also important for students to learn from their failures, to persevere when things are hard, and to learn to turn disabilities into opportunities.

6. Collaboration and competition: In expeditionary learning,

individual and group development are integrated so that the value of friendship, trust, and group action is clear. Learners are encouraged to compete not against each other but with their own personal best and with rigorous standards of excellence.

7. Diversity and inclusion: Both diversity and inclusion increase

the richness of ideas, creative power, problem-solving ability, and respect for others. In expeditionary learning, learners investigate and value their different histories and talents as well as those of other communities and cultures. Learning groups are therefore heterogeneous.

8. Learning from Creation: Adirect and respectful relationship

with the natural world refreshes the human spirit and teaches the important ideas of recurring cycles and organic rhythms.

Because they are in touch with real conditions of life and nature, learners become stewards of the earth and of future generations.

9. Solitude and reflection: Students and teachers need time alone

explore their own thoughts, make their own connections, and create their own ideas. They also need time to compare notes and share their reflections with others. The relative lulls in the adventure experience create perfect conditions for such reflective learning.

10. Service and compassion: All, teachers and students alike, are

crew and no one is allowed to be a passenger—all are participants. Everyone is strengthened by acts of significant service to A Walk on the Wilder Side others, and one of expeditionary learning’s primary functions is to instill in learners the attitudes and skills to learn from and be of service to others.34

1. Foster Pioneering and Protest

Genuine learning and advancement in the church, as in all aspects of life, will generally be led by a few people who are willing to break from the herd instincts of the crowd. If we are going to be innovative in mission, we will need to foster a pioneering spirit because, as we have seen, more of the same is not going to get the job done.

Pioneers have to be a particularly hardy bunch. New social and religious movements inevitably arise as a protest against the status quo, which in turn arouses sometimes stern opposition from the system from which they emerge (e. g., the Celts and the Roman Catholics, Francis and the popes, Wesley and Booth and the Anglicans, Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, etc.). Machiavelli was not far wrong when he said, “Nothing is more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than achieving a new order of things.”35 Would-be innovator-reformers will have adversaries who directly benefit from the old order and halfhearted defenders (lukewarm largely because of fear of the adversaries) who would benefit from the new. It’s the reason why prophets and apostles are almost always persecuted and tend to stand alone.

At all turning points in history, when the older forms are dying, new possibilities are created by a few people who are not afraid to stand out and risk security. Susan B. Anthony, the remarkable civil rights activist and pioneer of the women’s suffrage movement in the United States, knew this all too well. Speaking from experience, she said, Cautious, careful people always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world’s estimation, and publicly and privately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and persecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences.36

2. Stir Up Holy Discontent

Karl Marx said that, in order to foster revolution, activists will need to “rub raw the sores of discontent.” He understood that people would not pay the price for change unless they feel a profound sense of disgruntlement with the prevailing conditions. Now we think this is a highly manipulative thing to do in the context of a political revolution, but this should not obscure the redeemable truth that lies behind this approach—discontent results in movement and movement in change. Or, in the interests of a holy revolution, we have got to cultivate a holy discontent in our own hearts and in our systems if we are going to move toward a better future. Speaking of our spiritual yearnings, Jewish theologian/philosopher Abraham Heschel says, “All that is creative stems from the seed of endless discontent....

He who is satisfied has never truly craved.”37 In order to engender change in our lives, especially in organizations, we have to sell the problem before we sell the solution.

But holy discontent need not always be the result of a prophetic critique of things; it could come about from a holy sense of curiosity and being attentive to the provocatively fertile nature of good, probing, questions. As discussed in the Introduction, we ought never to take ourselves out of the questing aspect of Christianity and discipleship. Spiritual quests in particular are driven by the need for a deeper, more satisfying experience of life and faith.

Questing is the result of holy discontent, and more often than not, as in all genuine renewal movements, they are the result of the Holy Spirit working directly in our lives. And behind every A Walk on the Wilder Side good quest lies at least one really good question—we do well to heed Einstein’s advice to a young admirer when he said, “The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.”38

3. Trade Your Traditionalism for Traditio n

While it is true to say what got you here won’t get you there, genuine learning is not done in a historical vacuum, and innovation is not simply novelty. Some of our best expressions of adventurous church have been movements that exist in our past and form part of our historical tradition. In The Forgotten Ways Alan suggested that every church already has all it needs to get the job done—in other words, we have latent potentials, and through disuse or misuse, we have simply forgotten how to activate them. Part of our learning then is not simply coming up with faddish ideas, but recovering the deepest identity and potentials that we already have as God’s people. Becoming the church that Jesus built will require courage, because it means letting go of what we have become... of abandoning the security of institutional church to become a movement.

At the conclusion of the musical Fiddler on the Roof, the question is asked, “What holds him [the Fiddler] up?” The answer the audience hears is “Tradition.” But being guided by tradition and being traditionalist are two entirely different things. The traditionalist is the institutional persecutor of change and will subvert the missional cause. I ntransigent and closed to the spirit, they lazily rely on the past successes of those who have paved the way before them. Tradition, on the other hand, involves being sensitive to the fact that we have a long history and we don’t operate in a vacuum. Paradosis, the Greek word for tradition, means “to hand down.” The creativity of “fiddling around” is possible when it is done within the ongoing self-consciousness of being part of the ancient people of God. What we do now has a past as much as it has a future. It is this sense of identity handed down through time that gives us the imagery and the security to think the new. Undoubtedly the best way to preserve tradition is to have children, not wear your father’s old hat (attributed to Picasso).

4. Be Willing to Fail Forward

Trial and error is one of the most basic ways of learning. So much so that Albert Einstein, arguably the greatest scientist ever, once said, Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

Besides the practical knowledge that defeat offers, there are important personality benefits gained in the process. Defeat strips away false values and makes you realize what you really want.39 It means that when something fails, we have to let go of ideas we have become attached to or that have somehow attached themselves to us.

One of the greatest qualities in adventurous learners is that they have learned to fail forward. In his book Failing Forward, John Maxwell writes that there are seven key abilities that allow successful people to fail forward instead of taking each setback personally.40 According to him, “successful” people:

Reject rejection: Successful people don’t blame themselves when they fail. They take responsibility for each setback, but they don’t take the failure personally.

View failure as temporary: “People who personalize failure see a problem as a hole they’re permanently stuck in,” writes Maxwell. “But achievers see any predicament as temporary.” View each failure as an isolated incident: Successful people don’t define themselves by individual failures. They recognize that each setback is a small part of the whole.

Have realistic expectations: Too many people start big projects with the unrealistic expectation that they’ll see immediate results. Success takes time. When you pursue anything worthwhile, there are going to be bumps along the way. And remember: the perfect is the enemy of the good.

Focus on strengths: If you operate from your weaknesses you are going to fail time and again. To be sure, you must not allow weaknesses to undermine you, but work from the basis of your strengths.

Vary approaches: Adventurers are willing to vary their approaches to problems. If one approach doesn’t work for you, if it brings A Walk on the Wilder Side repeated failure, then try something else. To fail forward, you must do what works for you, not necessarily what works for other people.

Bounce back: Finally, successful people are resilient. They don’t let one error keep them down. They learn from their mistakes and move on. To paraphrase Edward de Bono, it is better to have enough ideas for some of them to be wrong, than to be always right by having no ideas at all.41

## Stakeholdin g

One other principle of liminality should be factored into our equation. We call it the stakeholder principle. It is the idea that all the players in a project ought to have a direct stake in the outcomes, because if strategic choices don’t fundamentally impact us personally, it is unlikely we will make decisions with the kind of seriousness they deserve. We need to act as if our lives depended on it.

When all our church ever expects from us is attendance and tithing, we hardly feel as though our lives are at stake. Indeed, in medium to large-sized churches, many people suspect their attendance and tithing wouldn’t really be missed. In those churches where the Sunday meeting is the primary project, most members know the show will go on with or without them. This can hardly be called stakeholding, and once members work that out, they find all sorts of excuses for only attending every other week, or every three weeks, or less. In this respect, as we identified in our first book together, The Shaping of Things to Come, most churches are mainly audiences, and any member of an audience is dispensable. As soon as you know you’re dispensable, the impetus for attendance is lost. After all, the play will still be performed even if half the theatre seats are unoccupied. However, the play cannot be performed if any of the cast is absent—or if performed, it is diminished in some way by the absence of that cast member. Actors in a repertory company are stakeholders in that company.

Liminal churches are more like repertory theatre companies than their audiences, and as a result they know the powerful sense of connection with each other—that camaraderie—that won’t allow any member to let the others down. For the rep company, the common ordeal they face is opening night. For a liminal church, there needs to be a similarly common ordeal, and everyone needs to be committed to owning that challenge collectively. Without significant levels of buy-in or stakeholding by the team, the possibility of significant levels of innovation and energy are reduced. This is only exacerbated when considering the role of the leaders.

Alan learned this very painfully in one of his missional adventures when he opened Elevation, a café and nightclub in Melbourne, as a missional proximity space in 2001.42 Arisky venture (it was an innovative start-up in a highly competitive field), it eventually failed, costing a lot of money and having a damaging impact on the church that was involved. On reflection, one of the biggest mistakes made was in hiring a manager rather than engaging a stakeholding partner in that role. The manager, a hireling, was empowered to make serious decisions on a daily basis, but had no real stake in the business—or as Americans say, he had “no skin in the game.” He was basically in a “job.” If it failed, then no worries, he could easily seek another one. And that’s exactly what happened. It got tough and he left at a critical time, leaving the partners in one big mess. Alan swore never to make the same mistake again. The learning: in all major projects people who make decisions about the future of the venture should somehow hold stakes in the outcomes. If all goes well, they win; if it does not go well, they lose some skin along with the other stakeholders.

Burn the Boats!

In 1519, with some 600 men, 16 or so horses, and 11 boats, Hernán Cortés landed on a vast inland plateau now called Mexico. They had come from Spain to the New World in search of some of the world’s greatest treasure. But, with only 600 men with no protective armor, conquering an empire so extensive was a highly unlikely affair.

Instead of charging through cities and forcing his men into immediate battle, Cortés stayed on the beach and awoke the souls of his men with emblazoned speeches ingeniously designed to urge on the spirit of adventure and invoke a thirst for lifetimes of fortune amongst A Walk on the Wilder Side his troops. His orations bore fruit, for what was supposedly a military exploit now took on an extravagant romance in the imaginations of the troops. I ronically, it was not the eloquent “preaching” that led to the ultimate victory of those adventurers; it was just three words that would change the history of the New World. As they marched inland to face their enemies, Cortés ordered, “Burn the boats!” They did, and thereby eradicated any possibility of retreat from the minds of the troops. They had to commit themselves unwaveringly to the cause—win or die. Retreat was no longer an option.

Putting aside the violent nature of the example above (the conquistadors were cruel and rapacious colonizers), we can observe the power of the no turning back approach to innovation in the story of Cortés and his conquistadors. Troy Tyler, a very successful entrepreneur, says it this way: “Strategy is all about commitment. If what you’re doing isn’t irrevocable, then you don’t have a strategy—because anyone can do it.... I’ve always wanted to treat life like I was an invading army and there was no turning back.”43 When there is no possibility of retreat, we will find the innovation that only the liminal situation can bring. In short, we find the faith of leap. Or, as the novelist Katherine Mansfield put it, “Whenever I prepare for a journey I prepare as though for death. Should I never return, all is in order.”44 The Hero’s Journey Becoming Who We Were Made to Be It is only in adventure that some people succeed in knowing themselves.
