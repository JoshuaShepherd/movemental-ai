# Chapter 7: The Risk of Neighborliness: An Invitation to Take the Plunge

> We need to come to terms with the fact that when groups embrace the adventure and risk of mission, they will be drawn more and more deeply into the village to which God sends them. We must be

The fact is that if Jesus’s future kingdom is secure, those who trust in its coming will enact it now. With hope as our guide, we are called to fashion traces of the coming kingdom right here, and one of the primary ways to do that is by the practice of good neighborliness.

Those with no confidence in the unfolding of Jesus’s kingdom might think the present ought to be shaped by greed, injustice, exploitation, brutality, and barbarism. But the hopeful ones know that we embrace the future now by becoming better neighbors.

When asked which was the most important commandment, Jesus said, “Love God and love your neighbor.” Have you ever noted that, though he is asked for the most important commandment, he gives them two? It’s as if he’s saying, “You cannot have one without the other. With God you always get the neighbor as well.” We might live in a society that wants to separate God from neighborliness, but you can’t claim to love God without loving the neighbor. In Jesus’s vision of the world, they are a package deal. So, in a kingdom of neighborliness, the homeless, the widow, the orphan, the illegal immigrant, the poor, the disabled all count. They become agents of hope, opportunities for us to express our confidence in the coming kingdom, rather than threats or inconveniences.

This ought to be as true in Austin as it is in Andong. When Christian community is shaped by the risk of mission, the context for that mission takes on greater significance than in traditional, programcentered churches. Rather than developing a set of prefabricated church programs and rolling them out across the world regardless of the culture in which they are placed, missional communities take context much more seriously. Context is not only the zone in which the adventure of mission occurs, it is a distinct contributor to the shape that mission takes, because that mission is at the very least about Christian neighborliness. It provides both the social and environmental contours that form the peculiar nature of any missional community that grows there. When a missional community is prepared to embrace the risk and adventure of mission, it must be equally as prepared to embrace the risk of taking its context seriously and allowing it to, in some meaningful fashion, shape the future of the church itself.

Yet the cookie-cutter approach of the evangelical church growth movement has led to the current penchant for church franchising—the duplication of a one-size-fits-all model replete with consistency in musical style, meeting ambience, preaching, and doctrine. Everything is prefabricated; the whole venture is engineered in some head office; the approach is dictated by experts, based on their presuppositions.

Nothing is indigenous, nothing feels homegrown. Nothing feels, well... neighborly.

## Suburban Homelessness

Perhaps much of the current rootlessness of the franchise church is due to the increasing sense of homelessness experienced by its leaders, particularly those in the United States. Many American pastors, like many American professionals in general, didn’t grow up where they currently work. It is nothing to meet a church leader who grew up in a small town in Texas, went to college in Michigan, seminary in California, and pastored or planted churches in North Carolina, Minnesota, and Virginia.

## Teflon-Coated Christians

This extraordinary capacity to migrate right across a continent, apparently at home anywhere and everywhere, might at first look like just the kind of flexibility needed for missionary activity. This has been expressed to us by some leaders with the charming selfappellation: “I’m just a bloom-where-I’m-planted kind of guy.” This might sound good in theory, but we think it can lead to the kind of spiritual Teflon coating that means they never actually stick anywhere. As long ago as the early 1970s, sociologist Peter Berger was pointing this out:

Modern man has suffered from a deepening condition of “homelessness.” The result of the migratory character of his experience of society and of self has been called a metaphysical loss of home.1 The Risk of Neighborliness Admittedly, much of the United States was evangelized by itinerant preachers, so the itinerant lifestyle holds a certain mythic romance to many American Christians. We don’t rule out that in following the missio Dei, many are called to move geographically. But we also want to sound a warning that the current obsession with migrating from one city or state to another every four or five years only reinforces to the congregations they serve that the church doesn’t really “belong” in the soil in which it has been planted. If the minister could be uprooted at any time and replanted somewhere else, so could the ministry. Other countries in the West might not have the same dramatic migration pattern as the United States, but they still see their ministers moving on every four or five years, and as a result the church in the West is suffering from a sense of suburban homelessness, never at home in its local neighborhood.

Writing over twenty years ago, author and poet Wendell Berry was decrying the arrogance of property developers and industrialists who never live in the neighborhoods they create and who make decisions about the destruction of ecosystems they have never seen.

Referring to these industrialist mercenaries, he says: The members of this prestigious class of rampaging professionals are the purest sort of careerists—upwardly mobile transients who will permit no stay or place to interrupt their personal advance. They must have no local allegiances; they must not have a local point of view.

In order to be able to desecrate, endanger, or destroy a place, after all, one must be able to leave it and forget it. One must never think of one’s place as one’s home; one must never think of any place as anyone else’s home.2 When churches are led by people who don’t belong, who aren’t really at home in the neighborhood, they generate and fund ministries that bear no relationship to the sense of place or to the potential future of that neighborhood. As Berry says of developers, the same can be said of these ministers who have no local allegiances, no indigenous points of view. In fact, it is not uncommon to find a church in conflict with its neighbors over parking issues or development applications.

Amissional church sees itself as a sent community, and where incarnational mission is the organizing function, social context becomes an extremely important matter. In effect, a missional church identifies itself to some considerable measure as God’s gift to a town or village or neighborhood. Therefore, missional churches must take seriously the rhythms of local life, the environmental and social realities of the community, and allow them to affect the kind of church that emerges there. This is another expression of communitas, the binding together of differing gifts and perspectives in the collective exercise of embedding into a culture, something way beyond the expertise or talent of any individual. Neighborliness is a corporate activity.

## Staying Home

Akey issue for any group willing to embrace the risk and adventure of mission is to dare to believe that they have been sent to stay home. That is, that home might be the very best place for them to serve and that the missionary call to “Go” might still apply, but it is a going deeper, not a going away. It is being sent in to every arena, domain, and context of life, not simply geographical moves. Sentness is an identity thing, not simply a geographic one.

We are anxious that our calls to adventure are not seen as implying an adrenaline-fueled, death-defying, nonstop, helter-skelter experience of life. It is truly an adventurous thing to embrace the risky call to societal engagement in our own neighborhood and to reach out, and to know and be known by the people with whom we share our roads, schools, malls, and cafés. Even those groups who have sensed God’s call on their collective lives to incarnate themselves into a new neighborhood must see that that call is never completed until they have made that neighborhood truly their home. To return to Wendell Berry, he advises us quite simply,

> Make a home. Help to make a community. Be loyal to what you have
> made. Put the interests of your community first. Love your neigh-
> bors—not the neighbors you pick out but the ones you have.3
> est craze for “video-venue churches” where people gather to watch
> preachers beamed in via satellite from the “mother church” across
> borhood doesn’t deserve good neighbors, only good technology. This
> with locals wondering about our motives, and assuming the church
> the growth of the denomination from which it comes.

We guess even the church members feel this sense of disconnection as well. For instance, listening to the satellite-preacher might work most of the time—well, at least until a beloved member dies or a localized catastrophe occurs, and when that Sunday’s sermon makes no reference to it, we are reminded that our external preacher doesn’t actually belong to our community, and we feel ripped off, spiritually and emotionally.

Finding a home and staying there is an essential skill for missional churches. It invites us to learn a dialect, discover a rhythm, and hitch our collective future to that of the village. Even those who relocate across town or around the world need to embrace the belief that they are now at home where God has placed them. They might be an “introduced species,” but they are to see their function as adding value or bringing benefit to their new place.

In our homeland of Australia, cattle ranchers have introduced a type of egret as a biocontrol, for the purpose of picking ticks and flies from the skin of their cattle. You might have seen a similar bird perched on the backs of elephants and rhinoceroses in the wilds of Africa. They are doing more than hitching a ride; they eat the parasites that infect the skin of large mammals. They are an introduced species, but their contribution to the original inhabitants is beneficial. Ecologists call this mutualism. However, while the egret is a good example of this mutually beneficial Introduction, its cousin (and look-alike) the oxpecker is not so. Originally thought to be an example of mutualism, oxpeckers are more likely themselves parasites. Oxpeckers do eat ticks, but often it’s the ticks that have already fed on the host mammal, and there has been no proven statistically significant link between oxpecker presence and a reduction in parasite activity. In fact, it is now known that oxpeckers prefer to gouge at their host mammal’s skin while searching for parasites so they too can drink the blood of their host. Our point for all this bird-talk: missional churches must link with neighbors and be seen, like the egret, as bringing a beneficial contribution to the neighborhood.

Similarly, missional churches must consider their context like an ecosystem, an environment of interdependence and mutualism, and contribute accordingly. In her book on bioregionalism, Judith Plant says,

Home! Remembering and reclaiming the ways of our species where people and place are delicately interwoven in a web of life—human community finding its particular place within the living and dying that marks the interdependence of life in an integrated ecosystem.4 The question for missional Christians is how they might be properly knitted into that interdependency of life in the integrated ecosystem of a town, village, or neighborhood. And here is where the risk comes in. Embracing our calling to integrate within the ecosystem of “home” requires what biblical scholar Walter Brueggemann refers to as an “endlessly cunning, risky process of negotiation with our world.”5 In our travels speaking about the missional church, we are constantly asked about this aspect of missiology. How do we belong to a place without having our beliefs compromised by that community? For many church leaders, contact with place is tantamount to contamination by that place. Their presence in any particular environment is seen as an endorsement of everything that goes on in that place. We say this shouldn’t be seen as such. Jesus managed to eat at the tables of sinners without endorsing all their behavior.

Indeed, his presence at Zaccheaus’s table evoked a dramatic display of repentance by the host. Nonetheless, we do acknowledge that missional believers must be prepared to enter into a process of ongoing negotiation with their host culture. But that seems too obvious. How do we contextualize the church in a disinterested, even hostile, culture without giving away too much at the negotiating table?

## Risky Negotiation

In 1987, missiologist Paul Hiebert proposed his now well-known framework for the critical contextualization of the gospel in The Risk of Neighborliness un-Christian contexts. His model has been embraced around the world by those involved in cross-cultural mission. It is a risky prospect, and the source of the risk is in the possibility of syncretizing the gospel, although Hiebert’s model attempts to build safeguards that minimize the risk and limit that possibility. It doesn’t rule them out, but it takes their possibility more seriously. The innovative aspect of Hiebert’s approach is that it is based on the fundamental assumption that contextualization is a corporate venture. In other words, even the process of contextualizing the church and its message is an opportunity for communitas! The four stages are as follows:

1. Exegesis of the Culture

Hiebert proposed a thoroughgoing study of the culture into which the church is to be planted. It was his contention that the neighborhood and its culture must be examined phenomenologically by the whole church, including the newest members. It might well be that the leaders of the faith community lead the process, but such an exegesis of culture should be a communal activity. In a cross-cultural setting this means that the locals and the missionary would gather as much data about the host culture as possible, recognizing that for the missionary this will often include very new information. For missional churches in the West, it means a regular examination of our own culture, struggling against overfamiliarity and complacency.

Missionaries in a new country will automatically have a wide-eyed curiosity about their new home. In the West we need to foster a similarly wide-eyed approach to exegeting our own culture.

It never ceases to amaze us how many church leaders have such little awareness of the cultural rhythms of their context. Presuming it to be just like the last town they lived in, they plough forward with little appreciation of the subtle distinctions and differences that make up the uniqueness of each and every place. When Michael first visited Houston, he asked his host, a local minister, whether they might visit the world-famous Rothko Chapel, built by John and Dominique de Menil in 1971. The de Menils founded the chapel as an intimate sanctuary for people of every belief and filled it with the mural canvasses of American abstract expressionist Mark Rothko.

The chapel welcomes thousands of visitors each year, people of every faith and from all parts of the world. Indeed, the chapel has become a rallying place for all people concerned with peace, freedom, and social justice throughout the world. But Michael’s host had never heard of it, even though it was just down the road from his church.

Here was a marker, a secular indicator of spiritual yearning and religious harmony, but the church was oblivious to it.

As Hiebert says, we need to become curious about our own world.

We need to get out of our cars and walk the streets of our neighborhood. We need to embrace our function as missionary/anthropologists and be prepared to dig into the soil in which our church has been planted. As Mc Cartney, quoted by Marcus Curnow, says, The important thing for me now is to understand my place, the place in which I was born and the place in which I live. I’m slowly learning more about the natural habitat, the original inhabitants of the place and understanding that without that connection to my environment and the spiritual base of my place, I will never be able to play a useful part in the transformation of our white-centered, predominantly spiritual-less society that we call home.6 But as we mentioned earlier, Hiebert’s genius in this respect is to insist that such an understanding be developed corporately. This is not simply the work of the clergy but of the whole faith community, who “uncritically gather and analyze the traditional beliefs and customs associated with some question at hand.”7 Note the twofold emphasis on both congregational involvement and situation-specific questions. In Hiebert’s understanding, the missionary is not the only expert; the whole Christian community becomes involved. Also, rather than a wide-ranging investigation of a particular cultural milieu (which would require the skills of an anthropologist), the locals are asked to center their inquiries on important issues raised in the day-to-day living out of faith. Acongregation ought to be taken through a serious and thorough examination of certain aspects of their culture, its language, the longings of its people, its pathways of communication, etc. Heibert emphasizes that this ought to be done uncritically. The congregation shouldn’t jump to any conclusions or judgments. This step of the process involves simply listening and collating information, a difficult The Risk of Neighborliness process for many Christians since the suspension of judgment is a rare thing in church circles.

There are real traces of this approach found in the church-growth models of American Christian leaders like Rick Warren (Saddleback Community Church) and Bill Hybels (Willow Creek Community Church). However, Hiebert is proposing something more systematic than simply asking nonchurchgoers to identify what they want in a church. He is proposing an ongoing analysis of the context in which a church exists. Therefore, a missional church will be ever involved in the gathering and analyzing of traditional beliefs and customs in their context. So rather than asking what people want in a church program and then giving it to them, the contextualizing church is always analyzing cultural shifts and trends, seeking to determine what in culture can be embraced and what must be resisted.

Hiebert encourages congregations to especially include new Christians in this process, by asking them about their beliefs and views.

Again, he insists that we be prepared to suspend judgment at this point. He says, The purpose here is to understand the old ways, not to judge them.

If at this point the missionary shows any criticism of the customary beliefs and practices, the people will not talk about them for fear of being condemned. We shall only drive the old ways underground.8 We are reminded here of the acerbic Australian journalist Max Harris, who once said, “Christians are a dim, ego-tripping minority which is dead set on telling everybody why they ought to become Christians, instead of finding out why they’re not.” Listening is justifiably part of any missional venture. In a culture where the church has been active for hundreds of years, it will serve that church well to seriously examine its own customs, language, traditions, and beliefs. Part of the church leader’s role will include the questioning of long-held sacred cows, not just for the sake of iconoclasm, but with a view to intentionally contextualizing the church.

2. Exegesis of the Scripture and the Hermeneutical Bridge

In the second step, Hiebert recommends that the missionary lead the congregation in a study of the Bible related to the question at hand. When we say “second step,” we don’t take Hiebert to mean that the study of the Scriptures can’t/shouldn’t take place until a certain level of sociological research has taken place in the previous step. They are not mutually exclusive concerns. The study of the Bible and the study of culture can happen simultaneously and, as we noted earlier, as part of an ongoing process of missional engagement. That being said, Hiebert sees the missionary as having a more key role in this second aspect than in the first.

This step is crucial, for if the people do not clearly grasp the biblical message as originally intended, they will have a distorted view of the gospel. This is where the pastor or missionary... has the most to offer in an understanding of biblical truth and in making it known in other cultures. While the people must be involved in the study of Scripture so that they grow in their own abilities to discern truth, the leader must have the meta-cultural grids that enable him or her to move between cultures.9

> So the role of the leader includes the teaching of biblical truth to a
> local congregation. This involves the process of reminding Christians
> not only of what the Bible says about soteriology and Christology, but
> class suburban morality is in fact ordained by Scripture and that most
> examination of New Testament ecclesiology would free congregations
> beliefs, and practices. In the same way that Peter had to reexamine his
> first-century church, so does the church today have to take a good look

3. Critical Response

Hiebert’s next stage sounds easy but is in fact very demanding.

After emphasizing the importance of the expertise of the missionary in the second stage, he now turns the process back to the people.

The third step is for the people corporately to evaluate critically their own past customs in the light of their new biblical understandings, The Risk of Neighborliness and to make decisions regarding their response to their new-found truths.10 This is an important feature of his model; it is congregationally based. It is not reliant on outside experts. It validates the contribution of both new converts and older committed Christians. He says, [The gospel] is a message to which people must respond.... It is not enough that the leaders be convinced about changes that may be needed. Leaders may share their personal convictions and point out the consequences of various decisions, but they must allow the people to make the final decision in evaluating their past customs.11

Hiebert makes the assumption that the newer members understand their culture better than those who have been Christians for longer.

If the Bible has been taught effectively and the culture examined creatively, then the Christian community must be trusted to evaluate the changes in language, customs, practices, and beliefs that need to be embraced in order to critically contextualize the gospel. It’s a risk. And it involves communitas. This is where Hiebert is at his most radical. He wants the leaders to trust the congregation, believing that if the process is guided effectively, wisdom and grace will emerge. After detailed and ongoing analysis of both Scripture and culture, the church ought to be free to abandon that which is not biblical, embrace that which is, and be creatively ambivalent about that which is neither affirmed nor condemned in Scripture.

4. New Contextualized Practices

After this process, the missional church under the direction of adaptive leaders will seek to arrange the practices they have chosen, modified, and created into a new set of rituals that contextually express Christian meaning in the very context from which it emerges.

But as we warned earlier, this process is a risky one because we run into the ever-real possibility of compromising the gospel in our attempts to be contextually appropriate. We readily acknowledge this, but we also think it important to note that very often what is appropriate missionally in one context might not be in another. This is part of the church’s great trauma of letting go of the one-size-fits-all approach. What seems biblically justified and culturally creative in a slum in Kenya might not be so in a suburb in London. We need to allow local churches to do the work outlined above and trust them to do so responsibly. This isn’t to say we can never be critical of what seems syncretistic from a distance, but we need to be prepared to sit within the context of a particular church before deeming it so.

For example, James,12 a Baptist missionary, works in a predominantly Buddhist country in Southeast Asia. Recently a Buddhist monk from one of the nearby monasteries approached him nervously to say he had had a very vivid dream in which Jesus appeared, radiating a very loving and comforting presence. The dream ended however with Jesus telling him he had something very important to say to him. At that point he awoke! Seeking James out, the monk naively asked the missionary what Jesus might have wanted to say to him.

Over several conversations, James shared the message of Jesus and eventually led the young monk in a prayer of commitment to Jesus as Lord and Savior. This young man has subsequently led a number of other Buddhist monks to faith in Jesus. So far, none of them have left their monastery. They continue to wear saffron robes, and when their fellow monks are meditating in the temple, they pray to their Lord and Master, Jesus. If the abbot insists on the performance of any activity considered unsavory to Christians, these young Christian men ask to be given the task of cleaning the monastery instead. Each week they meet with James to study the Bible and reflect on their culture in general and the culture of the monastic life in particular.

They are a missional communitas, a band of brothers thrown together by faith in Jesus and working together to understand how to take both Scripture and their context seriously.

And yet, many people have been very critical of James’s approach toward these new Christians. They believe he should insist that they renounce their Buddhist vows—vows of chastity, poverty, and selflessness—and leave the monastery. But James has found a home in this Southeast Asian land and understands the context. He has learned that many Asian monks are not devout Buddhists. They enter the monastery to receive a free education and to discipline their lives before embarking upon a secular career. Indeed, many leave the monastery when their term ends and attend university, looking for employment in multinational corporations. They are Buddhist by The Risk of Neighborliness culture, not by religious conviction. These new Christian “monks,” who take Jesus and faith with utmost seriousness, have far greater missional impact within the monastery than outside it.

The fear of syncretism is very real for all missional Christians, but we are heartened by Hiebert’s approach in that it takes the Bible seriously and recognizes the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of all believers. Like his contemporary Lesslie Newbigin, Paul Hiebert sees the church as a hermeneutical community, and as such the whole church must remain vigilant, actively pursuing God’s will for the shape of their community. Compare this to many churches that merely comprise inactive members who attend sporadically and rely on their paid experts to do the missional work for them. Like baby birds, they attend each Sunday, their beaks wide open, awaiting a predigested meal of secondhand belief and practice. In missional churches, the baby birds have been pushed out of the nest and are learning to fly for themselves.

Missionary, Grow Home!

And yet, it should be underscored that the process of contextualization is not a short-term project. David Bosch says that one should never suggest that the church has been “enculturated,” but rather that it remains in a constant state of “inculturation,” a tentative and continuing process. He points out that Christendom once saw itself as the former; that is, as a singular, fully indigenized, culturally superior, completed product.13 Today, we must come to terms with the reality that henceforth there will be a plurality of local, contextualized approaches, not any single monolithic one. Bosch called this “inter-culturation,” and it is the way of the future, even as it was at our very beginning.

Urban missionary Marcus Curnow has coined an interesting turn of phrase to describe this: “The historical cry of colonized communities whose social and physical ‘places’ have been destroyed by a Christianity complicit with imperialism is ‘Missionary go home!’”14 Recognizing this, Curnow cleverly suggests the church should embrace a new mantra: missionary, grow home! In so doing, he says, we must come to terms with the “empowering and creative process of literally ‘growing home.’”15 We take him to mean that the church must see itself as God’s gift to the local community and put down deep roots.

Abiblical example of this connection between the church and its physical environment can be seen in Revelation 3, where John writes one of his seven letters to the Christians in Laodicea. Admittedly, it is a negative example. He begins his letter with the well-known words, I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. (Rev. 3:15–16) Many preachers have claimed that the Laodiceans were being rebuked for their lack of zeal, hence the reference to being lukewarm.

However, the deeper truth is that John’s message to them is an allusion to the city’s unique water supply. Archaeologists have revealed that Laodicea had an aqueduct that carried water from hot mineral springs some five miles south. By the time the hot water had flowed that distance it had become tepid and, while drinkable, was hardly refreshing. By referencing the imagery of the aqueduct in his letter, John is saying something about the usefulness of the Laodiceans, not about their levels of enthusiasm. Whereas the hot springs at nearby Hierapolis and the pure water of Colossae are useful in their own ways, the lukewarm water at Laodicea was a symbol of the uselessness of the church there.

In a more positive sense, churches today can draw upon the natural landscape to remind themselves of their peculiar callings. Michael belongs to a missional church located on a narrow peninsula separating Sydney’s North Harbor from the Pacific Ocean. Environmental concerns, particularly coastal care, are of great importance to them.

They have called themselves, rather whimsically, “Small Boat, Big Sea.” It says something about the physical place where God has put them, and it says something about their spiritual place on the earth, as a small community in the big sea of six billion people across the world.

If the missionary is to truly “grow home,” he or she will need to reconnect with creation, protect the environment, and draw upon its symbols and seasons in the life of the church. And in a day and The Risk of Neighborliness age where environmental degradation is such an enormous global issue and many Christians are paralyzed, not knowing what they can do to have any positive impact, the rediscovery of local context, local responsibility, and local solutions is an empowering approach.

Ethicist Gordon Preece has coined the slogan “Parish or Perish” to remind churches that they are ultimately responsible for the place to which God has called them.16 When you visit many churches, their parking lots are crammed with the gas-guzzling SUVs of their members who have had to drive great distances to be there. If we saw our locality as being genuinely important to our missional calling, we would “church” in our own neighborhood, or relocate to the neighborhood where God wants us to serve.

We don’t think this rules out translocal mission work, as adventures often involve a road of some sort, but it does give us greater perspective of what it means to participate in incarnational adventure of mission. But they probably ought to be the exception, and not the rule. As we’ve already noted, Paul’s calling was a translocal one, preaching to those Gentiles who had never heard the gospel before, as he informs the Roman church:

> So from Jerusalem all the way around to I llyricum, I have fully pro-
> claimed the gospel of Christ. It has always been my ambition to
> preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not
> “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have
> Again, note his extraordinary claim that from Jerusalem to Il-
> claimed. He has catalyzed a viral church-planting movement that
> regions now complete, he writes to the Romans about his intention
> But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions,
> so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and
> company for a while. (15:23–24)
> churches in his wake, some in large commercial centers like Ephe-
> direction of indigenous leaders. While some are called to similarly
> “grow home” and never despise the wonderful task of taking a com-
> hood, town, or village for the purpose of contextualized mission.

## Bringing It All Home

While all this talk of neighborhood and parish might seem tame and mundane, we suggest that the decision to take a group of believers deep into their own locality will lead to the inevitable risk and adventure of Christian mission. For Abraham Hang in Andong, the risks have been enormous. He has been threatened by the authorities and misunderstood by the broader Christian community.

He has willingly embraced the poverty of his village. But even the venture of stepping deeply into your safe, suburban neighborhood poses a serious risk. Acouple of interesting examples might bring this idea home.

> In a Trailer Park in Tomball, Texas

Bob and Cathie Baldwin are a well-to-do couple who, after a stint in London where Bob worked as an executive with oil giant Enron, returned to semirural Tomball, Texas, where Cathie could indulge her love of horses on their ten-acre property. By their own admission, they were a typical Texan family. Bob was a successful corporate type, and they attended church regularly, kept a beautiful home, and enjoyed the good life in the “exurbs.” The only blight on their picture-perfect life was an unsightly mobile home park a few hundred yards from their property. For the most part they managed to ignore the park and its mainly Hispanic residents, until the sewage system failed, and after complaints from the Baldwins and their other neighbors, the state authorities shut it down. Satisfied with their victory over their poor neighbors, the Baldwins assumed that would be the end of it, but the park owners eventually managed to The Risk of Neighborliness find a way to reopen. They cut the number of mobile homes from forty to twenty and used the extra land to develop an on-site waste treatment system. The Baldwins weren’t thrilled with this, but at least they had halved the size of the park.

However, some time later, the owners applied for a permit to discharge the park’s treated waste into the state’s water system. It was their plan to increase their capacity to fifty-five mobile homes.

To the Baldwins this meant war.

At no point did Bob and Cathie stop to consider the possibility that they had any responsibility toward their poorer neighbors. They didn’t ever seek, nor desire, any kind of relationship with them, even though they attended church every Sunday and, no doubt, heard regularly about the gospel imperative toward neighborliness. Instead, they and their other wealthy neighbors hired an environmental lawyer and set off to fight the park owner’s application. They attended hearings, wrote submissions, and briefed their legal team, but never once did they step foot inside the trailer park itself, even though it was just down the road from their home.

It wasn’t until the judge hearing the case ordered them to inspect the park for themselves that the Baldwins even thought of walking through the gates and talking to the owner and the residents. What happened that day eventually changed the direction of Bob and Cathie’s life. As they walked through the park, a very clear thought came to Bob, one he later believed to be from God: “If you don’t like the way this park is being run, why don’t you run it?” God was calling him to grow home, to see this place as his place, to embrace the missional vocation of neighborliness. But Bob was used to seeing his church as a Sunday experience and one that he drove out of town to enjoy. He wasn’t ready to see church sprout from the soil of a trailer park just yet. But God had more in store for him.

In the end the judge denied the park owner’s application, leaving him unable to expand his business and facing financial ruin. Shortly after, he put the mobile home park up for sale, a defeated man.

In the meantime, God brought various people across the Baldwins’ path, all of whom provoked them to start reading some contemporary missiology. As Bob and Cathie continued to digest material from the missional church movement, it slowly dawned on them that God might have placed them in Tomball for a very particular reason. And Bob couldn’t stop thinking about what he heard about running the park himself.

The last straw happened one Sunday when Bob looked down the pew and saw his defeated neighbor, the park owner, fellowshipping in the same church as he. This was too much for him. Adeep conviction fell on him, and he realized that he was comfort-centered and self-focused, while in the Spirit he should have been mission-centered and other-focused.

> I saw myself as a comfort-worshiping idolator. I did those things,
> even things for God, that kept or made me comfortable. My false
> gods were comfort and personal peace. Like Isaiah in the presence
> Bob and Cathie went straight out and bought the trailer park.

Friends of theirs, former missionaries in Latin America, moved into the manager’s on-site house. Then these two families set about transforming the run-down park into a place of peace. They trimmed trees, landscaped the park, and regularly mowed the grass. They relocated the trailers that were right near a busy road further back into the park. They paved the roads and driveways, and installed streetlights and a new off-site sewage treatment system. They painted or renovated the dilapidated trailers. They built a community center in the middle of the park and ran English classes and computer skills workshops, and soon a small church started meeting there, including the Baldwins. Since then, Bob and Cathie have purchased another twenty-six acres of adjoining land. It is their intention to keep much of it untouched as a wooded play area for the local kids and to stave off the encroachment of suburbia. Their fear was that developers would level everything around them and build gated communities, leaving the trailer park isolated. They are helping to make a community. They are doing what Wendell Berry challenged us all to do: love your neighbor—not the neighbors you pick out, but the ones you have. For the Baldwins, their neighbors are 95 percent Hispanic, many undocumented, many unemployed. What they are doing with their trailer park is now spilling over to the wealthier neighbors around them who are getting on board with helping to shape a wider community of love, grace, and truth. No one knows The Risk of Neighborliness where this will go, but Bob Baldwin, formerly of Enron, is now a missionary in his own neighborhood, building a diverse group of locals into a marvelous expression of communitas.

Part of the problem for the traditional church today is that in many places it is not seen as being for the neighborhood. Like Bob Baldwin before his trailer park revelation, many churches see the social problems of their neighborhood as excuses for their judgment and condemnation, rather than as opportunities for service and partnership. If, however, churches were to take the Hiebert model of critical contextualization seriously, they would be more concerned about “reading” the culture of their neighborhood, looking for what God is saying about their neighbors.

> And on the Streets of South London

Another example of this can be found in the United Kingdom, where for over fifteen years, hundreds of Christians have embraced the challenge to respond to the social needs of their neighborhoods through a missional initiative called Street Pastors. In the entertainment precincts of towns and suburbs across the United Kingdom, late-night revelers stumble out of pubs and bars in the early hours of the weekend mornings, often engaging in all manner of antisocial behavior. Given that binge-drinking, violence, and public mischief are all part of the young adult party culture across the United Kingdom, many of the local residents found that Friday and Saturday nights were like war zones right outside their homes.

But rather than condemning revelers or the licensees of the pubs, the local churches banded together to form Street Pastors, small teams of chaplains who patrol the entertainment precincts to listen to, care for, and practically help those revelers who are disoriented or distressed. Here is part of a report from England’s Telegraph newspaper: It is 1am on a Friday night in Sutton, a south London suburb, where 4,000 people will queue to get into—then stumble out of—bars and night clubs over the next few hours. Most are young, drunk and potentially vulnerable. Rosie has missed her last train home and wants to know where to get a night bus. Elspeth is dealing with a paralytic friend who cannot stand up. Claire is in tears because her friends used fake ID to get into a club and left her outside. There is not a policeman in sight, but help of a holier kind is at hand. I am on patrol with eight “street pastors”: people so concerned about the numbers of young people out drinking that they head to high streets every Friday night to deal with the fallout. They are part of an inter-denominational Christian group of adults moving out of their middle-class, middle-aged comfort zones to make the streets feel safer while they are on patrol.18

> Street Pastors now patrol over 100 locations across the United

Kingdom and involve hundreds of volunteers of all ages, from young adults to elderly people. They are not vigilantes. They are not there to “clean up the streets.” They leave law-and-order initiatives to the local police. They simply listen and care. And their presence has seen the incidence of violence and related crime drop dramatically.

Politicians and community leaders have been quick to praise the Street Pastors, with London’s Lord Mayor Boris Johnson calling it an “extraordinary and inspiring movement,” which he sees as a key part of reducing violence on the streets.19 David Burrowes, a member of the English Parliament, has said, Street Pastors is about Christians rolling up their sleeves and getting involved in practically responding to the problems of crime and safety.

They are like beacons on our streets and I want to see them shining brightly in every constituency.20

At the same time, each Street Pastor team is a communitas—a tight collective, united around a common goal. Whether patrolling The Risk of Neighborliness the streets outside pubs and nightclubs, or assisting drunks back home, they are bound by their common cause—to care for others and to make a safe home for all their neighbors.

Communitas, liminality, and adventure sound like exciting prospects, but sadly many Christian leaders hear these ideas in a kind of cultural limbo. But these concepts are not abstract ideas. They are only possible in the very real context of neighborhood, of locality.

Going back to the missional matrix, the opportunity for communitas is only possible with the mobilization of communities of believers into societal engagement. Short-term mission trips are fine as far as that goes, but they are often manageable, bite-sized experiences to compensate us for the fact that we should see our own homes as mission fields, our own neighborhoods as liminal spaces, our own culture as the sphere of adventure to which we’ve all been called.

Don’t Just Do Something, Sit There!

Part of the problem with the traditional approach is that the church often blunders into a neighborhood with a preconceived idea of what is wanted or needed. Often we try to simply duplicate strategies we’ve seen work elsewhere. If we are to do what the Baldwins or the Street Pastors or Abraham Hang have done, we need to embrace missional proximity. We need to get to know our neighborhood, intimately and without presuppositions or prejudgments. This is what Paul Hiebert was suggesting when he talks about doing exegesis on our culture.

Recently, Michael heard Stuart Murray Williams and Juliet Kilpin of Urban Expression in the United Kingdom speak on this very subject. Stuart alerted us to Jesus’s use of the mustard tree as an image of the kingdom of God. He pointed out that it is not literally true, as Jesus said, that the mustard tree is the largest tree of all. Some trees like the cedar grow far taller. But the mustard tree is a sprawling, bushy shrub that sends out this massive unruly root system. It can be harder to uproot a mustard tree than a far taller cedar.

Stuart said when we look for signs of the kingdom, we often look for the big things, but maybe Jesus saw the kingdom as spreading and persistent. Stuart’s advice was not to try to plant massive churches but to cultivate churches with deep roots—like a spreading weed that will not go away. Alot of traditional church planting strategies are aimed at cultivating cedar-like trees. But if we take our neighborhood more seriously and engage more seriously in relational proximity and cultural exegesis, we could end up planting mustard bushes, deeply rooted and vastly spreading.

Juliet’s advice was to reverse the old maxim, “Don’t just sit there, do something.” Often we run launch ministries just for the sake of doing something, anything. What if we stopped doing something and just sat there in our context? Surely this would create a far richer familiarity with our neighbors, and them with us. Her suggestions included:

1. Listen to the rhythms of your context. Sit in local places. Hang

out in local coffee shops. Talk to local people. Join community groups.

2. Be employed in the neighborhood. Be free of being so driven

by results. Stop measuring your success by how many people attend, and start measuring it by what God is doing in your context.

3. Engage in snowball research. That is, meet the community

gatekeepers, the movers and shakers. Listen to them. Hear of their dreams for your neighborhood. Who knows, they may be the persons of peace referred to in Luke 10.

4. Get rid of your church building!! Well, Juliet was being cheeky

here, but she pointed out that many churches don’t engage in their neighborhood because they are too locked into their building. If you got rid of it, you’d have no choice but to go and engage with the community.

5. Say yes to every Invitation you receive. Follow Jesus’s advice

his disciples in Luke 10 and accept all offers of hospitality.

Say yes to every party, every meal, every committee you get invited to attend.

This last piece of advice reminds us of the Jim Carrey film Yes Man, in which Carrey’s morose character Carl attends a self-help seminar and is told that if he simply says yes to everything, his life will be changed for the better. The word no must be eliminated from his vocabulary. Lonely and dissatisfied, Carl is desperate enough to The Risk of Neighborliness accept this ridiculous challenge and ends up giving all his money to a homeless guy, learning Korean, and dating a Persian woman.

But he also deepens his friendship with those he had neglected, he makes new friends, he meets the girl of his dreams and eventually finds success in his career.

What would happen if we as Christians took the risk of saying yes to everything? What groups would we join? At whose table would we find ourselves eating? What adventures would we end up having?

Whenever we’ve posed this question to groups or classes, we find it is met with some resistance by a few Christian leaders. What, they ask, would we say if invited to visit a strip club or to watch pornography?

But we wonder why church leaders always assume these worst-case scenarios. Of course, we should resist invitations to illicit behavior, but our educated guess is that you’ll be invited to a great many more innocent activities before something like that comes up.

Michael recently met a Baptist minister in Oregon who had been regularly invited by his neighbor to join him and several other men of his street for a margarita in the shed in his backyard. Apparently his neighbor concocted famous homemade margaritas, and all the neighborhood men regularly gathered to drink them and chill out in his “man cave.” After politely rejecting the offer several times, the Baptist minister finally agreed, and a whole new missional world opened up to him.

In Bangalore, India, an English missionary working and living in a slum community was invited to join a committee to lobby the city to provide the slum with a post box. I nitially, he considered this a trivial matter and unworthy of his higher calling to preach the gospel, but he reluctantly agreed, thinking it a simple clerical assignment.

It turned out that the slum wanted a post box because that would provide them with a postal code (or zip code), which would make them a bona fide neighborhood, which would mean the authorities couldn’t evict them any time they liked. By saying yes to this challenge, he was drawn into an eighteen-month-long struggle with the city hall. He was beaten up. He was scorned and mocked. But he found a powerful solidarity with his neighborhood, and when he finally helped them to secure their post box, he knew he had entered into this community more deeply and more missionally than if he’d simply went about the slum preaching.

In the East Bay Area of northern California, two young men heard us speaking about missional living and decided to go to their nearest Burger King and distribute coupons for free burgers to the homeless and the indolent young men who hung around the parking lot. One hungry man was so grateful for the free burger, he invited the two young Christians to join him in an indoor bowling competition at a nearby pub. Nervous about accepting this Invitation because they didn’t drink, and mindful of the sermons they’d heard in their church about not entering such premises, they agreed tentatively. They now have more nonchurch friends than ever and have managed to share their faith and offer acts of kindness on scores of occasions.

With all our talk of risk taking and adventure we might have inadvertently given the impression you needed to jump off a cliff or move to the darkest part of the Amazon to be missional, but we firmly believe that it takes courage to simply say yes to the requests and invitations of our neighbors. We firmly believe the mission field is in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Bangalore, India, but it’s also in your next-door neighbor’s shed or the local Burger King. We’ve seen people finding their mission field in a bar in Birmingham, England; in a bead shop in Glasgow, Scotland; in an art gallery in Sydney, Australia; and in a cul-de-sac in Edmonton, Canada.

We firmly believe that when a community of believers embraces the challenge to move out from within themselves, to serve others, to listen to others, to help build a home where God sends them, and to announce that the kingdom is at hand in word and deed, the true essence of what it is to be the people of God can be experienced in all the richness and beauty and messiness and joy as it was originally intended.
