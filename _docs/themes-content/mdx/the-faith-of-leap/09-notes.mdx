### Chapter 1: The Spirit's Edge

1. D. H. Lawrence, “Escape.”
2. The religious dimension heightens the sense of existence to an immeasurable degree.

For instance, "the sliding of our existence over a scale on which every point is simultaneously determined by the effect of our strength and our abandonment to impenetrable things and powers—this problematic nature of our position in the world, which in its religious version results in the insoluble question of human freedom and divine predetermination, lets all of us become adventurers." Georg Simmel, The Adventure #13 OR SHOULD THIS BE #27? http://condor.depaul.edu/~dweinste/theory/adventure.html. Originally published as "Das Abenteuer," Phiosophische Kultur. Gesammelte Essays, Trans. David Kettler, 2nd ed. (Leipzig: Alfred Kroner, 1919).

17. Kotter, 47. Furthermore he notes in chapter 3 that tactics that aim at the heart have

five key characteristics:

1. They are thoughtfully created human experiences (not just documents and abstract

ideas).

2. They work on all the senses, not just the ears. They can be compelling, surprising,

or dramatic in ways that influence our emotions.

3. They elicit the right kinds of emotions and make people feel that they can accomplish what is needed, that the crisis can be an opportunity.

4. The experience does not need an explanation. It is not covert or manipulative but

it avoids saying in words what is difficult to say or hear.

5. It leads us to raise our sights and to emotionally embrace new goals. (47–49)

5. Ibid., 69. He goes on to note that “Anglican theologian John Milbank argues that

‘virtue cannot properly operate except when collectively possessed.’ This is never truer than when talking about courage. Courage requires community, both for the learning of courage and the living of it. And this community is not just of the present, but of all those who have gone before us. In the reading of Scripture and the remembrance of the saints, we recall all those who have embodied courage in the past. We remember them and pray for the strength to imitate them” (69).

6. This chapter is a summary of what we have previously written and is drawn largely

from Exiles (Peabody: Hendrickson, 2006) 108–25, and The Forgotten Ways (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2007), chap. 8.

8. See Turner, The Ritual Process, 129. He calls communitas anti-structure because the

participant finds himself outside of the normal structured existence of the community as he knew it.

Notes

6. The marks of the church are treated in The Confession of the English Congregation at

Geneva (1556); the French Confession of Faith (1559), articles 26–28; the Scottish Confession of Faith (1560), chapters 16 and 18; the Belgic Confession of Faith (1561), articles 27–29; Second Helvetic Confession (1566), chapter 17.

7. In the following discussion, our comments are narrowly focused upon the identity of

the true church in an institutional sense. Because the believer’s connection to the institutional church comes within the context of the local congregation, that is the focal point of our inquiry. In an enlarged discussion of related themes, we could explore the differences between the visible church and the invisible church. The Scriptures clearly make a distinction between the universal church of all ages, the elect, “the heavenly Jerusalem the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven” (Heb. 12:22–23) and the local congregations which are composed of those in outward communion with the assemblies of Christ. Thus, the historic Protestant creeds distinguish between the visible church and the invisible church (cf. Westminster Confession [1646], chapter 25; the Scottish Confession of Faith [1560], chapters 16 and 18). Obviously our discussion pertains mainly to the visible church, regarding its proper identification: that is, how it may be discerned among local congregations.

8. This is not the place to explore our belief that the central confession of the church

remains “Jesus is Lord!” and is therefore primarily Christological in nature. We worship the Father, through the Son, and in the power of the Spirit. For thorough examination of this, see our book re Jesus.

9. See Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways, 90–92.
10. W. Vaus, Mere Theology: A Guide to the Thought of C. S. Lewis (Downer’s Grove:

InterVarsity, 2004), 167.

11. Bosch defines mission this way: “Mission takes place where the church, in its total

involvement with the world, bears its testimony in the form of a servant, with reference to unbelief, exploitation, discrimination and violence, but also with reference to salvation, healing, liberation, reconciliation and righteousness. Mission is not competition with other religions, not a conversion activity, not expanding the faith, not building up the kingdom of God; neither is it social, economic, or political activity. And yet, there is merit in all these projects. So, the church’s concern is conversion, church growth, the reign of God, economy, society and politics—but in a different manner! The [mission of God] purifies the church. It sets it under the cross—the only place where it is ever safe. The cross is the place of humiliation and judgment, but it is also the place of refreshment and rebirth....

Looked at from this perspective mission is, quite simply, the participation of Christians in the liberating mission of Jesus, wagering on a future that verifiable experience seems to belie. It is the good news of God’s love, incarnated in the witness of a community, for the sake of the world.” Bosch, Transforming Mission, 519.

Alan Hirsch is the founding Director of Forge Mission Training Network. He is the cofounder of shapevine. com, and currently he leads an innovative learning program called Future Travelers, helping numerous megachurches become missional movements. Known for his innovative approach to mission, Alan is a teacher and key mission strategist for churches across the Western world. His popular book The Shaping of Things to Come (with Michael Frost) is widely considered to be a seminal text on mission. Alan’s book The Forgotten Ways has quickly become a key reference for missional thinking, particularly as it relates to missional movements. His book ReJesus (again with Frost) is a radical restatement about the role Jesus plays in defining Christian movements. Untamed (with his wife Debra) is about missional discipleship for a missional church. His most recent book, Right Here, Right Now (with Lance Ford), is about everyday mission for anyone.

Alan’s experience in leadership includes leading a local church movement among the marginalized, developing training systems for innovative missional leadership, and heading up the Mission and Revitalization work of his denomination. He is series editor for the Shapevine Missional book series as well as an associate editor for Leadership Journal. Alan is an adjunct professor at Fuller Seminary, George Fox Seminary, and Wheaton, and lectures frequently throughout Australia, Europe, and the U.S.

Michael Frost is professor of evangelism and missions at Morling College in Sydney, Australia, and a Baptist minister. He is the author of Exiles: Living Missionally in a Post-Christian Culture and the coauthor of The Shaping of Things to Come: Innovation and Mission for the 21st-Century Church and ReJesus: A Wild Messiah for a Missional Church.
