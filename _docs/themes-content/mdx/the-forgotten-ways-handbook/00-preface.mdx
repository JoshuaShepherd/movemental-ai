# Preface

As I write this preface, The Forgotten Ways has been out for around fifteen months. I can say that I have been genuinely humbled by the positive reception it has received. As an author I receive a lot of feedback through letters and e-mails or in person, and the nature of the feedback varies significantly. But by far the most common response I get from readers is, “I know this sounds strange, but I feel that I kind of ‘remember’ these ideas even though I have never been able to fully articulate them.” At which point I usually say “hallelujah,” because for me it is an affirmation of the whole idea behind The Forgotten Ways—that Apostolic Genius lies latent in all of God’s people, and we have simply forgotten how to access it. We have become so numbed by the opiate of institutional religion that we have simply lost contact with the memory of what we can, and ought, to be. Another reason for my elation is that I believe the Spirit is indeed waking his people up to their hidden potential all across the world. The new emergence of apostolic movements is a global phenomenon, as far as I can tell, and it really is quite remarkable. We have cause for great hope.

But yet another response usually comes in the form of a question: “How can the ideas in The Forgotten Ways be implemented?” Most readers find themselves in organizations that feel worlds away from the movement ethos described in the book, even though they long to move in that direction. It is important to know that in writing The Forgotten Ways I never intended to develop a missional technique, but rather to awaken a lost imagination. We must go deep into our collective memories as God’s people and “remember” the forgotten ways of apostolic movements. We need to think and dream and have our imaginations charged with possibilities and our hearts inspired by Jesus afresh. This workbook is not meant to short-circuit that much-needed recalibration, but rather to “operationalize” it.

To do this I needed some help. So I invited Darryn Altclass, a long-time friend and colleague, to write this book with me. Darryn is a dedicated and very savvy church planter who has consistently implemented much of the content of The Forgotten Ways into real-life practice over many years. He knows me well; we have worked closely together in Forge Mission Training Network and have shared many missional ideas and dreams together over the years. As a local movement pioneer; Darryn initiated Third Place Communities, which we use as the primary test case in the book. We have chosen this network not because of any supposed superiority, but simply because we have both traveled with it over the past few years as they have tried to integrate, with some degree of success, The Forgotten Ways into their common life.

We also received some needed guidance from friend and colleague Steve Ogne, an experienced trainer, coach, consultant, and author who works for CRM. Steve helped out with summarizing the information and was a faithful sounding board. We thank him for his insightful input along the way.

It’s hard not to be perfectionistic about a book like this. I’m not sure if we would ever feel it fits the bill, but we offer it to you nonetheless. More importantly, we offer it to God in the hope that he might use it in the advancement of his kingdom in this critical century.

Sola Dei Gloria.

## A Note to Leaders

The fact that you have begun to read this book indicates not only that you are interested in the theory of the forgotten ways, but that at some level you long to activate them in your own life and in the lives of around you. This is exactly why we wrote this book.

This is not a theoretical book on mission or missional movements, although it does contain some theory. Rather, it’s a practical handbook to provide frameworks and offer suggestions as a means to inspire God’s people into mission. Our main purpose is to stir innovative missional action for Jesus in this post-Christian world we inhabit. More specifically, this handbook is a guide to the application of the ideas contained in The Forgotten Ways. We suggest you use it as a handbook, a kind of missional journal as you engage the world in mission. Make the book your own, use it well, take notes in the margins, underline, carry it with you, and jot down your ideas and reflections on the road.

Feedback suggests that many who have read The Forgotten Ways resonate deeply with the vision of the church articulated within the book. A lot of people reported they felt they were actually “remembering” something they had somehow forgotten, and that they gained a clearer insight into the life force (what Alan calls “Apostolic Genius”) that pulsates through the early church and similar movements. We believe that the reason for this “remembering” is that Apostolic Genius actually resides in all authentic expressions of ecclesia, which has simply become dormant over time.

Many long to see something more akin to movements in the various churches and organizations to which they belong. However, they feel the reality of seeing that fulfilled is way beyond their grasp. Others who find themselves deeply embedded within various expressions of Christendom sense that it’s an impossible task to transition their church into a missional movement.

Make no mistake; the scope of the change required to shift to the kind of movement described in The Forgotten Ways is nothing less than paradigmatic. Every element of mDNA (the name given to the components that together encode and form Apostolic Genius) poses a direct challenge to the prevailing ways of doing church and mission. When taken together, all six elements of Apostolic Genius might make the task seem somewhat overwhelming, but it is not as difficult as it seems, and certainly not impossible. The Chinese church proves that highly institutionalized forms of Christianity can actually become powerful transformative movements, given the right circumstances. And for the record, we don’t believe we need persecution to activate Apostolic Genius. Less intense forms of adaptive challenges can, and do, force the church to respond. Because the church carries the gospel and by the power of the Spirit, the full coding of Apostolic Genius, the potential for world transformation is always present. God is able and very willing to empower the church to fulfill her missional calling. In fact, we see this as one of the very special works of the Holy Spirit—to awaken God’s people to their calling and destiny as a movement that can and will change the world.

Akin to the idea of waking up to something long forgotten, we believe the church itself will “remember” the forgotten ways of apostolic movements. For this to happen, leaders will need to create the right environment and give meaningful vocabulary to what people are experiencing. This is precisely what we wish to achieve in writing this book—to make the forgotten ways, well... less forgotten.

Our hope is to help you, at whatever level (grassroots or strategic leadership), in whatever form of Christian organization, to reactivate the missional church where you are. We propose to do this by suggesting a set of habits and practices formed around each of the mDNA elements described in The Forgotten Ways. We believe this will allow us to “remember” once again what it means to be a transformative movement for Jesus in the West.

What's Inside?

Each chapter is structured in the same way, so that the users can expect some degree of uniformity. This approach basically comprises three sections.

1. A Summary of Each mDNA Element

This will provide the participant with an adequate overview of each chapter and mDNA element. It is relatively free of jargon, so it should be understandable by most. However, when somewhat technical phrases are retained, it will be the leader’s task to explain them in a meaningful way.

There is a glossary at the back of the book to help with this.

2. Suggested Habits and Practices

You will notice that after each summary we have arranged the practical section into Habits and Practices. Habits are the overall behavior we suggest groups adopt in order to appropriate the specific mDNA element, while practices are helpful ideas for living out the habits. The practices are simply proposed ways in which to act out or embody the habit in everyday life.

Habits can be viewed as the framework of a ladder, and the practices as the rungs on which we place our feet.

Please note that these are suggested habits and practices. They are prompts, not prescriptions. Don’t try doing them all; you will only exhaust yourself. In fact, you might not choose any of the ones we have suggested, but we hope that in that case, they might function simply as a stimulus for you to find your own.

3. A Group Learning Process

We wrote this book with a group context in mind. While people might choose to read the book in their own time, we recommend that the information is better processed with others. Our hope is that the information and examples contained within this book will prompt rich discussion and will lead groups into missional action. This is why we have called them action groups.

For this purpose you will find at the end of each chapter a set of questions for groups to use as a way to process and apply the principles. We believe that this is where great learning will occur as together you explore, evaluate, and begin to employ these concepts in community life. Here’s an overview of the framework we suggest for group processing.

Session 1: Explore (talk about it) In preparation please ensure everyone reads the chapter. Start with an overview of the mDNA element, to clarify the theme and associated concepts. If there are words or ideas people are not clear about, this is the time to clarify. It’s a good idea for one person to take responsibility to guide this section, and for that person to have read (and understood) the associated chapter from The Forgotten Ways.

After the overview, explore the ideas and suggestions presented in the chapter. The exploration phase is highly relational and probes people’s initial responses and feelings. Ask a few open-ended exploratory questions to allow the group space to share and think out loud. This is a good way to discern what’s on the surface of people’s minds and hearts and in need of discussion.

Session 2: Evaluate (reflect deeper) While the exploration section encourages general sharing and relating, the evaluation phase is where deeper reflection and critical thinking occurs.

During this time ask questions and make statements that promote critical thinking. These questions will prompt the group to prioritize and brainstorm various options and alternatives. This is also where you identify blockages and resistance and sort out what is important and what is not.

Session 3: Employ (act on it) The employing section is about moving the group into action. By this stage the group has explored the ideas through talking generally, evaluated by reflecting more deeply, identified barriers, and has begun to sort out what’s important and what’s not. Now it’s time to probe the way ahead.

What plan of action will the group employ as a way forward? This is where the group can start to refocus and respond by brainstorming and mapping out various options and action steps. What will they need to let go? What will they need to pick up? Who will they need help from? During this phase ask questions and make statements to provoke action.

## Session 4: Personal Journal

After processing much information, we encourage you to take some time to pray, listen and respond to God. How is God prompting you, and how will you respond? Take time to record your impressions as well as insights from the group. Write a prayer expressing your desires to God. If appropriate, share your thoughts in the group, and then pray together.

There are two other sections in the book, both found at the back.

Resource Section We have included an appendix with relevant resources and examples that are referred to throughout the book. Due to the interrelated nature of Apostolic Genius, these resources are relevant to many different sections.

That’s why we’ve placed them together in a general resource section at the back. Just flick over to this section when needed or prompted.

Glossary Because the primary book contains phrases and terms that might be obscure to many, we have included here the glossary (dictionary of terms used) from The Forgotten Ways. Feel free to read it first to familiarize yourself with some of these definitions. Rest assured, it will all become clearer as you go.

## A Call to Action

To avoid the group becoming just another discussion group, we suggest you call them action groups or something to that effect. We don’t want to foster mere understanding, but rather informed action. Whether you are using this book to guide a group of cell leaders or a small group trying to activate their cell, think of the handbook as a guide to the revolution, and of each member as an active participant in the movement. Remember that each and every Christian has the seed-potential for world transformation. Each can and must play a part. To embed a movement ethos throughout the church or organization, we suggest you recruit as many people as possible for the journey.

We recommend that someone assumes responsibility for coordinating the action group. The handbook is a standalone text, but it’s very important that at least one person in the group has thoroughly read The Forgotten Ways, perhaps even twice, so that they can act as informed guides along the journey. Leadership always necessitates a deeper appreciation of the issues.

Whoever it is, this person should take responsibility at the beginning of each meeting to conduct the overview and to make sure everyone comprehends the basic ideas and terminology associated with Apostolic Genius.

Alternatively, given that a great way to learn an idea is to actually teach it to others, you might like to suggest every member of the group takes a turn in teaching the overview. Given the complexity of the material at times, you might divide a chapter into two and distribute it to two different participants.

What follows is important information on how to get the most out of this handbook and maximize impact in your church and organization.

> How to Apply the Apostolic Genius Model

There is no magic formula in using this handbook to apply the many ideas contained in The Forgotten Ways. Much will depend on both your context and the commitment of the group to search for the answers and then apply them in your situation. But we do suggest the following:

1. Get as many to read the primary text as possible.

This is especially true for the key and influential leaders in the group.

We recognize that The Forgotten Ways is a comprehensive text containing complex terminology and that it introduces many different paradigm shifts in how we think of church and movements. The reason for this comprehensiveness is to dislodge our thinking from the prevailing ideas and forms that seem to exercise a monopoly over our imaginations. We have so wedded our thinking of church to the institution that we no longer easily recognize a more dynamic Jesus movement when we see it. It is critical that we engage our minds and hearts in the quest to recover the forgotten ways of apostolic movements.

2. Get a Realistic Perspective on Change

Every group must deal with the issue of how long it will take to see Apostolic Genius genuinely embedded in the group or church. It is our clear belief that an established church can become significantly missional, but to do so the leaders will need to have a clear perspective on the change process needed to get this done. To a large degree this will depend on the situation of the organization when it starts the process. However, we are certain that to fully transform an existing organization will take significant time. However long you decide to take in study and applying the suggested practices, we encourage you to be patient, prayerful, and committed to sustain long-term change. Don’t look for short-term solutions when the issues you deal with are complex. (You may want to read “A Crash Course in Chaos” in the addendum of The Forgotten Ways and try developing a change process along similar lines.1)

3. Embed mDNA at the Core of the Organization/Church

In applying the Apostolic Genius model, it is essential to seek to implant mDNA at the very heart of the group. If you are a new church planter, then you have at least one advantage: you can clearly lay down the basic movemental approach and get it right from the start. If not a new church, then you will need to choose a strategic point of departure (see #5 below). Either way, to embed mDNA you will need to make sure that each member of your core team grapples with the ideas contained in The Forgotten Ways and begin to pre-empt how they might be integrated as you go. Much depends on what you build into the “stem cells” of the church.

Corrupted DNA in any organism can cause mutations and problems later on, so don’t be afraid to be a stickler about getting it right at the foundational level. But leaders will have to keep their eye on things as they develop, because there is an innate tendency in all organizations to institutionalize over time. We have to assume that each member has most likely been deeply shaped by the institutional idea of church in its many forms. You will need to work hard to disembed the inherited imagination where it blocks the appropriation of Apostolic Genius (the combination of the six elements of mDNA).

4. Think Systems

The Forgotten Ways provides us with a system, a way of seeing movements in their wholeness. It is not a one-dimensional look at the simple characteristics of movements; rather, it describes the phenomenon of movements in their wholeness—as a system of interrelating and interconnected elements. The claim made in The Forgotten Ways is that the Apostolic Genius typology actually applies to all Jesus movements that achieve hyperbolic growth, or, as Roland Allen calls it, “spontaneous expansion.” The Forgotten Ways is an attempt to describe the essential elements that come together and inform one another to create hyperbolic growth curves and high impact. Because the Apostolic Genius typology is a system, it is critical that you keep your eye on the whole while focusing on any of the singular elements. Never lose sight of the fact that a true apostolic movement needs all six elements to make it cook.

5. Use the Apostolic Genius Typology as a Strategic Tool

The user can adopt the Apostolic Genius typology to assess how close the organization is to being a genuine movement. It also can be used as a tool for strategic focus. For instance, taking the Apostolic Genius approach, you can assess the organization and identify the weakest elements. We suggest that the weakest element of mDNA then becomes the focus of strategic effort for that organization. Once that is developed over time, then the same process is undertaken to identify the next-weakest element, and that becomes the focus of effort until it is further developed, and so on. How do you do the assessment? If you can’t develop your own, then there is a thoroughly researched online test available to help you in this regard. Go to www. theforgottenways. org, and you can take the missional fitness test there as regularly as you need to.2

6. Resist Temptation to Use Any Single Element as a Silver Bullet Do not succumb to the temptation to treat any of the mDNA elements within itself as some sort of silver bullet, a quick cure for the ailments of your church. While developing one, say, discipleship, is likely to enhance the church, if you are seeking to engender apostolic movements, then none of the elements by themselves will be enough. Even though developing one will contribute to the whole system, it takes all six to create an apostolic movement. Each is necessary but not sufficient.

7. Create Real-Life Action Heroes

It is critical that you ensure that people are actually attempting to do what is being discussed and agreed upon. This is a handbook, and its task is not to stimulate conversations that lead nowhere, but to inspire and guide action. The real heroes of the group ought not to be the ones who can master the information intellectually, but rather those who are willing to give things a go and risk failure. You will need to inspire a culture of experimentation imbued with a genuine pioneering spirit.

8. Be Realistic

A word needs to be said about whether churches and organizations in Western contexts can become exactly like the movements described in The Forgotten Ways, namely the early church and the Chinese underground church. The straightforward answer is, probably not—at least not in the same way or to the same degree. There are many reasons for this. One is that we live in a post-Christian context that makes our task more complicated due to the inoculation of our culture against genuine expressions of Christianity.

This is also due to the fact that we do not live in a premodern cultural context, but a postmodern one, where the structure of belief is far more complex. But this should not deter us from applying the Apostolic Genius model to our setting. Grassroots apostolic movements are definitely growing across the West, and in our opinion, they represent the hope and the future of Western Christianity. Not only is becoming a movement a challenge for most of us, but it is one that must be undertaken by as many churches and agencies as possible if we are to reestablish Christianity in the West. Failure here will mean the continuing decline of Christianity in every context in the West— and this is unacceptable to all committed to seeing the gospel appropriated and Jesus worshipped throughout our cities and neighborhoods.

As for the existing organization that finds itself largely bound to the institutional idea of church, this challenge should not be the cause of despair.

Remember that every community that faithfully follows Jesus has all the latent potential already present within them. Our task is not to introduce faddish new ideas, but rather to awaken the collective memory and create the condition in which they can reactivate and reapply Apostolic Genius.

Our suggestion, therefore, is that you start using the strategic process suggested above and thus begin to approximate the kind of church expressed in apostolic movements. It is important to remember that in many ways, the churches and organizations we inhabit will to some degree always be hybrids—a mixture of organic and institutional elements. The challenge for most of us will be to continually move toward being more movemental by increasingly applying the Apostolic Genius typology with its six elements. It is our contention that at a certain catalytic moment, when the six elements are present and interacting in a significant way, spontaneous expansion will begin to occur.

## Rationale for the Handbook

Two interrelated educational philosophies guided the formation of this handbook. First, given our current state of knowledge and how we gain it, we have to shift from trying to think our way into a new way of acting to the process of acting our way into a new way of thinking. The other guiding concept is related to action (praxis) as a basis of insight into God, discipleship, and church. There is a fundamental difference between core values and core practices.

> Acting Our Way into a New Way of Thinking

We are all familiar with the gospel story in which Jesus selected a band of disciples, lived and ministered with them, and mentored them on the road. It was this life-on-life phenomenon that facilitated the transfer of information and ideas into concrete situations. The idea of discipleship will be explored in one of the chapters; we simply note that this is the way Jesus formed his disciples and that we should not think we could generate authentic disciples in any other way.

Please don’t misunderstand us; we do need serious intellectual engagement with the key ideas of our time, but what is truly concerning is that such engagement largely takes place in the disengaged and passive environment of the classroom. This is simply not the way Jesus taught us to develop disciples. And it is not that Jesus lacked an appropriate model of the classroom—the Greeks had developed this hundreds of years before Christ, and it was well entrenched in the Greco-Roman world. The Hebrew worldview was a life-oriented one and was not primarily concerned with concepts and ideas in themselves. We simply do not believe that we can continue to try and think our way into a new way of acting; but rather, we need to act our way into new way of thinking.3 How did we move so far from the ethos of discipleship passed on to us by our Lord? The cause lies in Western Christianity being so deeply influenced by Greek, or Hellenistic, ideas of knowledge. By the fourth century, in the church the Platonic worldview had almost triumphed over the Hebraic one. Later, it was Aristotle who became the predominant philosopher for the church. He too operated under a Hellenistic framework.

Essentially a Hellenistic view of knowledge is concerned about concepts, ideas, and the nature of being. The Hebraic on the other hand, is primarily concerned with issues of concrete existence, obedience, life-oriented wisdom, and interrelationship of all things under God. As Jews, it is quite clear that Jesus and the early church operated primarily out of a Hebraic understanding rather than a Hellenistic one.

The diagram below demonstrates this distinction. If our starting point is old thinking and old behavior, and we see it as our task to change that situation, taking the Hellenistic approach will mean that we provide information to try and get the person or church to a new way of thinking— and hopefully to a new way of acting. The problem is that by merely addressing intellectual aspects we have failed to be able to change behavior.

The assumption in Hellenistic thinking is that if people get the right ideas, they will simply change their behavior. The Hellenistic approach therefore can be characterized as an attempt to try and think our way into a new way of acting. Both experience and history show the fallacy of this approach. And it certainly does not make disciples. All we do is change the way a person thinks, and their behavior remains largely unaffected. Even though gaining knowledge is essential to transformation, we soon discover that it's going to take a whole lot more than new thinking to transform us.

So what is that better way? We mentioned it before. It’s found in the ancient art of disciple making, which operates best with the Hebrew understanding of knowledge. We need to take the whole person into account in seeking to transform an individual, and educate them in the context of life for life. The way we do this, is the way Jesus did it, to act our way into a new way of thinking. So whether we find ourselves with old thinking and old behavior, or new thinking and old behavior, the way forward is to put actions into the equation.

The assumption is that we bring all these dynamic thinking processes with us into our actions. It is all about context, not just content. We do not, as is supposed by the Hellenistic model, leave our thinking behind when we are doing our actions. We think while we are acting, and act while we our thinking. So what we are proposing looks something like this....

At Forge Mission Training Network, we have built the entire system around this concept of action-learning discipleship. Our twin aims are to develop missionaries to the West, along with a distinct pioneering missional mode of leadership. To do this, we host an internship where each intern is placed in an environment of mission. The vast majority of the intern’s learning is by “having a go” in mission. They also meet regularly with a coach for reflection and goal setting, and attend inspiring intensives where they are exposed to a significant amount of theory. This information is communicated by those who have a demonstrated capacity to model what they are teaching—in other words, they are active practitioners in their own right. Engaging in training in this way, the intern’s ability to grasp the issues, to resolve and integrate them, is significantly increased.

## Core Practices vs. Core Values

Closely related to the idea of action-learning described above, is the distinction between core values and core practices. Keep this distinction in mind, because the content of this book is structured around the idea of developing core practices as a means of changing church culture.

Following standard business practice, many churches use the idea of developing core values to help shape organizational culture. The core values, along with vision and mission statements, are created to guide the organization’s activities and shape its culture. The weakness of this approach is that they can easily become mere “motherhood statements,” preferred rather than actual values. If you don’t develop practices based on the values, establishing core values simply becomes an intellectual process rather than informing behavior. It is very hard to change people’s values by referring them to a new set of values on paper that they’re meant to believe in and assimilate into their lives. So we suggest focusing your efforts on a raft of possible practices, which if applied, will inform behavior and so change thinking as a result.

We will suggest this again later, but the process of moving from values to practices can be developed in the following way. Identify the core value you wish to integrate, and state it clearly. Once the idea is clear, work together to ask the question, “What action, if applied, will most consistently embody this core value in the organization?” It’s important to seek to link the action as closely as possible to the ordinary rhythms in life. For example, if a core value of the group is hospitality, don’t just say, “We value hospitality.” Rather, look for natural ways in which the community might actually practice hospitality.

> Calling for a Conspiracy of Little Jesuses

The instinct, power, and genius of the early church rests within the memory of God’s people, and so we call for pioneering mission-hearted groups to stir that memory into action. We honestly believe that the hope of Western Christianity rests within each group of Christians living out their calling to be God’s people in the localities where they work, rest, and play.

If we’re going to impact our world in the name of Jesus, it will be because people like you and me took action in the power of the Spirit. Ever since the mission and ministry of Jesus, God has never stopped calling for a movement of “Little Jesuses” to follow him into the world and unleash the remarkable redemptive genius that lies in the very message we carry. Given the situation of the church in the West, much will now depend on whether we are willing to break out of a stifling herd instinct and find God again in the context of the advancing kingdom of God.

“Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.

Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” —attributed to Johann Wolfgang Goethe

## Notes

It is important that leadership understand the dynamics of change. Abook that takes change processes seriously in relation to missional church is The Missional Leader: Equipping Your Church to Reach a Changing World (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2006) by Alan Roxburgh and Fred Romanuk.

The Missional Test is soon to be released, so keep checking the Web site This very useful phrase is borrowed from the authors of Surfing the Edge of Chaos, 14.
