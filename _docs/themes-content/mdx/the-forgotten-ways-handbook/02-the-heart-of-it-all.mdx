# The Heart of It All

### Jesus Is Lord

When Paul completes his exploration into the mystery of God’s involvement in our world, he soars into an ecstatic doxology: “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! ‘Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?’ ‘Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?’ For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen” (Rom. 11:33–36). The clarity of truth dawns upon Paul in utter simplicity, and through these timeless words he points us to the very core of a Hebraic understanding of God: “for from him and through him and to him are all things.” Here we touch the epicenter of the biblical consciousness of God to which we must return if we are to renew the church in our day.

It is hard to determine where to place material that by its very nature is more than just an “element” of Apostolic Genius. All genuine Christian movements involve at their spiritual core an encounter with the One True God. If we fail to apprehend this spiritual center of the Jesus movements, we can never fully understand them, nor can we invoke the power that infused their lives and communities. While in some sense this is an element of Apostolic Genius, it is actually much more than that. This consciousness of God pervades the entire phenomenon.

### Distilling the Message

Most people, when asked about how they think these remarkable movements grew so amazingly, answer that it was because they were true believers. That is, there was an authenticity to their faith and they were obviously empowered by the Holy Spirit. Any study of the lives of these people cannot fail to inspire. In the context of persecution, they lived very close to their message. They clung to the gospel and unlocked its liberating power. They jettisoned all unnecessary clutter and theological paraphernalia and distilled the message to its essence. Under these conditions, faith was once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus. The gospel became a possession of the people—profoundly grassroots, easy to get, and simple to pass on. These movements “traveled light,” and in the process discovered their true message. At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple Christology—in a very literal sense, they are Jesus movements.

This phenomenon of a movement identifying, distilling, and living by its message is a massive clue to Apostolic Genius and how we can recover it in the West. But in order to distill the message, we need to return to the primary theme of the Bible: God’s redemptive claim over our lives.

### Hear, O Israel

So what was this uncluttered message distilled by these remarkable movements? A study of these groups shows the answer is found in biblical monotheism—an encounter with the One God who claims and saves us.

When the Early Christians confess that “Jesus is Lord,” it wasn’t a simple affirmation that Jesus is our Master and we his servants. It certainly is that, but given the Hebraic context, the confession relates back to Israel’s primary declaration, “Yahweh is Lord.” It touches the deepest currents in biblical revelation that take us directly to the nature of God, his relation to his world, and his claim over every aspect of our lives. It all starts with Israel’s basic confession, the Shema Yisrael (Hear, O Israel) based on Deuteronomy 6:4.

To truly appreciate the power of this claim we need to set it in its original context—that of religious pluralism or polytheism. People living in the ancient Near East were deeply spiritual and recognized that life was filled with the sacred, the mystical, and the magical. There were numerous gods who were seen to rule over every different sphere of life. There was a god of the field, a god of the forest, a god of the river, of politics, of family, of fertility, and so on. The simple action of going to the river to draw water via the field and through the forest was actually quite complex. Every god must be appeased. And into this environment comes the Shema...

Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. (Deut. 6:4–9) This declaration has direct and far-reaching implications. No longer could there be different gods for the various spheres of life. Yahweh is the ONE God who rules over every aspect of life. Yahweh is Lord of home, field, politics, work, etc., and the religious task was to honor this ONE God in and through all aspects of life. It was a call for the Israelite to live his or her life under the lordship of one God and not under the tyranny of the many gods. So in the Hebraic perspective, monotheism is not so much a statement about God in his oneness as it is a claim that there is only one God and he is Lord of all. This “practical monotheism” lies at the epicenter of Israel’s, and therefore the biblical concept, of faith. God is concerned with every aspect of the believer’s life, not just the so-called spiritual dimensions. There is no such thing as sacred and secular in a biblical worldview. It can conceive of no part of the world that does not come under the claim of Yahweh’s lordship. All of life belongs to God, and true holiness means bringing all the spheres under God. This is what constitutes biblical worship.

### Jesus Is Lord

The incarnation does not alter the fundamental practical monotheism of the scriptures; rather, it restructures it around Jesus Christ. He becomes the focal point in our relationship to God. Jesus not only initiates the new covenant; he is the New Covenant. "Jesus is Lord" is the covenant claim of God over our lives—the unshakable center of the Christian creed and confession. When the early church claims "Jesus is Lord," it does so in precisely the same way, and with exactly the same implications that Israel claimed God as Lord in the Shema. Our spiritual forebears really understood the inner meaning of monotheism. They knew that Jesus was Lord and that this lordship effectively excluded all other claims to loyalty. They knew that this was the heart of the faith, and they could not, would not, surrender it.

### The Heart of Things

At its very heart, Christianity is a messianic movement, one that seeks to consistently embody the life, spirituality, and mission of its Founder. We have made it so many other things, but this is its utter simplicity.

Discipleship, becoming like Jesus our Lord and Founder, lies at the epicenter of the church’s task. In order to recover the ethos of authentic Christianity, we need to refocus our attention back to the Root and recalibrate ourselves around Jesus.

A genuinely messianic monotheism therefore breaks down any notions of a false separation between the “sacred” and the “secular.” If the world and all in it belongs to God, then there can be no sphere of life that is not open to the rule of God. There can be no non-God area in our lives or culture.

Consider the following diagrams. The first illustrates a dualistic approach; the second offers an alternative.

Now, using the same elements and realigning them to fit a nondualistic understanding of God, church, and world, we can reconfigure this as follows: Seeing things this way leads us to embrace an all-of-life perspective to our faith. By refusing the false dualism of sacred or secular, and by committing all of our lives under Jesus, we live out true holiness. There is nothing in our lives that should not and cannot be brought under the rule of God. If we fail to do this, then while we might be confessing monotheists, we might end up practicing polytheists. Dualistic expressions of faith always result in practical polytheism. Christ-centered monotheism demands loyalty precisely where the other gods claim it. Make no mistake, we are surrounded by the claims of false gods who clamor for our loyalties—not the least of these the worship of wealth and the associated gods of consumerism.

Sadly, history demonstrates how we as God’s people can so often obscure the centrality of Jesus in our experience of church. There is so much clutter in our “religion” that this central unifying claim that lies at the heart of the faith is easily lost. It is remarkable how Jesus can be so easily cast out from among his people. Have you ever wondered why in Revelation 3:20 Jesus is seen standing outside his church, knocking at the door and asking to come in? How did he get out from among his people in the first place?

This section has sought to identify the epicenter of mDNA and therefore a critical element of Apostolic Genius. The other elements in the structure of mDNA form themselves around and are guided by it. The confession “Jesus is Lord” is a challenge to take seriously the absolute and ongoing centrality of Jesus for Christianity as a movement and for each local gathering. As we have seen, the early Christian movement and the Chinese underground church discovered this as their sustaining and guiding center in the midst of a massive adaptive challenge. No less is required of us as we seek to negotiate the challenge of the twenty-first century. The first step in the revival of Apostolic Genius is the recovery of the lordship of Jesus in its utter simplicity.

Now we’d like to suggest a few habits and practices that promote Jesus as Lord among us.

## Suggested Habits and Practices

In order to recover the heart of Apostolic Genius, we must learn to recalibrate every part of our lives around Jesus. So what does this mean practically for those seeking to become an influential movement in the West?

Here are a few suggestions.

1. Keep Jesus at the heart of it all
2. Get over dualism
3. Make the Gospels the primary text

> Habit 1: Keep Jesus at the Heart of It All

In the remarkable Jesus movements, at the heart of it all the followers’ faith was linked in utter simplicity to Jesus. They shed all unnecessary clutter, embraced a simple Christology, and in the process grew into a grassroots Jesus movement. For them, Jesus was the heart of it all, and they worked hard to keep it that way. Some even died for it. At the very core, Christianity is not a religion but a Jesus-fueled movement that seeks to consistently embody the life, spirituality, and mission of its Founder.

Practice One: Seek a Fresh Perspective on Jesus The first practice we suggest in keeping Jesus at the heart of it all is to seek a fresh perspective on his life and mission. Our particular institutional perspectives and belief systems, with all their trappings, have the potential to cloud the core truths of Christ and his gospel. Over time it’s relatively easy to lose sight of the fundamentals and become caught up in a myriad of other secondary causes. In this case, it’s helpful to bypass all the historical culture and start afresh. We need to take a fresh look at the central person of the faith and return to the unencumbered Christology of the New Testament Church.

- The first followers would have understood Jesus and his teaching primarily through Jewish eyes. To understand Jesus correctly, it's helpful to comprehend Jesus's heritage and the context in which he lived and ministered. From here we can construct a fresh and vibrant Christology.

- Read up on a Jewish perspective of faith. A great place to start is chapter 7, "The God of Israel and the Renewal of Christianity," in Alan's book The Shaping of Things to Come.1 There you will find a helpful overview of looking at Jesus through Hebraic eyes.

- In studying the context in which Jesus lived and ministered, you might like to explore books as a community such as ReJesus by Alan Hirsch and Michael Frost,2 The Jesus Never Knew by Philip Yancey,3 or The Divine Conspiracy by Dallas Willard.4 Other texts, such as Poet & Peasant and Through Peasant Eyes by Kenneth E. Bailey,5 are classics. Working through Stanley Hauerwas's fantastic commentary on Matthew would be a great exercise.6 All of N. T. Wright's material on Jesus is extremely helpful as well.7

- Adopt a standard text that everyone in the community is encouraged to read in the first year. You could also make reading a core text on Christology part of the formation process into the faith community.

- Distill your core message to a simple Christology. If you insist on having a written theological statement, ensure it is secondary and points to a clear understanding of Jesus and what he is to us. Try to avoid making things too complex.

- Watch movies on the life of Jesus; then reflect on them together. Discuss their strengths and weaknesses and their relationship to the Gospel accounts.

- To become familiar with the ways of God in Jesus, read and reread the Gospels (see the habit "Make the Gospels the Primary Text," below).

Practice Two: Shape Life and Spirituality on Jesus The second practice we suggest is to pattern our individual and collective spiritualities on Jesus. He is our model and primary reference point for all genuine expressions of spirituality. The golden questions are, “What did Jesus’s spirituality look like and consist of?” and “How does our spirituality compare?” Reflecting on these two questions is a good place to start.

- As a group, research the spirituality of Jesus, and gather your findings under a few headings. Then, using this as a template, evaluate your own personal and collective spirituality. How do you think you will measure up? Do you imagine you'll go close to matching up? Taking one area at a time, brainstorm ways to shape a more Jesus-centered spirituality across your community.

- Jesus modeled a radical spirituality of engagement with the world. He was known as a friend of sinners. His spirituality was intriguing and magnetic. He ate and drank with prostitutes as well as the religious elite. He touched lepers and socialized with tax collectors and women. In fact his spirituality got him into a lot of trouble with both the religious and civil authorities of the day. What are you and your community known for? Could these same characterizations apply? Why don't you ask those around you? That would be a telling exercise!

- Here's another exercise to reset your communal life on Jesus. As a faith community, evaluate everything you do—all your programs, gatherings, ministries, and so on. Ask whether you think this is what Jesus would be doing if he were in your context. Is this how Jesus would go about incarnating the kingdom in your area?

Record your observations in two columns—one for yes, one for no.

How can the activities and habits that fall into the no column be reshaped? What activities should you stop altogether? What clutter can you discard? Lastly, ask what else there is that hasn’t been thought of. What would Jesus do that you have not even considered.

- Every time you gather, remind one another that you are meeting in

the name of Jesus. Some communities we know light a single candle every time they meet to represent the ongoing presence of Jesus among them and to signify that Jesus is the Light of the World. You might even leave an empty chair in the room to remind you of his presence.

Practice Three: Shape Missional Engagement on Jesus Not only should we pattern our spirituality on Jesus, but we should shape our missional engagement on him as well. In fact, mission is really just an extension or a by-product of a spirituality based on Jesus. His spirituality was one formed around his mission—and it was rugged enough to sustain him in the rough and tumble of his life. If every Christian engaged people as meaningfully, attentively, and redemptively as Jesus did, we would revolutionize the world in no time. Jesus is our primary model of mission.

He is the Seeker and Savior of the lost.

- Hold Jesus up as the prime example of evangelist, social activist,

and missionary. As a community, examine Jesus in the throes of missional engagement. Look at the ways he engaged people, asked questions, listened, and conversed. What can we learn from Jesus?

Together, explore, reflect, pray, and seek to emulate him.

- Astudy into John 5:17–20 will reveal profound insights into how Jesus followed his own Father into mission. This is a great passage to explore together as a group.

- Modeling our missional engagement on Jesus will mean acting like

him in relation to those beyond the faith. We have already noted that he was known as the friend of outcasts and sinners and spent lots of time with those not of the faith.

- Here are a few good questions to ask and reflect upon:

Q. Whom did Jesus spend time with? Whom do we spend time with?

Q. Whom did Jesus eat with? Whom do we eat with? Whom do we invite to our table?

> Practice Four: Shape Leadership on Jesus

Not only should we pattern our spirituality and missional engagement on Jesus, but we should also shape our leadership and leadership development in light of his example. As we suggest later, in the disciple making chapter, leadership is an extension of discipleship, the aim of which is to become more like Jesus. There we note that the quality of the church’s leadership is directly related to the quality of its discipleship. If we fail in making disciples, we will undoubtedly fail in shaping leaders. Leadership emerges from healthy discipleship and, to be genuinely Christian, must always reflect Christlikeness.

- Jesus had no positional or institutional power; rather, he had moral

and spiritual authority. This is the basis of biblical leadership.

Spiritual authority emerges from our relationship with God and is given depth through our calling and personal integrity.

- In developing and commissioning leaders, we should focus on

character rather than gifting and ability. Spiritual leadership is influence through relationships, not by power or position.

- Build leadership development on top of a healthy disciple-making

process. If we get discipleship right, then we are well positioned to develop leaders (see disciple making section for more information).

- Read the Gospels, and explore Jesus’s model of leadership and

leadership development. Discuss as a community and seek to integrate those qualities in your own processes.

- Circulate thought-provoking ideas, articles, and books on Christcentered leadership. In The Name of Jesus: Reflections on Christian Leadership, by Henri Nouwen,8 is a stirring book that highlights Jesus’s servant leadership.

- Develop a list of leadership habits and qualities evident in Jesus, to

use as a template in shaping all leaders in the group. Periodically use this list as an inventory and a self-evaluation tool for every leader.

## Habit 2: Get over Dualism

We have already noted that there was an abiding authenticity to the early believers’ faith that permeated every aspect of their individual and collective lives. Following Jesus effectively excluded all other claims to loyalty. If we honestly seek the same level of authentic faith, we will need to dethrone dualism in our lives.

> Practice One: All-of-Life Alignment

The first practice we suggest in our efforts to dethrone dualism is the practice of all-of-life alignment. When we say all-of-life alignment, we recommend a radical realigning of every aspect of our individual and collective lives around Jesus, his ways and purposes. Seeking to embrace an all-of-life perspective and aligning all areas of life under Jesus deposes dualism as it begins to dismantle the false barrier between the sacred and the secular. It creates a seamless experience between faith and life.

- Evaluate your collective activities and structures using the two

diagrams above as a template (the diagrams with the three circles).

Do your actions and structures fit into the dualistic template or the all-of-life one? What will it mean to realign the elements that fit into the dualistic framework so that all three components—God, world, and church—are integrated?

- Create an all-of-life inventory. Seek to identify the idols in your

individual and collective lives. Be honest, confess to God and one another, and together seek ways to loosen their grip. Develop lifestyle habits and practices that guide you in the opposite direction. For example, if one of the gods was money and consumerism, then there are very specific things you can commit to together as a way to combat this powerful god. Here are a few ideas:

- Every month have a “buy nothing day.”
- Show one another your credit card statements at the end of the

month (we actually know a community that does this—scary, huh?).

- Issue the challenge to abstain from buying coffee, alcohol, or

fast food for a week and to give the money away. One of the best ways to break the spiritual power of money is to give it away.

- Afriend of ours issued a one-week challenge to everyone in

her church. Knowing that many people in the world survive on only one dollar a day for food, the challenge was to keep the cost of meals as low as possible. This activity would surely challenge our use and abuse of both money and food.

- Establish a practice of vocational (work) alignment. If we believe

that every aspect of life should be brought under the lordship of Jesus, then surely this includes our careers. Are we giving our best to wrong causes? Is there space for service in our lives? Can we downsize and scale back in order to focus on spiritually significant things? Seeing that many of us spend close to a third of our days at work, this should be a priority.

NOTE TO EDITOR & DESIGNER—All text STYLED SIDEBAR are examples/extra info. We envisage that all SIDEBAR text will be off to the side directly parallel to the section it relates to. Maybe a lightly shaded background or similar to differentiate it from the other text.

Maybe not in boxes as people tend to avoid info in boxes.

## Missio Dei

Afaith community called Missio Dei upholds the practice of outer transformation. They say, “Acommitment to outer transformation is a commitment to ordering our lives around God’s transforming dream.” Asignificant part of this practice for them is to aim at one act of outward transformation each week that includes vocational alignment. This essentially is a commitment to allow God’s kingdom agenda to order their vocation and working lives.9

> Practice Two: Hallow the Everyday

Secondly, in deposing dualism in our lives, we suggest the practice of attempting to hallow (make holy) the everyday activities of life. This idea comes directly from the Hebraic understanding that there are only two realities in the world: the holy and the not-yet-holy, and that the task of God’s people is to make the not-yet-holy into that which is holy. Here are some suggestions.

- Together, explore this Hebraic view of life. A good place to start is

chapter 7 of The Shaping of Things to Come (especially p. 132).

- Hallowing the everyday is achieved by seeking to focus and direct

our daily tasks toward God and his purposes, not away from him.

It’s about intentionality, mindfulness, and purpose.

- A good question to explore as a group is, "How can we make sacred our everyday ordinary tasks?" How can cleaning be made holy? Shopping? Work? Meeting for lunch? Study? And so on. You'll be surprised at the interesting and meaningful suggestions people will discover simply by dreaming and brainstorming together. Here are a couple of examples: "How can we hallow our eating?" Eat with thankfulness, respect, generosity, and moderation. Eat with those beyond the faith, your neighbors, friends, the lonely, the poor, and so on. "How can we hallow our recreation?" Use the time and context to connect with people, to serve others, to be refreshed, to reflect on God, to connect with creation.

- Start to define holiness positively by what we actively do in hallowing the everyday, not by what we don't do. This viewpoint leads to a more life-affirming approach to holiness. This is exactly the holiness of Jesus—it seeks to change the world and sanctify it.

- Seek to integrate within the community the value that all of life is sacred and can/should be directed toward God. Talk about it regularly, and begin to live it out together. Seek to engage and redeem culture rather than avoiding it.

- Develop a theology that redeems pleasure and traces it back to God, its originator. This will become an important missional asset, as explained in The Redemption of Pleasure excerpt.

The Redemption of Pleasure Because of its innate dualism, Western Christianity has generally struggled to integrate pleasure, passion, and instinctive drives into the faith. There exists no framework to connect pleasure with God. You don’t have to search long to discover this distortion in relation to sex, food, and other forms of pleasure. It is our belief that the skewed ascetic perspective fueled by dualism has deeply alienated the average person from Christianity by failing to help them integrate their bodies and associated physical life into a spiritual experience of God. We cannot underestimate the damage that this life suppression has done to the way we are perceived by the average non-Christian, not to mention the fact that it represents a distortion of the biblical view of the world.

It also highlights the need to recover a redemptive framework for pleasure as a missional asset. We would do well to remember that people are motivated by their deepest pleasures, and if we can connect these to God, we will have established a vital bridge into the lives of those around us. Pleasure can be a greater motivator for God.10

> Practice Three: Redefine and Widen Your View of Worship

Directly connected to hallowing the everyday is the practice of redefining and widening our view of worship. Keeping in mind that there is no divide between the sacred and secular, a biblical expression of worship can and should occur in all spheres of life. It should not be reduced to a certain time and place, namely, a few hours a week inside a church building.

While there is inherently nothing wrong with gathering as a group of believers to express our adoration and love, if this is all that constitutes our worship, we’re probably in the thrall of dualism. In fact, this is one of the more influential practices that perpetuate dualism in our midst. Remember the diagrams above. All of life belongs to God, and true worship means bringing every sphere under him. So even though we might gather weekly for corporate worship, we must widen our view and practices.

- A good place to start is to ask the question, "What is worship?" Study the scriptures, explore what Jesus taught, read other perspectives, and together redefine and broaden your understanding and practice of worship.

- Encourage people in your group to share with one another the ways in which they are seeking to worship God outside of the regular corporate gatherings. This could become a great resource for your congregation.

- Alan's definition of worship is "offering our world back to God." This is an all-encompassing definition that incorporates all of life into worship—our time, money, resources, pleasures, voices, work, and the like, including our times of gathering together.

- To stir the imagination a little, we recommend reading and discussing chapters 12 and 13 in Michael Frost's book Exiles. Here, Michael outlines authentic worship as listed in a set of ways in which we love God.11 He suggests we love and worship God by:
  - loving others
  - obeying Jesus
  - lingering in God's company
- speaking about the things of God
- longing for the return of Christ
- forsaking other gods and idols
- laying down our life
- loving what God has created
- forgiving others

Now that’s what we mean by a wide and all-embracing, seamless approach to worship that seeks to orient all of life under the lordship of Christ.

Releasing the Glory of God One of the most wonderful metaphors in Jewish spirituality is the rabbinical teaching on the Shekinah (God’s glory). Some Jewish mysticism presents the Shekinah in a playful way, with the form of a woman and a personality. She is metaphorically portrayed as God’s wife in exile, that is, God and his glory have been tragically separated through the fall. The separation is one of a cosmic crash in which God’s glory was scattered into myriad sparks and caught up in all created matter. The holy sparks are now imprisoned in all things.

The remarkable aspect of this Jewish teaching is the view that it is our holy actions—that is, actions filled with holy intent and directed toward God—that actually free the holy sparks ensnared in all things and allow the exiled Shekinah to journey back to her Husband. God and his glory are joined together again when people act in holiness. Now, without taking the teaching as literal truth (most rabbis don’t), this is a helpful way of viewing the mission of God’s people in the world. When we act redemptively and in holiness, we fan into flames the creational purpose that lies at the heart of all things in God’s world—we liberate God’s glory that lies in it. And in so doing we bring God glory.12

> Habit 3: Make the Gospels the Primary Text

The third habit we suggest in keeping Jesus at the core of our collective consciousness and action is to make the Gospels our primary texts. In the same way that the remarkable movements clung to the gospel and linked their faith in utter simplicity to Christ, Jesus ought to be the prism through which we view our world. The Gospels, therefore, give us a primary orientation and function as principal texts for mission and discipleship. This is not to say we neglect the other sections of scripture, but rather that we read the entire counsel of God in reference to the Gospels. These are the narratives that shape and define us, essentially because they are the primary record of Jesus’s life and teaching.

Practice One: Recalibrate around Jesus’s Core Teaching In keeping Jesus at the heart and in making the Gospels our primary text, we should specifically home in on Jesus’s central teaching and seek to recalibrate all our learning and activity around these truths. This means we should not only spend a lot of time in the Gospels’ narratives, but particularly meditate upon the words and teachings of our Lord.

- As a community explore the parables Jesus told, and seek to

integrate these truths into everyday life.

- Explore what Jesus said about certain themes such as prayer or

money or heaven or hell.

- Study the Sermon on the Mount in depth. What do these truths

mean for us today?

Alan, in his book ReJesus (coauthored with Michael Frost),13 outlines a simple way in which to process the content and implications of Jesus’s core teaching. Thebook provides a table with three columns exploring the core aspects of Jesus’s teaching and life, the implications for discipleship and church, and ideas and examples of how this can be lived out. What follows is an excerpt from that table. This is not exhaustive but is an example of how a group can explore the central ideas and implications of Jesus’s teaching. It’s a great exercise in seeking to recalibrate around Jesus and his central teachings. You can use this same process in your own explorations.

> Practice Two: Cycle through the Gospels

An effective way to make the gospels the primary text for your community is to establish a practice where as many people as possible are reading the Gospels over and over again. This is what we mean by cycling through the gospels (we’re not telling you to get on your bike!).

- Set up a routine where everyone can read the same Gospel in the

same time period. This will help people to ask one another how they are doing in their reading and to discuss the content. Maybe you can assign a Gospel per month. This way each participant will read all four Gospels three times in the year. Encourage discussion, feedback, journaling, and prayer.

- Every time you meet as a small group, read through a section from

the Gospels.

- A church in Melbourne, Australia, hosts regular walks through the

city, stopping at the casino, parliament house, the business and banking center, skid row, and so on. At these places they read among themselves certain sections of the Gospel of Mark. This not only helps people become familiar with the gospel but sheds new light as they read and reflect right in the hustle and bustle of the city.

- Organize a Stations of the Cross reflection at Easter. This tradition,

which began with St. Francis of Assisi, helps people to meditate upon the chief scenes of Christ's sufferings and death, through an in-depth contemplation on the final hours (or Passion) of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels. This is a great way to help people enter into the biblical narrative in a profound manner.14 Practice Three: Keep the Gospels Central to Your Learning As we have seen, Deuteronomy 6:4 requires that our core beliefs and commitments are to become part of the fabric of our everyday lives. We are to impress them on our children, talk about them when we sit at home and walk along the road, when we lie down and when we get up. We are to have them as symbols on our hands (representing everything we do) and bind them on our foreheads (signifying everything we think). Not only that, but we are to write them on the door frames of our homes and on our gates. The bottom line is that the essence of our faith is to be integrated in the hub of life—through the daily activities and conversations between the members of the faith community. If the Gospels of Jesus are the core narratives that shape and define us, they must become central to our learning as a community, both formally and informally.

- Keep Jesus and the Gospels the focus of all your reading, teaching,

and exploration of scripture. Both Old and New Testaments point to Jesus as the focal point of God’s revelation and redemption.

Reducing the Bible to moral instruction, without Jesus and the Gospels as the central message, is to bypass the core purpose of scripture. There are great resources available, such as Graeme Goldsworthy’s According to God’s Plan,15 to help retain this focus.

- Each year explore one of the Gospels in reasonable depth. To

maximize the learning, you could coordinate your large-group and small-group gatherings to be studying the same Gospel at the same time. This will enable both largeand small-group processing as well as give more time for reflection.

- Invite a specialist on the Gospels (such as a New Testament

professor or seminary lecturer) to run a series of informative and practical workshops for your group. From there you could take the information presented and process it over time through your smallgroup structure.

- Host seminars on how to get the most out of reading the Gospels.

This could be as simple as providing basic principles in studying them, or by offering examples of reading all scripture in light of Jesus and the Gospels.

- Set up a system where every week a portion of the Gospels is emailed or text-messaged to each person in the group. If everyone is receiving and reading the same excerpt from the Gospels, it’s sure to flow into some of the everyday conversations.

## Third Place Communities

As mentioned in the preface, Third Place Communities (TPC) is the network of missional communities that Darryn cofounded. TPC will function as a test case throughout this book. Please keep in mind that we are not holding TPC up as a superior example; we are simply more familiar with them than with other communities.

They have also been working at integrating the forgotten ways theory into their practice, thus providing us with plenty of examples. In seeking to keep Jesus as the central focus in their mission, TPC have experimented with a number of practices and approaches. Here are a few examples:

- TPC encourage all members to cycle through the Gospels

each year.

- Together they have sought fresh perspectives on Jesus and

have explored a Hebraic view of faith. All new participants are encouraged to read related articles and books.

- All in the community are encouraged to read a few standard

texts on Christ and mission.

- TPC have compiled an extensive resource of DVD

presentations on the Gospels and other elements of Christology.

These are passed around, viewed together, and discussed.

- Periodically, a specialist has been invited to partake in

workshops and seminars.

- They have designed and printed hundreds of What Would Jesus Brew t-shirts. While this is a little tongue-in-cheek humor, it also functions as a reminder that Jesus is always active in brewing something in the world (if you want to see the design or grab your own shirt check out http://www. cafepress. com/wwjbapparel). They have also summarized their core practices into this question: “What is Jesus brewing within, amongst and around?” (more on this later).

> Group Processing Session 1: Explore (talk about it)

- If you had to highlight one idea from this section, what would it

be? Why?

- In your own words, explain the concept of “Jesus is Lord” to

another person in the group. What ideas excite you? Concern you?

- What are the best habits and practices to consider? We have

provided a few. Can you think of any others?

- What questions do you have?

- How can you imagine the group growing in this area?

> Session 2: Evaluate (reflect deeper)

- Is the practice of Jesus as Lord a strength or a weakness for your

group?

- Does the majority of the group understand and believe in this

concept?

- How is commitment to these ideas already demonstrated in your

group? Give examples.

- When was the community best at keeping Jesus as Lord? What

were the contributing factors?

- In your opinion, what are the most important issues in keeping Jesus as Lord?

- What challenges are ahead? What are the barriers? Where do you

anticipate resistance?

## Session 3: Employ (act on it)

- What needs to happen during the next twelve months? What do

you need to do that you’re not currently doing?

- What will you need to let go of?

- What information and resources will you need? Who else needs to

be involved?

- How will you know if you have grown in these areas? What will

the key indicators be?

- What habits and practices will you seek to integrate during the next

twelve months? List them here.

## Action Plans

What are the first steps you will take to achieve these goals? Looking at your past, are they realistic?

- 4.

## Session 4: Personal Journal

After processing much information, take some time to pray, listen, and respond to God. How is God prompting you and how will you respond? Take time to record your impressions as well as insights from the group. Write a prayer expressing your desires to God. If appropriate, share your thoughts in the group, and then pray together.

- What am I sensing from God?

- What is my prayer?
