# Missional-Incarnational Impulse

In this chapter we will look at the missional-incarnational impulse, which is in effect the practical outworking of the missionary God who sends the church outward into the world and deep into culture and context. It draws its inspiration from the incarnation and is energized by the mission of God. The purpose of combining these words is to link two practices that in essence form one and the same action, to seed and embed the gospel in different groups, cultures, and societies. This is a significant key to apostolic genius!

## Missional

We have come to see that mission is not merely an activity of the church. It is the result of God’s initiative, rooted in his desire to restore and heal creation. Mission means “sending” and is the central biblical theme describing God’s action in human history. This sending is embodied and lived out in the missional impulse. It is the outward movement rooted in God’s mission that compels the church to reach a lost world.

The Forgotten Ways describes the mission of God as a “sneeze-like” influence that releases the outward flow of the movement of God like seeds in the wind. It is contrasted with the attractional church, where the seeds are put in ecclesial storehouses, effectively extinguishing the purpose they were made for. It is suggested that the attractional model focuses on church growth, which hinders the power of multiplication and makes it impossible to release a movement.

## Incarnational

John 1:1–18 describes the incarnation of Jesus, when he took human form and moved into the neighborhood in an act of humble love the world had never known. The central thrust of the incarnation was that by becoming one of us, God was able to achieve redemption for the human race and radical identification with all that it means to be human.

If God’s way of reaching his world was to incarnate himself in Jesus Christ, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be incarnational.

We need to exercise a genuine identification with those we are trying to reach so that they may come to know God through Jesus. The following framework is an example of how Jesus relates to us through the incarnation and how we can relate incarnationally to others.

Presence—Jesus was God in the flesh. This is a God who moved into the neighborhood and lived with humanity. The idea of presence highlights the role of relationships and close connection in mission.

When we hang out as representatives of Jesus, people get the idea that God is interested in fostering a relationship with them.

Proximity—Not only was God in Jesus fully present to humanity, he interacted directly with people from every level of society. He ate with Pharisees as well as tax collectors and prostitutes. If we follow in his footsteps we need to be directly and actively involved in the lives of the people we are seeking to reach. This involves both spontaneity and regularity in our friendships with those beyond the church.

Powerlessness—If we truly desire to act like Christ, we cannot rely on conventional forms of power and leadership to communicate the gospel. We must practice Jesus’s model of servanthood and humility in our relationships with one another and the world.

Proclamation—The gospel Invitation initiated in the ministry of Jesus remains alive and active today. Agenuine incarnational approach requires that we are always ready to share the gospel story. We cannot take this aspect out of our mission and remain faithful to our calling.

> By living incarnationally we not only model the pattern of humility set up in
> the incarnation, but we also create space for mission to take place in organic

> essentially means taking the church to people rather than bringing people to

## The Combined Impulse

The missional-incarnational impulse is a two-in-one action operating together like scissor blades. The missional impulse relates to the outward movement of the church as a sent people, while the incarnational pulse refers to the embedding and deepening of the gospel. Together they result in both multiplication and transformation.

It is not hard to see that the reproductive capacities of church are directly linked to this impulse. The mission of God requires the seeding and reproduction of God’s people in every culture and group of people. Each unit of church can be conceived as a pod of seeds, each church pregnant with other churches. By insisting people come to us and seeking to control the mission environment, we lock up the power of multiplication. It seems that we suppress the “sneeze” by holding back the impulse to sneeze in the first place. To frustrate this impulse is to block the church’s innate reproductive capacity.

The missional-incarnational impulse requires that we embed the gospel and the gospel community in the fabric of the host community. We must develop churches that are both true to the gospel and relevant to the context it is seeking to evangelize—genuine Jesus communities that seek to become a functioning part of the existing culture while seeking to transform it.

## Putting First Things First

To become a missional church, we must realign our priorities and recalibrate our approach to ministry. Christology determines missiology, and missiology in turn determines ecclesiology. What is meant here is that the person and work of Jesus must directly inform our purpose and function—our mission in the world. And it is our mission that in turn must inform the structure and cultural forms of the church. To align ourselves correctly, we first need to return our attention to Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity, and recalibrate our approach from that point. Jesus is our constant reference point. When we go back to Jesus, we rediscover a whole new way of going about mission. From Jesus we learn to engage with people in an entirely fresh, “nonchurchy” way. He hung out with sinners and made the kingdom of God accessible and desirable to the average person.

## Church Follows Mission

The church is a dynamic expression of the people of God in any given place.

Worship style, social dynamics, and liturgical expressions must result from the process of contextualizing the gospel in any given context. When we begin with incarnational mission, the church will explore its way of life and corporate expression within each cultural context. Thus, the church will be formed out of mission and missional action specific to its context. This is what is meant by ecclesiology following mission. In our cities and neighborhoods there are literally hundreds of different cultural subgroups that can be reached by such means.

Now let’s explore a few examples of missional-incarnational practices used by churches around the world.

## Suggested Habits and Practices

If we wish to embrace the missionary genius of the remarkable Jesus movements, we will need to recover a genuine missional-incarnational impulse as the primary posture and movement of God's people. God continues to send the church outward into the world as well as deeper into people’s lives and contexts, to seed and embed the gospel. This out and down movement of the missional-incarnational impulse will provide the framework for us to explore its associated practices. Keep in mind that these two movements form one action and cannot exist without each other.

Churches would do well to shape their way of life around this impulse.

We will look at the missional-incarnational impulse as two basic habits, each consisting of a number of suggested practices.

1. Going out
2. Going deep

## Habit 1: Going Out

The “out” habit, and connected practices, is primarily focused on moving God’s people out into the hub of life. Afellow missionary suggested that to sustain this outward impulse, a missionary group must incorporate proximity, frequency, and spontaneity into their collective life.1 Let’s explore these characteristics and how they relate to missional-incarnational practices.

Practice One: Proximity This relates to the physical closeness Christians have with the people they are hoping to connect with. Jesus’s commission to “go throughout the world” clearly indicates that the responsibility rests with the church to initiate this nearness and live each day in close proximity with those beyond the faith.2 Proximity means that Christians need to be in direct proximity to the host community, rather than expecting the community to move toward them. Just as God through the incarnation moved into the neighborhood, the people of God should do likewise.

- Move into the neighborhood and live in close proximity to those

with whom you wish to connect. That might mean that some members within your group choose to move house to actualize this closeness.

- Discover where locals gather and connect, and locate the mission

group within these social hubs. It’s a good idea to become part of these local rhythms and, as a group, to regularly spend time in these places. Spend time in third places,3 such as local cafés, sports clubs, pubs. Through frequenting these establishments, you will also develop connections with the staff, owners, and other patrons.

Maybe you can meet your friends or work colleagues on a regular basis for a drink or meal. This is a great context in which to introduce people from different social groups, like your soccer friends to your church friends.

- Hold some of your planning meetings in third places. Meet with

your team and colleagues in local third places, rather tan in a meeting room. Many of TPC’s team meetings were held in their local pub. They found it was far more helpful planning and dreaming about their mission immersed within the actual mission context rather than removed from it. Try it. If it doesn’t work, you can always go back to a meeting room.

- Walk your dog regularly. When Alan lived in Melbourne,

Australia, he regularly took Ruby, his beloved boxer, for a walk throughout his local area and subsequently developed a number of relationships with other dog owners. They would stop and chat while their dogs played and sniffed one another. Just think—if you walked your dog a few times per week and regularly connected with the same people, over a year that’s a significant amount of time in conversation with other community members.

- Rather than reading your book or writing your paper in the

seclusion of your home or office, why not venture down to the local café, pub, or library and do it there? Who knows? You might connect with someone and find more inspiration for your task.

- Join a community or interest-based group. Many Christians we’ve

talked with tell us about the groups they’ve joined in the hope of connecting with others. Book clubs, Amnesty International, sporting groups, fitness classes, belly dancing, parents groups, and community garden co-ops are just some of the groups we’ve heard about. Check out what’s in your area; we bet there are heaps to choose from.

- Find a hobby. If you have one, great. If you don’t, find a hobby

and connect with others who share a similar passion.

## InnerCHANGE

As a mission order committed to sharing the good news among low socioeconomic communities, InnerCHANGE began when John Hayes realized that driving down to and moving into poor neighborhoods were two very different propositions. He said that for too long he had been driving in and out of people’s lives, so he found an apartment and moved into the neighborhood—Minnie Street, Santa Ana, Orange County, California, to be precise. After many years of mission on Minnie Street, John, with his wife, Deanna, and daughter Savannah, relocated to inner-city San Francisco, where they lived and worked among locals. From there, they moved to the UK, where they continue their mission in close proximity to inner-city Londoners. Acollective commitment all InnerCHANGE workers make is to spend 80 percent of their time in the local neighborhood—an impressive commitment to proximity!

## Upstream Communities

This missional band in Western Australia made this move when five families sold their homes and relocated to Brighton, a new suburban development one hour north of Perth. For these families, among other changes, it meant selling their homes, locating new homes, securing employment, and enrolling the children in new schools.

We find this a gutsy and smart way to enact proximity in mission.

## Hot Dogma

Agroup of missional Episcopalians in Pittsburgh decided to create this kind of proximity through the creation of a third place in the basement of their local cathedral. They developed a distinctive style of hot dog, arranged lounge chairs around the space, and scattered puzzles, games, and magazines on the tables. They serve great coffee and call the business Franktuary (originally, “Hot Dogma”). Their slogan we find wonderfully liturgical: “Franks be to God!”

## Practice Two: Frequency

Frequency pertains to the regularity of this connection. Proximity locates the Christian community among people, but frequency builds the familiarity needed for authentic relationships and community to develop. It’s one thing to identify with the locals; it’s quite another to be identified as the locals. Frequency is the key.

- Adopt a local watering hole or equivalent. It might be a pub or bar,

a café, the beach, or a certain park in your area. Obviously, it will be different for every context. Identify a local place in harmony with your group focus, and hang out there regularly. The key is to move from identifying with the locals to actually becoming one.

This is exactly what Jesus did through the incarnation.

- Shop at the same places. Historically, the marketplace was a hub

for meaningful connection. We need to recover the marketplace as a setting for connecting with others and building community. Try to purchase your food and household items at the same store every time. Whether that’s the local butcher, grocer, fishmonger, supermarket, or hardware store. Don’t chase the bargains but commit to supporting your local shopkeepers and producers.

You’ll develop familiarity not only with the staff and owners, but also with the other customers. Imagine if everyone in your mission group did this! Enjoy your shopping, and view it as a great opportunity for mission.

- Spend time at the school fence. Organize your day so that when

you pick up your children from school, you can spend a little more time chatting with the other parents. There’s always at least one parent or teacher ready to chat. Maybe you could invite them back to your home for a cup of coffee while your children play in the yard, or go for a walk to the local park together.

- In partnership with others in your mission group, invite people to

your home for dinner or barbeque. Or venture out for a picnic or Sunday lunch at a café. If you do this on a biweekly basis with a reasonably small group of people, you will be able to develop significant relationships over the course of the year.

- Go out for lunch or coffee with work colleagues once a week. It’s

amazing how different the conversation becomes outside the immediate work context.

## Third Place Communities

> TPC gathers every week at a neighborhood pub. Each

Sunday evening for the past six years, this group have met to share a drink, catch up with friends, and meet new people. Many TPC regulars have rented or bought homes within walking distance from the pub, making it simple to drop by regularly.

## Phil and Laina

Christian Associates missionaries Phil and Laina Graf live with their five children in the heart of Amsterdam.

To develop genuine connection with the locals, Phil and Laina frequently venture down to a local jazz club for a meal and to enjoy some of the finest live music. Through this regularity, they have become close friends with the club owner and local musicians, as well as many other patrons. Via these connections they have now been introduced to many others in the area. This is smart mission thinking and practice. They not only have identified where people are gathering but regularly locate themselves in the heart of this social activity.

## The Joshua Tree

The group Joshua Tree in Queensland, Australia, gathers most Sunday mornings for breakfast down at the local beach. They fire up the barbeque, cook their eggs and bacon, and spend the morning hours eating and talking.

After breakfast some go for a swim or surf, or simply chat as they relax on the grass next to the beach. Instead of inviting families to a church service, the JT members simply invite their friends to the beach for breakfast.

What a great way to spend Sunday morning, but more importantly, it’s a healthy way to develop familiarity with others.

## Practice Three: Spontaneity

While proximity locates Christians among people, and frequency develops the familiarity required for relationships, spontaneity provides the flexible environment needed to grow deeper connections. Genuine relationships develop informally through unplanned and impromptu connections. But, by definition, spontaneity doesn’t occur without making space for it. Missionary groups have to prepare for it by creating space in their life and mission. Churches desiring to engage people in mission will need to make sure they are not too busy to welcome the unexpected.

- I mplant deep within the mission group a flexibility and openness to

spontaneity. Expect that as a result of proximity and frequency, opportunities for spontaneity will arise. Clever mission groups anticipate spontaneity and realize it is crucial to be adaptable and responsive.

- Make room for people. This will mean evaluating how you

currently spend your time individually and as a group. In light of this, reorder your individual and collective life to include spontaneity with others. If we are honest, most of us will see are too busy for meaningful connection. We must slow our pace, as nothing can be loved at speed.

- Free up your weekends. Many in the West still enjoy their leisure

time on weekends, so make sure you keep enough spare time to socialize on Saturday and Sunday. For many people, Saturdays are taken up with catching up on sleep, sports, grocery shopping, cleaning the house, and the like. Sunday is increasingly the time when people, and in particular families, have their leisure time together. So free up your time to connect on weekends. By the way, guess where most Christians are on Sundays?

- Streamline the organization and administration requirements for

your group. Limit the time and energy needed to keep the machine running. If your mission group or church is an incorporated entity, there are obvious legal requirements and processes you need to adhere to, such as banking, reporting, and insurance. But keep it as minimal as possible.

- Simplify the way your church learns and gathers. Organize

communal gatherings and worship times in a way that minimizes the time and energy of church members. Arrange your church gatherings around the lifestyles and schedules of the host community. If the people you are connecting with are out and about socializing on a Sunday morning or afternoon, then hold your church meetings at another time, so you can spend time with them.

- Limit the frequency of your in-house gatherings. How often does a

congregation need to meet? Some mission groups we know have decided to meet three to four times per calendar month in order to release their time for missional engagement. These churches have remarked that as a result, they have experienced a higher percentage of attendance at their gatherings, and that fellowship has grown stronger as people have time to engage in mission together. If you want to foster fellowship and build community spirit, then engage in mission and service together. People will coalesce far more profoundly when they are involved in activity beyond themselves.

- Limit planning meetings. Establish how often you need to meet for

planning, and stick to it. If you want to spend more time together as a team for developing camaraderie, then engage in mission together. This will build far more solidarity that sitting around planning mission.

Spontaneity is about having the time to sit down for a coffee and chat with someone who visits unexpectedly, or feeling free to stop and talk with a person you’ve bumped into on the street. Or it can simply be inviting people to your house for dinner on the spur of the moment. On a broader level, it’s feeling free to abandon programs and strategies if they obstruct meaningful connection with others.

Embracing proximity, frequency, and spontaneity is nothing less than integrating mission into the natural rhythms of everyday life. Rather than seeing mission as a compartment or program, view it seamlessly as a way of life. We highly recommend that mission groups guide their individual and collective lives to connect with the lifestyles of those they wish to serve.

> Questions for Reflection on Proximity, Frequency, and Spontaneity

Here are a few questions each missionary group can ask and reflect upon periodically. This will help the group assess whether they are embracing the mission potential of proximity, frequency, and spontaneity.

Q. Are we in close proximity with those we feel called to? Give example of proximity.

Q. Are we spending regular time with these people? Give example of frequency.

Q. Are we too busy to develop meaningful relationships?

Give example of spontaneity.

Practice Four: Ask Missionary Questions In positioning a missional group in the appropriate places within the community, it is important to ask a series of missionary-type questions. We cannot highlight enough the value of this practice. Here are a few samples of the kind of questions that need to be asked.

- Where are people gathering and experiencing community?

- Where are people finding meaning and a sense of identity?

- What are the current existential issues? Where are people

expressing a longing for the divine?

- How does the gospel address these issues? What is “good news”

for these people?

- Where is God already at work in the community? And how can we

join with God?

- Given the above answers, what will church look like for this

community?

Once a group has reflected on these questions, it will be in a better position to ask the following question.

- Who is it that God has called us to? Who are the people with

whom we desire to build meaningful relationships? Is it the surfing culture, young families, senior citizens, people who socialize in third places, or those who reside in a particular geographical area?

In today’s climate of diversity and complexity, strategically minded mission groups will focus on a host culture and aim to weave their lives into the very fabric of that community.

Practice Five: Find People of Peace Authentic organic mission will mean being introduced to the host community through its existing members. Therefore, in the early stages it is essential to befriend local leaders and influencers as a natural Introduction to that community. Quoting Luke 10, Alan, in a previous book, referred to these people as “people of peace.”4 In that account, Jesus sent out seventy-two disciples ahead of him into every place he was planning to visit. Jesus instructed them to find a “person of peace” in each area, to stay in their homes, and to eat and drink with these hosts as an organic way into that community. We assume from the basis of that relationship that the host would then introduce his guests to his neighbors and other acquaintances, providing the connection for the disciples to introduce Jesus. People of peace are influential members of the community who have good reputations and are spiritually open. Locating these people and spending time developing meaningful connections will be a key step in the process of seeding and embedding the gospel in every new context.

## Habit 2: Going Deep

The “deepening” habit and its related practices is concerned with implanting the gospel in a local context through meaningful relationships. It seeks to move the Christian community deep into culture and life.5 Whereas the missional impulse requires time and is crucial, as it sends God’s people into the hub of life, it is only the beginning of a genuinely biblical form of mission. The incarnational impulse, with its attentiveness to context, must lead followers of Jesus deeper into the lives of the people they are seeking to reach. Whereas the goal of the missional impulse is to continually locate God’s people among the host community where they can lovingly share and incarnate the gospel, the incarnational impulse seeks to identify with the host community, reveal God’s character and presence, and redeem through embedding the gospel.

Practice One: Meaningful Engagement To implant the gospel in any given context, it is necessary to create an environment where the mission group enjoys ongoing meaningful engagement with its host community. We are surprised how daunted many Christians are at the prospect of this level of engagement with those outside the religious community. Sadly, we believe the Christian community has largely forgotten the importance and the art of building friendships with those beyond the church. I ronically, this is what Jesus was so good at! The missional community is called to bring meaning and spiritual reflection into everyday life, because that is precisely where people engage. To do this, we will have to remember and relearn how to engage meaningfully. Alitmus test for this is to periodically ask, “Are we a significant part of other people’s lives? Do these people think that we add meaning and value to their lives?”

- Allow the natural process of relationship development to take its

course. Genuine relationships require time and commitment. We cannot fast-track relationships. Allow for time and space.

- Engage in culture and view it as an asset, not a threat. Read books

that are not by Christian authors, both fiction and nonfiction.

Regularly read the newspaper or explore current affairs online. Go to the movies. And so on. How can we meaningfully connect with others if we are not engaging in the same world? It is impossible to wholly interpret culture from the outside. This is largely a prophetic role, so seek out the prophets in your midst and follow their lead.

- Rites of passage such as weddings, funerals, birthdays, birth

celebrations, and the like are profound contexts in which to build meaningful connection. Sadly, fewer people seek the church to conduct these ceremonies. This is missionary ground we need to recover. Sharing these deeply meaningful rites of passage with others is a profound missional experience. It’s a huge Invitation into their world. Giving meaning to life’s transitions is one of the roles the church should play best. In this way, missional groups could provide meaningful celebrations for those who ask, and serve as a type of chaplain to the host community. Often the process of planning together will provide just as much meaningful connection as the celebration itself. Keep in mind that in today’s climate, people welcome meaningful celebrations with open arms but, in general, are not interested in a particularly “religious” ceremony. It’s important that missionary groups are flexible and adaptive.

- Recover the art of conversation. Look to the Gospels, and notice

how Jesus interacts with people, the questions he asks, and the replies he gives. He was a master conversationalist. Mission communities would do well to learn how to conduct meaningful conversations by developing their listening and interpersonal skills.

If you’re privileged to have social workers in your community, ask them to enhance the group’s capacity to interact and converse through developing and learning new skills.

- Be intentional beyond the social moments. It’s very important that

we attend relationships outside of the general social times. It’s not enough to be a good conversationalist at a party or the pub. You must follow up with people to develop a meaningful relationship.

So make that phone call and invite them out for coffee, or invite them over for dinner, or send them that encouraging text message.

- Build relational networks. Rather than developing programs or

religious spaces, seek to create a network of significant friendships spread throughout the host community. Michael Frost has suggested that as we develop this system of relationships, more and more people from the community will be swept into this network. He likened this to the ancient process of fishing, where together people used nets, as opposed to a single person with a rod, hook, and line. He suggested that in the same way the first-century fishermen prepared their nets, we will need to spend significant time on building the network of friendships.6 It might be helpful at some point to map the relationships across the mission group to highlight common patterns and connections as a way to discern how to best arrange your time.

- Spend the majority of your time with just a few. Unfortunately, we

cannot befriend everyone within sight. Most of us have the capacity to build significant relationships with just a handful of people. This is a missionary discipline that many find harsh, but in the end it is actually more loving. Identify those people you feel led to spend more time with, and concentrate on these relationships as a priority.

- Share projects. In his book The Shaping of Things to Come, Alan

suggested shared projects as a simple but profound way to build meaningful connection with those beyond the church.7 Through working on useful endeavors shoulder to shoulder with those in the host community, significant conversation, shared values, and deep connection naturally develop. This is called camaraderie, and it will be explored in more depth in the communitas section. These projects might already exist within the community; or a mission group can easily start one and invite others to join. Here are a few ideas:

- Join a cooperative that aims to clean up local areas or polluted

waterways.

- Start or join a local art group that installs art within public

spaces.

- Organize an awareness and fundraising initiative for a local

nonprofit group or school.

- I nitiate a community garden to grow fruits, herbs, and

vegetables.

- Become a member of a local political group.

Practice Two: Proclamation Agenuine incarnational approach will require that missional groups are prepared to share the gospel story with those around them. While we recognize that the gospel message must always be embodied in the life of the church,8 it’s a responsibility and privilege for God’s people to share the story of Jesus with those around them.

It’s clear that the post-Christendom environment in which we live requires a new approach to evangelism. How this is embodied, we believe, is largely up to each group and particular context. The New Testament writers viewed evangelism as highly relational and casual, as they encouraged all believers to talk about Jesus through everyday interactions. Paul encourages us to make the most of every opportunity, to let our conversations be full of grace, seasoned with salt, in order to know how to answer everyone.9 Peter similarly recommends that we should always be prepared to give an answer to those who ask us to the give reason for the hope we have. But, he adds, we are to do this with gentleness and respect.10 Evangelism in this light will be more conversation, less presentation.

Alan has suggested the following framework for this kind of natural evangelism:11

- Excite curiosity through storytelling.

- Provoke a sense of wonder and awe.

- Be extraordinarily loving.

- Explore how God has touched their lives.

- Focus on Jesus.

In Psalm 139 David implies that before we were born we enjoyed a subconscious awareness of God—that he knew each of us within the womb.

Jewish mysticism likewise proposes that each person is born with an experience and memory of God. It suggests that as we enter the world through birth, we forget this connection but, paradoxically, the same process results in our ability to remember. Could it be that evangelism is a process of helping people remember and reconnect with their maker? Maybe it’s more helpful to view evangelism as uncovering the God who is already present in their lives. In this sense, evangelism would be focused on evoking the memory of God and would consist of probing, prodding, and asking insightful questions. The writer of Ecclesiastes similarly highlights that God has set eternity in each person’s heart and that everyone at some point will yearn for connection with their Creator.12 Our task as missionaries, modeled squarely on Jesus, is to discern this movement of God in people’s lives. We must revive the old Wesleyan doctrine of prevenient grace—the fact that God is deeply and profoundly at work in every person, calling them to himself through Jesus Christ.

- Begin with the assumption that God is not far from anyone.

- Ask questions like, “Have you had spiritual experiences?” or

“When have you felt close to God?”

- Build on what people know and have experienced.

- Explore the gospel stories together.

- Share your own story.

Practice Three: Holy Living While it is important that we proclaim the gospel through our words, it is equally important that we do so through our actions and lives. In a very real and tangible way, our lives are our messages and will either give integrity to what we say or undermine our words altogether. Jesus said, “let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.”13 Likewise, Peter encouraged us to live such good lives among the broader community that they may see our good deeds and glorify God.14 Paul echoed this sentiment when he wrote that our lives are to shine like stars in the universe.15 How we live is integral to seeding and embedding the gospel.

The hope is that as we live holy lives, people will be intrigued and inspired to seek God. The only hitch is that Christianity has a reputation for suppressing life and its pleasures rather than embracing them. What has constituted “holy living” has done exactly the opposite and driven people away from God. Amissional-incarnational response is to begin to redeem everyday life, its experiences and pleasures, as gifts from God that can in fact reveal qualities about the Creator. If we are to have any real impact in this era, we will need to give new expression to “holy living.” If you want an example, look no further than Jesus. He is the best reference point for holy living. The disciple Matthew highlighted that this holiness was of a different kind altogether when he quoted Jesus as saying, “The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and “sinners.’”16 This is surely the kind of holy living we need to mirror. Jesus’s love for life and people attracted many. He ate and drank and socialized with people regardless of their race, lifestyle, gender, or religion, and some in the religious community called him a drunkard for it. If we wish to communicate to those around us that God is gracious, hospitable, interesting, and celebrative, we had better embody these qualities collectively. You’ll be surprised how many people notice.

It’s straightforward and commonsense, but when life gets too busy we forget that holy living and proclamation fit together and should never exist apart.

Practice Four: Hospitality The practice of hospitality is much broader than simply “putting on a good spread” for Sunday lunch. Essentially, hospitality is an expression and experience of God’s character. It’s more about what people sense and how they feel when they’re in your midst. TPC in Hobart define their call to practice hospitality as creating an environment where people in their local community experience the character of God, feel a sense of belonging before believing, and can explore their spirituality with freedom.

- Shared meals. Simply eat regularly with those in your host

community and recover the shared meal as fundamental to missionary engagement. Eating and drinking together exposes people to God’s character enfleshed within community. It communicates that God is hospitable, welcoming, enriching, lavish, celebrative, indiscriminate, nourishing, interesting... the list goes on! The Gospels are filled with stories where Jesus is found at a table connecting over food and wine. As a group of missionaries longing to be shaped by the habits of Jesus, these stories are inspirational and defining. If we desire to re-enchant Westerners with Jesus, the meal table, along with other forms of celebrating, will play a central role as we follow Christ’s lead and create environments of belonging before believing. It is undoubtedly one of the best modes for mission for the West.

- Share your table regularly with the poor. This in itself is one of the

most profound ways to change the world and be changed ourselves. If every Christian family were to have a poor person over for a meal once a week, we would literally transform the world through eating.

- Recover the “art of partying.” Christians are not generally known

for hosting lively parties, and yet we are the ones who have profound reason to celebrate. If Jesus is anything to go by, he whipped up a little more of the good stuff at a wedding in Cana and turned a rather average party into a hoot! We should be the ones to host the best parties, where people really celebrate and enjoy life. There is something within the relaxed, celebrative vibe of a party, where there are food and drink and music, that people respond to and wish to engage at deeper levels.

Practice Five: Contextualizing Community The deepening impulse of the incarnational mode must eventually express itself in the formation of a fully contextualized Christian community.

By this we mean that over time a new faith community will emerge and begin to form its “way of life” in reference to its immediate context. This newly gathered community will need to cultivate an endemic spirituality that has meaningful resonance within its environment. They will also disciple new Christians within the same context, allowing them to follow Christ and remain in their own culture. Atruly incarnational mode will also allow the natural lifestyle patterns of the host community to shape the church's life and worship. Incarnational mission works to integrate the gospel into the people group without damaging the innate cultural framework that gives that community history, purpose, and meaning. The gospel, therefore, will change and fashion the community from within.

This raises the question, “How will new faith communities be sustained?” What practices, disciplines, and rhythms will be incorporated to ensure rigorous discipleship and sustainability? What will these new churches look like? How will they gather or corporately connect with God, serve the community? These are questions each missionary group will need to explore together with members from the host community.

- Build church around people in their context. Remember that

church flows out of mission and should be expressed within its cultural environment.

- Listen to the people. Minister as if you have a stethoscope pressed

up against their world. Develop an increased attentiveness to the issues related to the given culture, and avoid assuming you know what good news is to them or what the church should look like in their culture.

- Spend more time listening to, eating with, and playing with the

neighborhood you live in. Work toward not merely identifying with the locals; seek to become one.

- Critically examine the culture together with the locals. What values

within the culture promote the gospel, and what obstructs it? How can we use the godly values within this context to point to Jesus?

And how can we redeem the values and customs that lead away from Christ? Seek to redeem the existing culture and guide it to its destiny in God, rather than impose an alien model upon it. Carry the Bible in one hand and a cultural map in the other.

- Experiment with new symbols and rituals that give fresh

expression to the Christian experience. Explore the host community’s history and culture to find practices that will enrich the collective experience and expression. This exploration is best done together with new Christians.

> For a detailed exploration into contextualization we recommend reading

“The Contextualized Church,” chapter 5 in The Shaping of Things to Come.17 Practice Six: Send We have already noted that God continues to send the church outward into the world as well as deeper into culture. Mission groups would do well to imitate this process and continue to send small groups from within their community to seed and embed the gospel in new contexts. This will ensure the missional incarnational impulse is embedded deep within the missional community. In short, continue to move out and down.18 Remember, the reproductive capacities of the church are directly linked to this impulse, as each unit of church can be understood as a pod filled with seeds, or pregnant with other churches.

Here is an example of a process that Darryn provided for the mission group he works with. This map was shaped in the context of mission while the initial group was going through the very process. Often the question was asked, “What next?” which led to discovering the next step. This is what they came up with. Since then, it has been refined and used again and again as groups are sent into new contexts.

> Group Processing Session 1: Explore (talk about it)

- If you had to highlight one idea from this section, what would it

be? Why?

- In your own words, explain the Missional-incarnational impulse to

another person in the group. What ideas excite you? Concern you?

- What are the best habits and practices to consider? We have

provided a few. Can you think of any others?

- What questions do you have?

- How can you imagine the group growing in this area?

> Session 2: Evaluate (reflect deeper)

- Is the Missional-incarnational impulse a strength or a weakness for

your group?

- Does the majority of the group understand and believe in this

concept?

- How is commitment to these ideas already demonstrated in your

group? Give examples

- When was the missional-incarnational impulse most active in your

community? What were the contributing factors? What was happening at the time?

- In your opinion, what are the most important issues for embracing

a missional-incarnational impulse?

- What challenges are ahead? What are the barriers? Where do you

anticipate resistance?

## Session 3: Employ (act on it)

- What needs to happen during the next twelve months? What do

you need to do that you’re not currently doing?

- What will you need to let go of?

- What information and resources will you need? Who else needs to

be involved?

- How will you know if you have grown in these areas? What will

the key indicators be?

- What habits and practices will you seek to integrate during the next

twelve months? List them here.

## Action Plans

What are the first steps you will take to achieve these goals? Looking at your past, are they realistic?

## Session 4: Personal Journal

After processing much information, take some time to pray, listen, and respond to God. How is God prompting you, and how will you respond?

Take time to record your impressions as well as insights from the group.

Write a prayer expressing your desires to God. If appropriate, share your thoughts in the group, and then pray together.

- What am I sensing from God?

- What is my prayer?

Third places are social contexts beyond the home or workplace such as sporting groups, pubs, cafés, clubs, etc.

Michael Frost and Alan Hirsch, The Shaping of Things to Come (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2003), 64.

We applaud many new mission groups who have sought to engage the community in mission. Nevertheless, while some have done well in connecting, many have created reasonably complicated and time-consuming approaches. Our concern is that it’s tempting to spend too much time on the outward movement, leaving little time and energy for deepening relationships.
