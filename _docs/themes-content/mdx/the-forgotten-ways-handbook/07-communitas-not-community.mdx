# Communitas, Not Community

In December 2004 something both dreadful and remarkable happened—the Asian tsunami that killed about 250,000 people provoked what was undoubtedly one of the most amazing explosions of worldwide generosity and compassion in recent history. In and through the sheer horror of the tsunami, people found one another in a new and remarkable way. This is an example of communitas, and it is exactly this aspect of humanity that will be explored in this chapter. Communitas takes many forms, but whatever the form, it describes the type of comradeship that was and is experienced in the phenomenal Jesus movements, and so is an essential element of Apostolic Genius. Both the Early Christian movement and the church in China experienced one another in the context of a shared ordeal that bound them together in a much deeper form of community than we have become accustomed to. For our purposes here, we can define communitas as the type of community that develops in the context of danger, an ordeal, or an overwhelming task. It happens when, faced with such a challenge, the participants “find each other” in a new and deeper way. The social bonds are strengthened and restructured. Friends become comrades.

## Liminality and Communitas

To come to grips with the dynamics of movements that change the world, we have found Victor Turner’s ideas of liminality and communitas particularly useful.1 Turner was an anthropologist who studied various rites of passage among African people groups and came up with the term liminality to describe the transition process accompanying a fundamental change of state or social position. Situations of liminality in this context can be extreme, where the participant is cast out of the normal structures of life, is humbled, disoriented, and subjected to various rites of passage, which together constitute a test of whether the participant will be allowed back into society and to transition to the next level in the prevailing social structure.

Liminality therefore applies to that situation where people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society, a place that could involve significant danger and disorientation, but not necessarily so.

For example, in many tribes all across Africa, younger boys are kept under the care of the women until initiation age—around thirteen. At the appropriate time, the men sneak into the female compound of the village at night and “kidnap” the lads. The boys are blindfolded, roughed up, and herded out of the village and taken into the bush. They are then circumcised and left to fend for themselves in the wild for a period lasting up to six months. Once a month, the elders of the tribe go to meet them to help debrief and mentor them. But at first they have to find both inner and outer resources to cope with the ordeal pretty much by themselves. During this time, the initiates move from being disoriented and individualistic to developing a bond of comradeship forged in the testing conditions of liminality. This sense of comradeship and communality that comes out of the shared ordeal Turner calls communitas. Communitas in his view happens in situations where individuals are driven to find one another through a common experience of ordeal, humbling, transition, and marginalization. It involves intense feelings of social togetherness and belonging brought about by having to rely on one another in order to survive. If the boys emerge from these experiences, they are reintroduced to the tribe as men. They are thus accorded the full status of manhood—they are no longer considered boys.

So the related ideas of liminality and communitas describe the dynamics of the Christian community inspired to overcome their instincts to “huddle and cuddle” and instead form themselves around a common mission that calls them to a dangerous journey. Communitas is always linked with the experience of liminality. It involves adventure and movement and describes that unique experience of togetherness that only really happens among a group of people inspired by the vision of a better world who attempt to do something about it.

Significant manifestations of Apostolic Genius teach us that liminality and communitas are the normative situation of the pilgrim people of God.

This is certainly the case for the phenomenal Jesus movements in view. It is in their shared ordeal that these movements thrive. In this perspective, the phenomenal Jesus movements were/are expressions of communitas, and not community as we normally conceive it.

## The Bible and Communitas

The claim that communitas and liminality are normative for God’s people is thoroughly biblical. Take Abram, for instance, who with his entire extended family is called by God to leave house and home to undertake a very risky journey to an unknown land. And when we look at the experiences they have along the way, the stories that have shaped all subsequent faith, we see that they are not safe little bedtime stories. Rather they call us to a dangerous form of faithfulness that echoes the faithfulness of Abraham (Gal. 3:15ff.; Heb. 11:9–13). Or when we explore the profoundly liminal exodus experience, we find that this very tricky journey permanently shaped the people of God and continues to do so to this day. The same can be said of the exile into Babylon centuries later. When we consider the lives and ministries of Samuel, Elijah, Samson, and David and his band, and we ask what conditions they encountered, we come up with the consistent themes of liminality and communitas.

When we come to the New Testament, we need only to look to the life of Jesus. He had nowhere to lay his head, and he discipled his followers on the road in the dangerous conditions of an occupied land, against a hostile Corinthians. Thebook of Acts is so filled with communitas and liminality that it reads like a rollicking adventure story. It seems that liminality and communitas are normative for the people of God in the Bible and in the Jesus movements of history. How did we ever lose this perspective?

It’s Everywhere!

It’s hard not to spot this type of communal experience in so many aspects of our lives. Already mentioned are those times of disaster, but communitas can be found in far more common situations like athletic teams, adventure camps, and short-term missions. Communitas also features in just about every movie, but particularly in adventure movies of various sorts. Consider the mythic truth in The Lord of the Rings. This great story highlights the fact that the “Fellowship of the Ring” actually becomes a real fellowship only as it undergoes great struggle and hardship in the face of overwhelming evil. By undertaking this seemingly impossible task, and by facing hardships together, the group actually becomes a communitas. They discover one another in a way they could not in any other circumstance. Here is the mythic representation of mission—nothing less than the destruction of evil in the world; discipleship—constantly choosing goodness in the face of overwhelming opposition; and communitas—becoming a great community together in pursuit of a mission. These stories have power over us because they awaken something deep inside us—the abiding human need for adventure, journey, and comradeship.

> Artificial Environments and the Death of Communitas

The loss of communitas also has massive implications for churches and other types of organizations. Without any real engagement with the “outside world,” churches quickly become sheltered, artificial environments that are safeguarded from the danger and disturbances in the surrounding environment. They become missionally unresponsive. They become closed systems with their own peculiar cultures that have little relational, social, and cultural associations to the world outside. The problem is that when a system is closed and artificial, and has generally not cultivated adaptability and internal variety, it will ultimately deteriorate toward equilibrium. And in living systems, total equilibrium means death. Contrary to what we might feel, danger and risk can be good, even necessary, for us.

> The Future and the Shaping of Things to Come

Cultivating a vigorous transformative vision can also create liminality and communitas. Holding a definite sense of vision and mission informs and alters how people think and behave in the present. When we are caught up in a vision and pursue it, we are changed, and we go on to enact history. This is exactly what is meant by the phrase “managing from the future.” This way of approaching organizational development means establishing a compelling goal that draws the organization out of its comfort zone. This concept of planning from the future is a key activator of mission and therefore a direct function of missional leadership. In many ways, this is how the kingdom of God works. It is God’s future pressing itself in on us. It not only creates liminality, but should result in communitas.

Mission as Organizing Principle Another liminal factor is to organize the church’s life around mission (our role outside of the church), not ministry (our relationships with one another).

Pastor Gordon Cosby2 noted that in over sixty years of ministry, he had observed that no groups that came together around a nonmissional purpose ever ended up becoming missional. It was only those groups that set out to be missional that actually got around to doing it. If evangelizing and discipling the nations lies at the heart of the church’s purpose in the world, then it is mission, and not ministry, that is the true organizing principle of the church. By planting the flag outside the walls and boundaries of the church, so to speak, the church discovers itself by rallying to it. If the church organizes around mission, then ministry naturally follows, because ministry is the means by which we accomplish mission.

As observed earlier, in chapter 2, dualism is the belief that the world is separated into spiritual and nonspiritual realms. The issue of dualism is raised again here because, although Christians largely reject this philosophy, we still tend to embody this belief in our structures and activities. In a diagram that reworks a previous version, we can illustrate what this might look like.

There is another way to configure these three elements that is much more integrated and biblical. This will simply involve reconfiguring the relation of God, world, and church. When we can conceive the three circles intersecting at the center, there we have a church that is truly missional, is deeply incarnational, and is acting in a way that extends the ministry of Jesus into the world. The fact is that God is everywhere. He is already deeply involved in all people’s lives. The church needs to adjust its position in relation to God and the world, and in doing so we must break the bondage of dualism.

## Suggested Habits and Practices

Communitas is an essential element of Apostolic Genius, as it describes the kind of deep comradeship that is experienced in phenomenal Jesus movements. If we wish to fashion the same level of togetherness and solidarity, we will need to embark on a mission that follows Jesus beyond our comfort zone into every nook and cranny of society. There, and only there, will we encounter true communitas. As a way to “hit the road” again, we suggest exploring the following four habits and related practices.

1. Develop a transformative vision
2. Position the church within the hub of life
3. Engage in shared endeavors
4. Put adventure back into the venture

Habit 1: Develop a Transformative Vision The first habit we suggest in fostering communitas is to develop a transformative vision. Calling people to a clear and compelling future can influence how they behave in the present and lead the group into genuine expressions of communitas. Developing a transformative goal that draws the organization out of its comfort zone is a key habit in creating camaraderie.

Here are a few suggestions in beginning to do that.

Practice One: Create a Daring Vision Agreat way to foster camaraderie is to gather the community around a collective vision that propels them out of their context and into their preferred future. The important word here is collective—for people to own it, they must be part of shaping it and be captivated by it. It must gather the dreams of individuals and integrate them meaningfully into a common dream.

- Dream and collaborate. It’s important to do this as a community.

We have already explored this in some depth in the section on organic systems, so if you’d like more suggestions, we refer you to that section.

- Once the daring vision is developed, talk about it a lot, and

together find simple ways to begin to act it out.

- Manage from the future. Establish a broad missional vision and

rally the community around it. This is what is meant by managing from the future—define the goal and move toward it.

Practice Two: Learn about Communitas Together Secondly, the process of exploring images and ideas relating to communitas is another key building block in fostering a compelling vision and common purpose. The key word is together. The process is just as valuable as the information, as it will nurture a sense of cohesion and shared purpose.

- Provide biblical examples of communitas. You will find them

throughout the scriptures, from Genesis to Revelation.

- Watch movies together, and then reflect. These stories have

influence because they awaken our need for adventure, journey, and comradeship. For suggested movies, see the resource section.

- As a community, work your way through books and articles that

relate to communitas. Read, dream, and discuss. A good place to start is to read chapter 5 in Exiles by Michael Frost.3

- Give people a taste of communitas. There’s nothing like being able

point to personal experience. In reflecting on people’s experience, uncover the importance and necessity of communitas in advancing the mission of Jesus. This will move theory into reality.

- Organize a short-term mission trip. This could be overseas or local.

In reflecting on the group’s experience of communitas, ask how this can become the normative experience for God’s people.

> Habit 2: Position the Church within the Hub of Life

Our tendency as the people of God is to separate ourselves from the world and create sacred places to fellowship, worship, and engage with God. As we have seen, this sacred–secular dualism has plagued the church, and while we reject this philosophy, we still tend to practice it in our structures, activity, and positioning. The outcome is that we create artificial environments that lead us away from real life and far from communitas. Anondualistic approach seeks interplay among God, the world, and the church. In the terminology of this book, this will mean to become missional-incarnational, which in turn will engender authentic communitas.

Practice One: Build Church around People, Not People around Church By positioning the church in the hub of life, we mean building church and all its components in the context of life, as opposed to removed from it.

Now, we don’t mean running a church service in a pub on a Sunday morning when none of the regular patrons are present. We’re referring to something a lot more integrated and contextual than that. And this applies not just to the church service, but to the entire life of the church—its fellowship, learning, worship, evangelism, care for the poor, pursuit of justice, stewardship, and so on. Building church around people seriously considers the host community when arranging each and every aspect of its life—its structure, activity, and positioning.

- Avoid artificial, religious environments. They are detrimental to a

vigorous spiritual life.

- Think creatively and brainstorm how you can rearrange your

church in the context of the broader community in which you are located.

- Evaluate your structures and activities. Do they inhibit or promote

connection with the broader community? Do they remove the church from real life or locate the group within the hub of life? Are your gatherings accessible and understandable?

- Identify your worship elements, and ask where else in society they

occurs. This will help in seeking a nondualistic experience that directly relates to your host community.

Practice Two: Keep the Missional-Incarnational Approach in Mind While we have explored this theme at length in its own chapter, it’s important to highlight this movement as central in creating genuine communitas through locating the church in the midst of life. To experience the kind of solidarity common to the early church, today’s church will need to activate this impulse as its primary posture.

- Reread chapter 4 to become familiar with the ideas and examples.
- As a group, create your own ideas that are best suited to your

group and context.

- Seek to integrate proximity, frequency, and spontaneity into the

life of the church.

Green Spaces In San Francisco a group called ReImagine refers to different colored spaces. Yellow space refers to a Christian spirituality that is concerned only with the personal, Interior world of faith. It characterizes the classic individualized form of faith that focuses on personal quiet times, Bible study, church attendance, and personal ethical behavior. Blue space refers to an exclusively other-focused form of Christian spirituality, one that takes context seriously and features such activities as social concern, justice seeking, activism, and public ethical behavior. It is only in the interaction between them that we come close to biblical missional activity and spirituality, as shown in the diagram below.

Since the combination of yellow and blue on the color chart does make green, it’s a clever way to think about missional spaces. In a Green Space, story and context, the individual and the communal, the Interior world and the exterior world, the religious and the nonreligious, find genuine meeting.4 Habit 3: Engage in Shared Endeavors The next habit we suggest in experiencing communitas is to get involved in shared endeavors with those in your immediate community. By this we mean taking part in projects that situate you shoulder-to-shoulder in meaningful endeavor with others in your church as well as with people in the broader, non-Christian community. This includes working side-by-side with the host community on meaningful initiatives, but it also involves engaging together in mission with other Christians. Yes, this means that you can experience communitas with people in the church as well as with those beyond the church. Obviously, the experience will be different in each case, but both are highly important and missional. The unique experience of communitas occurs when a group of people inspired by the vision of a better world actually attempts to do something about it together.

Practice One: Joint Community Projects Joint community projects are about engaging as a faith community in initiatives shoulder-to-shoulder with members from the local (host) community. Earlier in this book,5 we briefly looked at the idea of shared projects as a way to build meaningful connection with those beyond the church. Joint community projects are the same—they are highly missional and a great way to build communitas. In working together on communitywide projects, significant connection and camaraderie naturally develop.

Here are a few of our suggestions; however, it’s best that you create your own ideas related to your context.

- Care for the environment together. There are bound to be

numerous projects in your area to get involved with. If not, then create one, but do it in conjunction with members of the local community.

- Organize or support community fundraisers or awareness raisers

for local nonprofit groups.

- Volunteer a day a month for a local nonprofit group.

- Pursue justice together. There are always local and global issues in

need of volunteers and support.

- Organize an overseas trip to a developing nation to serve others in

need. Be mindful that the project is not too religious, where members are asked to run Sunday school for the local children.

Make it far more practical, so those beyond the church will feel like they can contribute meaningfully.

A Local Business Takes Initiative

Afriend who owns and operates a small physiotherapy business has adopted an overseas development project that as a company they support financially. What’s impressive is that they not only support the venture with their money, but also give their staff time off from regular duties to travel overseas to visit and serve this project. Imagine if every Christian business owner did that with their non-Christian staff! What a great way to build meaningful engagement and communitas with employees and coworkers.

## Murals in San Francisco

Mark Scandrette is an amazing urban missionary in bohemian San Francisco. One of the projects he’s helped initiate is a mural art co-op that gathers to paint walls throughout the city. The co-op secures the project, then gathers to decide what they want to communicate through the mural. After much discussion about politics, religion, meaning, and the like, they decide on a theme.

They divvy up the mural, so each member receives a section. It’s their task to design that part of the mural to make it fit in with the general theme and the work of the other members. Having done the conceptual design, they gather every Saturday, armed with stepladders and materials, and spend the whole day painting and chatting, as well as sharing lunch and maybe a few beers at the end of the day. The project can take up to three months to complete, and by the end of it, they have delved deep into each other’s lives and explored many themes related to life, God, and spirituality. Most of all, they have become good friends.6 Practice Two: Engage in Mission Together While joint community projects locate you side-by-side members of the host community, this practice is specifically about engaging in mission and evangelism together with other Christians. Through the experience of shared mission, a faith community will instill a “me for the community and the community for the world” ethos. As a result, camaraderie will form around a common sense of missional purpose. It’s helpful to encourage rhythms in which people can engage in mission together on a regular basis. Here are a few examples:

- Join a local sporting group together with a few members from your

church.

- Organize a book club, go for a regular bike ride with others, or

hang out weekly at the same social venue.

- Since 2002, Third Place Communities have practiced the regular

rhythm of going to the same pub every Sunday afternoon. This has been a great opportunity for engaging the broader community with the gospel.

- Every Tuesday night, a friend of ours goes out with a guy from his

church. Together, they invite a mutual friend or someone from work who is not a Christian. This has become a practice for them.

- Another group of Christians we know get together every week to

share a meal and watch a popular TV series with some of their friends from work.

Whatever you choose, remember that the point is to engage in mission together with others from your church. It’s not hard, but it does require shared commitment. Try it for a while, and after a few months reflect on your experience. You’ll be surprised at how effective this simple practice can be.

> Habit 4: Put Adventure Back into the Venture

Communitas involves adventure, risk, and experimentation. To experience it, churches must overcome their desire to “huddle and cuddle” and instead form around a common mission that calls them out of their burrow and into a risky adventure. This is exactly the leap of faith the twelve disciples made when they hitched their wagon to Jesus’s star. And it’s exactly the leap of faith groups of disciples need to make today. “Communitas isn’t a warm relaxing space where you can come and go as you please. Communitas requires commitment, integrity, hard work and courage.”7 Practice One: Take Risks Churches can tend to be risk-averse, and yet without risk, it is highly unlikely that there will be any missional movement at all. And contrary to what we might feel at times, risk and adventure are actually good for the soul. When we encounter adventure together and have to find the inner resources to manage it, a deep form of togetherness and love is found. In such situations relationships develop into comradeship, and people encounter God in a new way.

- Keep in touch with the adaptive challenges we all face. How do we

engage, communicate the gospel, and form church in a highly consumerist, post-Christian, postmodern context? Now, there’s a challenge for risky endeavor. This may in fact be God’s Invitation to the church to rediscover itself as a missional communitas.8 Brainstorm and dream of ways in which you can begin to address this challenge. Work the ideas into realistic and actionable steps.

- Use the stories in the Gospels and Acts to encourage experiences

of adventure and risk.

- We are aware of a number of programs where people enroll for an

overseas mission trip and then for the year following meet regularly for a meal where they reflect, pray, and encourage one another to take these experiences into everyday life.

Practice Two: Experiment History proves that Christianity advanced because in every era there were groups of disciples who were brave enough to experiment and risk failure and ridicule. These groups formed a deep sense of camaraderie that other Christians could only dream about. While we have explored experimentation as an essential practice for pioneering and multiplying,9 it’s also a significant way to foster communitas.

- Create conditions in which change, adaptation, and

experimentation will take place.

- Agitate the group by issuing a challenge. For example, you could

ask, “If we could do it all again, would we do it the same way?” If the answer is no, then you can ask, “How, then, should we do it?”

- Challenge the church to start thinking about how to engage an

unreached group within your community. I ssuing a challenge such as this will help the church learn to experiment and become more responsive to its context.

- Promote experimentation as an important task within mission.

Continually experiment with new modes of church and mission.

Philosophy Pubs There is a popular movement across the world for gathering together in third places and having good discussions on philosophy. They are known as philosophy cafés or pubs. Both Alan and Darryn have engaged in such forums and have found them exciting and fruitful contexts for mission.

> Group Processing Session 1: Explore (talk about it)

- If you had to highlight one idea from this section, what would it

be? Why?

- In your own words, explain the idea of communitas to another

person in the group. What ideas excite you? Concern you?

- What are the best habits and practices to consider? We have

provided a few. Can you think of any others?

- What questions do you have?

- How can you imagine the group growing in this area?

> Session 2: Evaluate (reflect deeper)

- Is communitas a strength or a weakness for your group?

- Does the majority of the group understand and believe in this

concept?

- How is commitment to these ideas already demonstrated in your

group? Give examples

- When did the community best experience communitas? What were

the contributing factors? What was happening at the time?

- In your opinion, what are the most important issues for creating

communitas?

- What challenges are ahead? What are the barriers? Where do you

anticipate resistance?

## Session 3: Employ (act on it)

- What needs to happen during the next twelve months? What do

you need to do that you’re not currently doing?

- What will you need to let go of?

- What information and resources will you need? Who else needs to

be involved?

- How will you know if you have grown in these areas? What will

the key indicators be?

- What habits and practices will you seek to integrate during the next

twelve months? List them here.

## Action Plans
