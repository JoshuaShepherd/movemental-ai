# Glossary of Key Terms

In order to assist the reader with some of the more technical words and phrases, this glossary has been adopted from The Forgotten Ways.

Essentially, it is a set of definitions that are key to understanding the book.

## Adaptive challenge

Aconcept deriving from chaos theory. Adaptive challenges are situations where a living system faces the challenge to find a new reality. Adaptive challenges come from two possible sources: a situation of (1) significant threat or (2) compelling opportunity. The threat poses an “adapt or die” scenario on the organism or organization. The compelling opportunity might simply come as “the food is better in the next valley... let’s move!” type scenario. Adaptive challenges set the context for innovation and adaptation.

Adaptive leadership An adaptive leader is the type of leader who develops learning organizations and manages to help the organization transition into different forms or expression where agility, responsiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship are needed. Adaptive leaders are needed in times of significant threat or considerable new opportunity, or both. This has direct relevance to our situation at the dawn of the twenty-first century.

Compare to operational leadership below.

APEST The term I use to describe the fivefold ministry formula in Ephesians 4.

APEST is an acronym for Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor, Teacher.

This has been adapted to APEST for the profiling mechanism found on www. theforgottenways. org/apest.

Apostolic I use the term very specifically to describe not so much the theology of the church but the mode of the New Testament church—to describe something of its energy, impulse, and genius as well as its leadership structures.

Apostolic Genius Apostolic Genius is the phrase I developed to try to conceive and articulate that unique energy and force that imbues phenomenal Jesus movements in history. My own conclusions are that Apostolic Genius is made up of six components (perhaps more, never less). Five are what I call mDNA and the other has to do with its spirituality and theology.

For the most part, I focus on the five elements of mDNA when I use the term. The five elements are missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, disciple-making, organic systems, and communitas.

Loaded into the term Apostolic Genius is the full combination of all the elements of mDNA that together form a constellation, as it were, each shedding light on the others. I also believe it is latent, or embedded, into the very nature of God’s gospel people. I suggest that when all the elements of mDNA are present and are in dynamic relationship with the other elements, and an adaptive challenge acts as a catalyst, then Apostolic Genius is activated.

Attractional church Essentially, attractional church operates from the assumption that to bring people to Jesus we need to first bring them to church. It also describes the type or mode of engagement that was birthed during the Christendom period of history, when the church was perceived as being a central institution of society and therefore expected people to “come and hear the gospel” rather than taking a “go-to-them” type of mentality. Not to be confused with being culturally attractive.

Biblical Hebraic Describes the worldview that basically formed, framed, and sustains the biblical revelation. Refers to the Hebraic worldview specifically found in the scriptures. Hebraic on its own can encompass the insights of later Judaism as well.

Chaos and chaos theory Chaos theory is a new scientific discipline that seeks to explore the nature of living systems and how they respond to their environment.

Thus, it applies not only to organisms but also to human organizations, which are considered living systems that operate in a very similar way to organic life. In the light of living systems, chaos is not necessarily a negative thing but can be the context for significant innovation.

However, it does pose a threat to living systems that fail to respond appropriately to the conditions of chaos. See chapters 3 and 7 for explorations into these ideas.

Christendom Describes the standardized form and expression of the church and mission formed in the post-Constantine period (312 AD to present). It is important to note that was not the original form in which the church expressed itself. The Christendom church is fundamentally different from the NT church, which is made up of a network of grassroots missional communities organized as a movement. Christendom is marked by the following characteristics:

1. Its mode of engagement is attractional as opposed to

missional/sending. It assumes a certain centrality of the church in relation to its surrounding culture. (The missional church is a “going/sending one” and operates in the incarnational mode)

2. Ashift of focus to dedicated, sacred buildings/places of worship. The

association of buildings with church fundamentally altered the way the church perceived itself. It became more static and institutional in form. (The early church had no recognized dedicated buildings other than houses, shops etc.)

3. The emergence of an institutionally recognized, professional clergy

class acting primarily in a pastor-teacher mode. (In the NT church people were commissioned into leadership in by local churches or by an apostolic leader. But this was basically different from a denominational or institutional ordination we know in Christendom.

This had the effect of breaking up the people of God into the professional Christian and the lay Christian. The idea of a separated clergy, I maintain, is alien to an NT church, as it is in the Jesus movements of the early church and China.)

4. The paradigm is also characterized by the institutionalization of grace

in the form of sacraments administered by an institutionally authorized priesthood. (The NT church’s form of communion was an actual [daily?] meal dedicated to Jesus in the context of everyday life and the home.) Christocentric Simply that Christ is center. If something is Christocentric, then its organizing principle is the person and work of Christ.

## Christology/Christological

Essentially Christology comprises the biblical teaching of and about Jesus the Messiah. For instance, when I say Christology must inform all aspects of the church’s life and work, it means that Jesus must be first and foremost in our life and self-definition as church and disciple. The adjectival form simply means that the element being described must be referenced primarily by our understanding and experience of Jesus the Messiah.

Church Planting The initiation and development of new, organic, missionalincarnational, communities of faith in multiple contexts. We affirm that all true mission aims at the development of communities of faith. Thus church planting is an essential part of any authentic missional strategy.

Communitas Adopted from the work of anthropologist Victor Turner, who used the term to describe the experiences that were part of initiation ceremonies of young African boys (see liminality.) The related ideas of liminality and communitas, one of the key elements of mDNA, describe the dynamics of the Christian community inspired to overcome their instincts to “huddle and cuddle,” and to instead form themselves around a common mission that calls them onto a dangerous journey to unknown places, a mission that calls the church to shake off its collective securities and to plunge into the world of action. There they will experience disorientation and marginalization but also encounter God and one another in a new way. Communitas is therefore always linked with the experience of liminality. It involves adventure and movement, and it describes that unique experience of togetherness that really happens only among a group of people inspired by the vision of a better world actually attempting to do something about it.

Complexity Complexity is related to a situation of chaos. In essence living systems theory maintains that living organisms tend to organize themselves in greater degrees of complexity. Complexity also acknowledges that when we are dealing with living systems, they are indeed complex.

Because of complexity, relatively small actions can have significant consequences in the system.

## Constantinianism

This is another word for Christendom, because Christendom was basically initiated by Constantine’s actions in bringing the church into official relationship with the state. Constantinianism is the type of all modes of church that resulted from the merger between church and state and has dominated our mind-sets for the last seventeen centuries.

## Cultural Distance

Aconcept that helps us try and assess just how far a people group is from a meaningful engagement with the gospel. To do this we have to view this as something of a continuum that looks like this....

Each numeral with the prefix m indicates one significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of the gospel. An obvious example of such a barrier would be language. If you have to reach across a language barrier, you have a problem. But others could be race, history, religion/worldview, culture, etc. For instance, in Islamic contexts, the gospel has struggled to make any significant inroads because religion, race, and history make a meaningful engagement with the gospel very difficult indeed. Because of the Crusades, the Christendom church really damaged the capacity for Muslim people to apprehend Christ, and Semitic peoples have long memories. So we might put mission to Islamic people in an m3 to m4 situation (religion, history, language, race, and culture). The same is true for the Jewish people in the West. It is very hard to “speak meaningfully” in either of these situations.

Dualism (Particularly Platonic Dualism) The view that spirit is good and that anything that resists spirit is necessarily bad. Matter resists spirit and is therefore evil. The form that really impacted the church came from Plato. Plato believed that the real world was in fact the world of eternal ideas and essences located in an invisible spiritual reality, and that the world of matter and things is but its shadow and therefore has no essential reality. Ashadow is only a reflection of the real and not the real itself. The real was to be found in its essence of an object, in the Idea of it, and not in the way it appears to us in our world. This has also been called dualism, and by the fifth century AD it had become the predominant worldview in the Western church. Dualism thus naturally leans toward essence over function. The reality of a thing abides in its idea or essence and not in its appearance nor in what it does. The net effect of this doctrine was to divide the world between the sacred or the essential, and secular or the functional/physical. This has massive ramifications for the way we do church and structure our spirituality.

Early Church The period of the history of the church spanning the New Testament church as well as that up to the time of Constantine in 312 AD. The way I use the term implies a certain type or mode of the church: that of a radical, grassroots network of churches and people, organized as a movement, largely in the context of persecution.

## Ecclesia

The predominant biblical word translated as “church” in English. The way I use it in this book will highlight something of the pristine idea of the church is God intended it.

Ecclesiology Classically, this refers to the biblical teaching about the church.

## Emergence

“The principle of emergence was developed to explain the ways organisms develop and adapt in differing environments. Contrary to popular notions that they develop through some top-down, predetermined, well planned strategy, emergence theory shows that complex systems develop from the bottom up. Relatively simple clusters of cells, or groups of individuals, who individually don’t know how to address a complex challenge, when they come together will form, out of relatively simple interactions, an organizational culture of a higher complexity that can address these challenges. In other words, the answers to the challenges faced by organisms and organizations in changing environments tend to emerge from the bottom up rather than get planned beforehand from the top down. This is why we describe missional leadership as the cultivation of environments within which the missional imagination of the people of God might emerge.”1 Emerging Missional Church (EMC). A. Roxburgh and F. Romanuk, “Christendom Thinking,” 28.

> Essentially I developed the term to identify and describe the new form
> of ecclesia forming in our day. In the way that it is used in this book, it
> will be viewed as an emergent structure, a new form of ecclesia in our
> combination of these two factors that has created a new form of church.

I also use it to describe the phenomenal movement that is going on in our day. This is not to deny the continuity of the EMC with the people of God in all ages, but to distinguish it in form alone.

## Evangelistic-attractional

This describes the missional impulse of the Christendom church and that of the church growth movement. Essentially, it involves the assumption that all outreach and evangelism must bring people back to church in order to facilitate the numerical growth of that church.

Another way to say it is “outreach and in-drag.” The way I use it is to pose it as the opposite of the missional-incarnational impulse.

Environments/Fields The universe in which we live is filled with unseen fields. Though invisible, fields nonetheless assert a definite influence on objects within their orbit. There are gravitational fields, electromagnetic fields, quantum fields, etc., which form part of the very structure of reality.

These unseen influences affect the behavior of atoms, objects, and people. But fields don’t just exist in nature and physics; they exist in social systems as well. For example, think about the power of ideas in human affairs—a powerful idea has no substance, but one cannot doubt its influence. Note too the power of good and evil on people and societies. I use this idea to try and communicate that leadership itself creates an invisible field wherein certain behaviors take place. To try to conceptualize leadership as influence, think of a magnet and its effect on iron filings scattered on a sheet of paper. When the filings come into the orbit of influence of the magnet, they form a certain pattern that we all recognize from our school days. I think leadership does exactly the same thing—it creates a field, which in turn influences people in a certain way, just as the magnet influences the iron filings.

## Fitness Landscape

Essentially, a context that tests the fitness of a living system, be it an organism or an organization.

## Hebraic

Refer to Biblical Hebraic above. Essentially, the worldview nurtured primarily by the Bible. Hebraic in the broader sense can also mean the worldview of the Jewish people as a racial group, deeply influenced as it is by Judaism.

## Hellenism

The way it is used in this book is as a contrast to Hebraic thinking.

Hellenism is the ideologies that shaped and informed the Greek worldview. Together with Roman ideas it formed the basis of the worldview of the Roman Empire, and as the church moved further away from its Hebraic roots, Hellenism became the predominant worldview of the Christendom church.

Incarnational The incarnation refers to the act of God in entering into the created universe and realm of human affairs as the man Jesus of Nazareth.

When we talk of incarnational in relation to mission, it means similarly embodying the culture and life of a target group in order to meaningfully reach that group of people from within their culture. I also use the term to describe the missionary act of going to a target people group as opposed to the Invitation to come to our cultural group in order to hear the gospel.

I nstitution and I nstitutionalism I nstitutions are organizations initially set up in order to fill a necessary religious and social function and to provide some sort of structural support for whatever that function needs. In many ways this is the very purpose of structure, as organizations are needed if we seek to act collectively for common cause, for example, the original purpose of denominations. The problem happens when institutions move beyond being mere structural support and become a governing body of sorts.

My working definition of institutionalization is that it occurs when we outsource an essentially grassroots/local function to a centralized structure/organization. Over time the centralized structure tends to become depersonalized and becomes restrictive of deviating behavior and freedom. In other words, it occurs when in the name of some convenience we get others to do what we must do ourselves. When this happens there is a transfer of responsibility and power/authority to the governing body. In this situation it inevitably becomes a locus of power that uses some of that power to sanction behaviors of its members that are out of keeping with the institution. It becomes a power to itself and begins to assert a kind of restrictive authority on nonconforming behaviors. The problem exaggerates when over time power is entrenched in the institution and it creates a culture of restraint. No one intends this in the first place; it seems to be just of our fallen human condition in relation to power. When institutions get to this point, they are extremely hard to change. Seen in this light, all great innovators and thinkers are rebels against institutionalism. We often see portrayals of the institution of the Roman Catholic Church on TV and in movies that highlight how oppressive religious institutionalism can get. And while these are sometimes a caricature, make no mistake there is real historical substance to this portrayal. Most non-Christian people in the West view most churches are repressive institutions, with some justification.

Jesus Movements When I refer to Jesus movements (or substitute this term with “phenomenal Christian or apostolic movements), I am primarily referring to the two test cases I have adopted, namely, those of the early church and the Chinese underground church. But the phrase also refers to those other amazing movements in history where exponential growth and impact occurred, for example, Wesley’s revival or Third World Pentecostalism today.

Leadership Matrix The term for apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral and didactic (teaching) leadership as it is drawn from the ministry matrix (see below and APEST). Viewed as such, leadership is a calling within a calling.

Liminality Liminality comes from the word liminal, which describes a boundary or threshold situation. In the way that it is used in this book, it describes the contexts or condition from which communitas can emerge.

Situations of liminality can be extreme, where the participant is literally cast out of the normal structures of life, is humbled, disoriented, and subjected to various rites of passage, which together constitute a form of test as to whether the participant will be allowed back into society and to transition to the next level in the prevailing social structure.

Liminality therefore applies to that situation where people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society, a place of danger and disorientation mDNA I have inserted the m to the letters DNA purely to differentiate it from the biological version—it simply means missionalDNA. What DNA does for biological systems, mDNA does for ecclesial ones. DNA in biological life

- is found in all living cells,
- codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited

traits beyond that of the initiating organism,

- is self-replicating, and
- carries vital information for healthy reproduction.

mDNA therefore does the same for the church as God has designed it. And with this concept/metaphor I hope to explain why the presence of a simple intrinsic, reproducible, central guiding mechanism is necessary for the reproduction and sustainability of genuine missional movements. As an organism holds together, and each cell understands its function in relation to its DNA, so the church in given contexts finds its reference point in its built-in mDNA.

## Memes and Memeplex

Essentially, a meme is to the world of ideas what genes are to the world of biology—they encode ideas in easily reproducible form. In this theory, a memeplex is a complex of memes (ideas) that constitute the inner structure of an ideology or a belief system. And like DNA, it seeks to replicate itself by mutation into evolving forms of ideas by adding, developing, or shedding memes as the situation requires.

Sounds strange, doesn’t it? Why this idea is so valuable is that the memeplex has the capacity to reproduce itself by embedding itself in the receiver’s brain and passing itself on from there to other brains via human communication. We all know the feeling of being captivated by an idea, don’t we? We get caught up into its life. In some way that is exactly the way we all got caught up into the gospel and so adopted a biblical worldview.

## Ministry matrix

This term is used to describe the ministry callings of the church in terms of the teaching of Ephesians4:7ff, namely, that the whole church is comprised of people who are apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral and didactic (teaching). Ephesians4:7 indicates that “to each one is given,” and 4:11 says, “It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers.” Therefore, the term ministry matrix applies the APEST model to the whole church and not just its leadership as per the more common interpretation. (cf. leadership matrix.) Missiology/ Missiological Missiology is the study of missions. As a discipline, it seeks to identify the primal impulses in the scriptures that compel God’s people into engagement with the world. Such impulses involve, for example, the missio Dei (the mission of God), the Incarnation, and the kingdom of God. It also describes the authentic church’s commitment to social justice, relational righteousness, and evangelism. As such missiology seeks to define the church’s purposes in light of God’s will for the world. It also seeks to study the methods of achieving these ends, both from scripture and from history. The term missiological simply draws off these meanings.

Missional Afavorite term: I use it to describe a certain type or mode of church, leadership, Christianity, etc. For example, a missional church is one whose primary commitment is to the missionary calling of the people of God. Missional leadership is that form of leadership that emphasizes the primacy of the missionary calling of God’s people, etc.

Missional Church Missional church is a church that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose as an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic organizing principle is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself not only is a product of that mission, but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people.

Missional ecclesiology Similar to above, The area of study that explores the nature of the Christian movements, and therefore the church, as they are shaped by Jesus and his mission. The attention is chiefly on how the church organizes and expresses itself when mission is the central focus.

Missional-Incarnational Aphrase I have coined to try describe the impetus that is part of significant Jesus movements in history. In putting the two words together, I hope to link the two practices that in essence form one and the same action. Namely, missional... the outgoing thrust of the Jesus movements, like the scattering of seeds or of the dispersion of bacteria in a sneeze. It is an essential aspect of Christianity’s capacity to spread itself and cross cultural boundaries. It is linked to the theology of the missio Dei (the mission of God), where God sends his Son and we ourselves become a sent people.

The incarnational side of the equation relates to the embedding and deepening of the gospel and church into host cultures. It will mean that in order to relate to and influence the host group, it will need to do it from within its cultural forms and expressions. This is linked directly to the Incarnation of God in Jesus.

Mode Another favorite word; it simply describes the method, style, or manner of that which it refers to. The online Encarta dictionary defines mode as “a way, manner, or form, for example, a way of doing something, or the form in which something exists.” Thus, the mode of the early church describes its methodology, its stance, its approach to the world, etc.

Movement In this book I use the term sociologically to describe the organizational structures and ethos of the missional church. I believe that the NT church was itself a movement and not an institution (cf. institution/institutionalism, above). I believe that to be genuinely missional, a church must always strive to maintain a movement style and ethos.

Operational Leadership Essentially, operational leadership is that type suited for organizations that are in relatively stable environments where maintenance and development of current programming constitute the core tasks of leadership. This form of leadership is built on the assumptions of social engineering and is thus built squarely on a mechanistic view of the world. It works, and is appropriate for some organizations: those who find themselves in situations of stability. Operational leadership works best when the problems faced can be dealt with by drawing upon a preexisting repertoire and are exploited with more speed, quality, or scale. It is usually a top-down form of leadership, where a solution is devised from above and rolled out through the ranks. If an organization requires downsizing, restructuring, or reducing costs, if sharpened execution is the key to success, then operational leadership is probably the best bet.
