Written with Darryn Altclass, it addresses the common reader question of how to apply Apostolic Genius principles in real-world contexts.

      "file": "01-introduction-to-the-forgotten-ways.mdx",
      "wordCount": 3898,
      "summary": "This introduction provides an overview of Apostolic Genius, the latent power within God's people that energized remarkable movements like the early church and the Chinese underground church. It explores how these movements grew exponentially despite having none of the typical church resources, and introduces the six elements of mDNA: Jesus Is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, Apostolic Environment, Organic Systems, and Communitas. The chapter frames the book's central question of how to recover and activate these forgotten ways in contemporary Western contexts."

      "file": "02-the-heart-of-it-all.mdx",
      "wordCount": 7523,
      "summary": "This chapter establishes 'Jesus Is Lord' as the foundational element of Apostolic Genius, tracing it from the Shema Yisrael through to the early Christian confession. It explores how remarkable movements distilled their message to its essence and lived by simple Christology, rejecting dualistic separations between sacred and secular. The chapter provides practical habits and practices for keeping Jesus at the heart of all things, including getting over dualism, making the Gospels the primary text, and shaping life, spirituality, missional engagement, and leadership on Jesus."

      "order": 3,
      "file": "03-disciple-making.mdx",
      "wordCount": 6271,
      "summary": "This chapter emphasizes disciple-making as perhaps the most critical element of mDNA, focusing on becoming like Jesus and embodying his mission. It contrasts authentic disciple-making with the challenge of consumerism and explores how Jesus formed disciples through life-on-life relationships. The chapter provides habits and practices for raising the bar on discipleship, developing disciple-making practices, and activating the priesthood of all believers through empowerment, action-reflection processes, and coaching."

      "file": "04-missional-incarnational-impulse.mdx",
      "wordCount": 7782,
      "summary": "This chapter explores the twin impulses of missional (outward movement) and incarnational (embedding deep into culture) practices that together seed and embed the gospel. It examines how remarkable movements combined these approaches, with missional referring to the sending nature of God's mission and incarnational referring to identifying with and embedding within host communities. The chapter provides extensive practical guidance on going out (proximity, frequency, spontaneity) and going deep (meaningful engagement, proclamation, holy living, hospitality, contextualizing community, and sending)."

      "type": "chapter",
      "order": 5,
      "file": "05-apostolic-environment.mdx",
      "wordCount": 7334,
      "summary": "This chapter explores the apostolic environment needed for Apostolic Genius to flourish, focusing on apostolic leadership's role in embedding, guarding, and creating environments for mDNA. It examines the three primary functions of apostolic ministry: pioneering new ground, guarding mDNA through apostolic theology, and creating environments where other ministries (APEST) emerge. The chapter provides habits and practices for pioneering and multiplying, cultivating Apostolic Genius, fostering community calling and uniqueness, developing ministry capacity, and catalyzing connections and resources."

      "type": "chapter",
      "order": 6,
      "file": "06-organic-systems.mdx",
      "wordCount": 7957,
      "summary": "This chapter explores organic systems as the inner structures that enable exponential, movement-type growth, contrasting them with institutional approaches. It examines how the church should function as a living system with networked structures, viruslike growth, and simplicity for reproducibility. The chapter provides habits and practices for stirring up movement, structuring organically (distributing power, becoming learning organizations, structuring around life and existing energy), networking and communicating extensively, and 'sneezing the gospel' through simplexity, releasing early and often, and aiming for viruslike growth."

      "order": 7,
      "file": "07-communitas-not-community.mdx",
      "wordCount": 4980,
      "summary": "This chapter explores communitas as the deep comradeship that emerges from shared ordeal, liminality, and mission, drawing on Victor Turner's anthropological work. It distinguishes communitas from typical community, showing how remarkable movements developed through dangerous journeys and adaptive challenges rather than safe, artificial environments. The chapter provides habits and practices for developing transformative vision, positioning the church within the hub of life, engaging in shared endeavors, and putting adventure back into the venture through risk-taking and experimentation."
