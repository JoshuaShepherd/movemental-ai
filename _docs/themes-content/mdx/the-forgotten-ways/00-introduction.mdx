# Introduction

About four years prior to releasing the first edition I attended a seminar on missional church where in making a point the speaker asked a question: "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?" He then asked: "And how many do you think there were when Constantine came on the scene, say, AD 310?"2 Here are the somewhat surprising answers:

- AD 100: as few as 25,000 Christians
- AD 310: up to 20,000,000 Christians

He then asked the question that has haunted me to this day: "How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?"

It was as if God was calling me to dedicate myself to finding the answer. It was a quest to understanding what it is that could produce such amazing growth and impact. I wanted to apply my findings for the church in any other time and place, including of course the twenty-first century. I totally dedicated myself to the task. This quest led me to discover a generative system that undergirds all genuine, highly transformative expressions

 So let me ask you the same question: How do you think those early Chris-
 factor into the equation:

 - They were members of an illegal religion throughout this period. At best,

 they were tolerated; at the very worst they were very severely persecuted.

 - They didn’t have church buildings as we know them. While archae-

 ologists have discovered “chapels” dating from this period, they were
 verted houses.

 - They didn’t even have the Scriptures as we now have them. They were

 putting the canon together during this period.

 - They didn’t have a formal institution or the professional type of leader-

 ship normally associated with it. At times of relative calm, prototypical
 tional, these were at best pre-institutional.

 - They didn’t have seeker-sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands,

 seminaries, commentaries, and so on, all the things we assume that we

 - They actually made it hard to join the church. By the late second century,

 aspiring converts had to undergo a significant initiation period to prove
 they were worthy of joining the community of the baptized.

 to solve the problems of the church, yet they grew from as few as twenty-five
