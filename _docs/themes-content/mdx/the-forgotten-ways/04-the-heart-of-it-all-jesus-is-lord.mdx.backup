# The Heart of It All: Jesus Is Lord

> For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.
>
> —1 Corinthians 8:6

> The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its elements is a very simple thing. It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great numbers of paid officials. It has nothing to do with these things and would be hindered by them. It depends on nothing but the Spirit of God working through men and women who are indwelt by that Spirit, and who are willing to die to themselves that Christ may live in them, and who are ready to be broken bread and poured-out wine in his service. It requires nothing but the kindling of the Spirit, and that a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the wealth of this world, but one who, uniting a man to Christ, sets him on fire.

When Paul completes his exploration into the mystery of God's involvement in human history, he brings us to the very essence of reality. He says, "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! 'Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?' ... For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen" (Rom. 11:33–36). In a moment of spiritual inspiration, the clarity of truth dawns on Paul in its utter simplicity, and he expresses his understanding of God: "for from him and through him and for him are all things." This is the transcendent spiritual-theological core that pervades the entire Bible. And it is this transcendent spiritual-theological core that we will try to reinterpret our faith and following of Jesus in light of the Hebraic understanding of life. And it is this transcendent spiritual-theological core that we will try to reinterpret our faith and following of Jesus in light of the Hebraic understanding of life, particularly the Shema Yisrael (Hear, O Israel), based on Deuteronomy 6:4.1

The centrality of Jesus is more than just a singular "element" of Apostolic Genius. All genuine Christian movements throughout history have been maintained throughout by what we can call the consciousness of the lordship of Jesus, the absolute centrality of Christ, which is the one true God "through whom all things came and through whom we live" (1 Cor. 8:6), and who claims us as his own through Jesus our Savior. If we fail to apprehend this spiritual reality, we can never fully understand them or reinvoke the power that infused their movements. Roland Allen, in his study of movements, is right to conclude that they are maintained throughout by what he calls the "supreme importance of Jesus."2 While in some sense this is an mDNA "element" of Apostolic Genius, it is actually the organizing principle that informs and qualifies all the various mDNA elements of Apostolic Genius. It is, after all, all about God in Christ.

## Distilling the Message

Most people, when asked about how they think the early Christian movement (and the Chinese underground churches) grew so remarkably, answer that it was because of the extraordinary commitment and abiding authenticity to their faith and that they therefore accessed the power of God in a special way. When people are willing to die for the faith, one has moved beyond easy believism into the realms of authentic discipleship. The courage and faithfulness evident in the lives of these people cannot fail to inspire. Persecution drives the persecuted back to the core of their faith—to Jesus and thus unlock its liberating power.

The "gift" that persecution seems to confer on the persecuted is that it enables them to distill the essence of the gospel message. The Chinese church is a perfect example. When all the external structures and reference points were removed, when all access to outside sources was cut off, they were somehow forced through sheer necessity to rediscover the core message they had always carried as the people of God. The result was a Jesus movement that grew from around 2 million to around 120 million in seventy years! What was going on here?

We know that persecuted Jesus movements are driven underground, are forced to operate through relational networks in order to sustain themselves as self-conscious Christian communities. In such situations, they have to jettison all unnecessary impediments, including all unwieldy concepts, structures, and theologies. They are forced to condense and purify their core message that keeps them both faithful and effective. All the weighty systematic theologies and churchly dogma that only a professional clergy can understand are stripped away. All unnecessary complexities are extracted, and in the process a miracle happens—a simple, reproducible, transferable faith is born. Faith is once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus, the Author and Completer of the faith. At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple, uncluttered message—one that is easily understood and passed on, yet one that accurately reflects the Jesus of New Testament faith—they are Jesus-shaped movements.

Something else is unleashed in this recovery of simplicity—namely, the viral nature of the gospel. The reference to sneezing is not just whimsical. We know from the study of ideas that they spread like viruses, and in order to really take hold and become an "epidemic," they have to be easily transferable from person to person. They have to be simple—easily grasped by any person, and in many cases illiterate peasants.3 The gospel is not purely of religious institutions that unwittingly make it hard for people to access. With the right conditions and the right people relationships, easily transferable ideas can create powerful movements.

This is clearly the situation of the gospel in the early church as well as during the Chinese revival—the reliance on his Spirit, and the distillation of the gospel message into the simplest possible form, unlocked the missional potencies inherent in the people of God. The fact that movements can grow exponentially (and keep multiplying even while dying) by its message is a massive clue to the nature of Apostolic Genius. In our context, we need to once again appreciate its core—namely, that of the lordship of Jesus and his claim on our lives (kingdom and covenant).
