 The emerging expression of church has come about through precisely this
 It has come about from the movements within the church that I have discussed

 - From missional theology (e. g., David Bosch), we learned to see the church

 through the lens of mission and not the other way around.

 - From best practices in missions and missions theory, we learned how

 to do cross-cultural mission that doesn’t at the same time violate the
 natural fabric of the host cultures.

 - From urban mission among the poor (and to some degree liberation

 theology), we learned about incarnating the gospel, and it reminded us

 - From evangelical theology, we learned to value the gospel, the evangel,

 as the central organizing principle of theology.

 - Pentecostalism and the charismatic movement taught us the real value

 America.

 - And from living-systems theory (as in this chapter), we rediscovered the

 organic nature of faith and community and our innate ability to adapt
 redemptive mission to the world.
