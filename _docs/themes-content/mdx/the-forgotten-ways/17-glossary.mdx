# Glossary

 I see this book as an attempt to explore Apostolic Genius and to try to
 yet ancient way of engaging the twenty-first century.

## Attractional Church

 Essentially, attractional church operates from the assumption that to bring
 type or mode of engagement that was birthed during the Christendom period

 and therefore expected people to “come and hear the gospel” rather than
 attractive.

## Biblical Hebraic

 Describes the worldview that basically formed, framed, and sustained the
 Scriptures. “Hebraic” on its own can encompass the insights of later Juda-

## Chaos and Chaos Theory

 Chaos theory is a new scientific discipline that seeks to explore the nature of
 not only to organisms but also to human organizations, which are considered
 living systems, chaos is not necessarily a negative thing but can be the context
 that fail to respond appropriately to the conditions of chaos. See chapter 9

## Christendom

 Describes the standardized form and expression of the church and mission
 to note that it was not the original form in which the church expressed itself.
 church, which was made up of a network of grassroots missional commu-
 characteristics:

1. Amode of engagement that is attractional as opposed to missional/

 sending. It assumes a certain centrality of the church in relation to its
 and operates in the incarnational mode.)

2. Ashift of focus to dedicated, sacred buildings/places of worship. The

 association of buildings with church fundamentally altered the way the

3. The emergence of an institutionally recognized, professional clergy class

 acting primarily in a pastor-teacher mode. (In the New Testament church,

 people were commissioned into leadership by local churches or by an
 or institutional ordination we know in Christendom, which had the ef-
 the lay Christian. The idea of a separated clergy, I maintain, is alien to
 church and China.)

4. The institutionalization of grace in the form of sacraments adminis-

 tered by an institutionally authorized priesthood. (The New Testament
 Jesus in the context of everyday life and the home.)

## Christocentric

 Simply that Christ is center. If something is Christocentric, then its organizing

## Church Planting

 The initiation and development of new, organic, missional-incarnational
 aims at the development of communities of faith. Thus church planting is an

## Communitas

 Adopted from the work of anthropologist Victor Turner, who used the term
 rican boys (see liminality). As a key element of mDNA, the related ideas of
 inspired to overcome their instincts to “huddle and cuddle,” and to instead
 ous journey to unknown places, a mission that calls the church to shake off
 will experience disorientation and marginalization but also will encounter
 God and one another in a new way. Communitas is therefore always linked
 with the experience of liminality. It involves adventure and movement, and
 among a group of people inspired by the vision of a better world actually

## Complexity

 Complexity is related to a situation of chaos. In essence, living-systems theory
 of complexity. Complexity also acknowledges that when we are dealing with
 actions can have significant consequences in the system.

## Constantinianism

 Another word for Christendom because Christendom was basically initiated
 the state. Constantinianism is the type of all modes of church that resulted
 for the last seventeen centuries.

## Cultural Distance

 Aconcept that helps us to assess just how far a people group is from a meaning-
 that looks like this:
 | | | | |
 m0 m1 m2 m3 m4
 Each numeral with the prefix m indicates one significant cultural barrier

 to the meaningful communication of the gospel. An obvious example of such
 you have a problem. Other barriers could be race, history, religion/worldview,

 Describes the missional impulse of the Christendom church and that of the
 reach and evangelism must bring people back to church in order to facilitate

 Essentially, a context that tests the fitness of a living system, be it an organ-

 Refer to Biblical Hebraic, above. Essentially, the worldview nurtured primarily
 of the Jewish people as a racial group, deeply influenced as it is by Judaism.

318 Glossary of Key Terms

## Hellenism

 In this book used as a contrast to Hebraic thinking. Hellenism is the ideol-
 ideas it formed the basis of the worldview of the Roman Empire, and as the
 predominant worldview of the Christendom church.

## Incarnational

 The incarnation refers to the act of God in entering into the created universe
 incarnational in relation to mission, it means similarly embodying the culture
 from within their culture. I also use the term to describe the missionary act
 cultural group in order to hear the gospel.
 I nstitution and I nstitutionalism
 I nstitutions are organizations initially set up to fill a necessary religious and
 that function needs. In many ways this is the very purpose of structure, as
 for example, the original purpose of denominations. The problem arises
 a governing body of sorts. My working definition of institutionalization is
 centralized structure/organization. Over time the centralized structure tends

## Leadership Matrix

 Apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral, and didactic (teaching) leadership
 leadership is a calling within a calling.

## Liminality

 Comes from the word “liminal,” which describes a boundary or threshold situa-
 can emerge. Situations of liminality can be extreme, where the participant is
 and subjected to various rites of passage, which together constitute a test of
 the next level in the prevailing social structure. Liminality therefore applies to
 in relation to the surrounding society, a place of danger and disorientation.
 mDNA
 I have appended the m to the letters DNA purely to differentiate it from the
 biological systems, mDNA does for ecclesial ones. DNA in biological life

- is found in all living cells,
- codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits beyond

 that of the initiating organism,

- is self-replicating, and
- carries vital information for healthy reproduction.

## Missiology/Missiological

 Missiology is the study of missions. As a discipline, it seeks to identify the
 with the world. Such impulses involve, for example, the missio Dei (the mis-
 authentic church’s commitment to social justice, relational righteousness, and
 evangelism. As such, missiology seeks to define the church’s purposes in light
 of God’s will for the world. It also seeks to study the methods of achieving

## Missional

 Afavorite term I use to describe a certain type or mode of church, leader-
 primary commitment is to the missionary calling of the people of God. Mis-
 missionary calling of God’s people, and so forth.

## Missional Church

 A church that defines itself and organizes its life around its real purpose as
 authentic organizing principle is mission. When the church is in mission, it
 also is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The
