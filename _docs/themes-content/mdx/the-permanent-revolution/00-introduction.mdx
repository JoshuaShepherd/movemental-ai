# Introduction

As significant as external factors are, much of our infertility arises from within the community of faith: in the dynamics of our human sin and unfaithfulness, our lack of audacious faith, and a historical, all-too-human penchant for doing things according to our own preferences when it comes to running the church.

Acknowledging that we are not all that God intended us to be is not meant to simply create guilt and endless self-recriminations in God’s people.

Rather, acknowledging our shortfalls gives us an opportunity to repent.

And it is repentance that allows us to be forgiven for our infertility and intransigence, to recalibrate, and so start again.

The gift of repentance allows us to seek new solutions for the way we can reconceive of and restructure our life in God and in accordance with his eternal purposes in the gospel.

This is sheer grace, and we should embrace it wholeheartedly in our common life as much as in our personal one.

And it should certainly be a living aspect of what it means to be a believing church full of faith.

## Doubt and the Permanent Devolution

If believing the gospel (under guidance of the Spirit) means to align ourselves with God's purpose, form the ecclesia, and provide a guiding principle to plot our way forward, then it is what we call missional doubt (doubt that affects the mission and purposes of God through the church) that will undermine that belief.

In matters of spirituality, doubt and unbelief change everything; they affect the way we see ourselves and how we go about being the kind of people we were intended to be.

Under the corrosive influences of missional doubt and unbelief, there is no permanent revolution; instead we devolve into a self-focused, missionally reticent, risk-averse institution, inching our way ever closer toward our own demise.

Sociologists of religion have long acknowledged that decline in the church is associated with ever-encroaching doubt.

Because entrenched doubt prevents us from aligning with God’s design and intent, it heralds inevitable infertility and decline in the people of God.

Witness the cycles of disintegration and renewal in the stories of Israel in the Old Testament.

Whenever Israel refused to follow God’s distinctive ways, it led to decline and judgment.

And renewal, brought about by repentance, inevitably involved a realignment with his purposes and ushered in a period of blessing.

It is no different in the church.

As you can see in Figure I.1, the first, and seemingly innocuous, form of doubt in the life cycle of movements is referred to as operational.

Introduction involves a struggle in the organization to keep pace with its missional functions and objectives.

In other words, organizational doubt is first experienced as a problem of wineskins—the situation where prevailing organizational systems and designs originally used to host and transmit the founding ideals no longer get the job done.

It goes like this: “We very much believe our message, but we can’t seem to deliver it as effectively as we used to, and we feel bad about it.” Operational doubt will become caustic and destructive unless the church’s organizational expressions are appropriately realigned to more adequately suit its purposes and mission.

Unless it is properly resolved, this doubt will become entrenched and gnaw away at the soul of the ecclesia.

We have all seen this process: If the problem of wineskins is not resolved through the renewal of structures, the community will proceed to the next stage of ever-increasing cynicism and unbelief.

Unresolved operational doubt leads to ideological doubt, where we begin to no longer believe the message itself, and from there the organization devolves to ethical doubt, where we begin to behave badly because there is no good reason not to.

This life cycle eventually ends with absolute doubt, which precipitates closure: the death of the original movement.

Theology, history, and sociology affirm the truth of this progression.

It is plainly evident in the long-term trajectory of decline of the mainline denominations (most of which are predominantly theologically liberal in orientation ).

All of them, without exception, have inexorably declined over the past 150 years.3 In the end, systematic, structural, ethical, and ideological doubt, of both liberal and fundamentalist varieties, involves a failure to be the people God intended us to be: a radical, hard-core, fully engaged, living movement of people loved and redeemed by Jesus, committed to his causes on earth.

A doubt-filled church inevitably lacks the spiritual resources needed to empower dynamic movements.

Instead of gathering a growing number of disciples, developing leaders, and adapting the organization, it will tend, rather slothfully, to rely on tired solutions arising from a wornout, traditionalist paradigm of church—one that has patently failed in Christendom Europe, the very context that gave us that paradigm in the first place.

This lack of growth, development, and adaptation is a call for repentance and change.

We can be sure that more of the same will not deliver fundamentally different results.

It is time to reappraise the way we think about ourselves as ecclesia and how we go about fulfilling our calling.

This needed audit must include how we think about and practice ministry and leadership.

In other words, we need to rescript by returning to the original script.

It is time to recover the power of Ephesians 4:11 ministry in general and the missional potencies of the apostolic in particular.

## Of Black Swans, Algorithms, and Revolutions

We have already hinted at an idea that we reassert repeatedly in this book: Jesus has given the church everything it needs to get the job done.

The church is equipped by Spirit and gospel to fulfill whatever tasks the Lord has set for us to do: evangelism, discipleship, church planting, serving the poor, worship, healing, and much more.

We are designed to be the world-transforming agents of the kingdom.

We are meant to be a permanent revolution, not one that came and went, leaving a codified religion in its wake.

That we only seldom realize this truth can be attributed to a bad case of recurring theological amnesia, one that has some seriously detrimental consequences on our capacities to get our mission done.

Every now and again, we recover something of the original potencies associated with apostolic movements.

Perhaps most times we are forced into this discovery through situations that require us to adapt or die.

For example, it took the death of the institutional forms of church in China for it to become a dynamic people movement again.

But every now and again, we do it for the best possible reasons: out of our desire to be authentic and faithful to what the Lord of the church requires of us.

Part of the amnesia comes from the way we conceive of, and subsequently configure, the church and its ministry.

We create a paradigm— a way of perceiving our world, of filtering out what is considered real and unreal, of creating mental models of how things should be.

Once established, paradigms in many ways do our thinking for us; that is their purpose.

They in turn comprise clusters of what creative thinking expert Roger Martin calls algorithms.4 An algorithm is a predetermined formula that will produce reliable outcomes when it is consistently applied.

Although paradigms help us make sense of our world by giving us ways to interpret it, they also create what is called paradigm blindness: an incapacity to see things from outside that particular perspective or paradigm.

And this can account for how people fail to see certain important things that might be glaringly obvious to others.

It can also account for many of the problems we in the church now face.

But there is another serious downside to algorithms, as Martin so effectively articulates: “What organizations dedicated to running reliable algorithms often fail to realize is that while they reduce the risk of small variations, ... they increase the risk of being overpowered by the various cataclysmic events that occur, introduction situations when the future no longer resembles the past and whatever algorithm one has used is no longer relevant or useful.”5

Paradigms and algorithms are good only as long as they match and interpret external conditions.

When the context shifts significantly, algorithms can become problematic because they can prevent an organization from readily seeing its way beyond them.

Now this should be beginning to sound all too familiar to us.

The Bible tends to call this a stronghold— a mental or spiritual trap.

For instance, well-worn formulas are used to define what it is to be a church (referred to as the marks of the church): that the church exists where the sacraments are rightly administered and where church discipline is seldom submitted to critical review.

And yet without some serious theological gymnastics, they are patently deficient, especially in making space for the tasks of mission, discipleship, and human community.6 They are assumed to be true, just the way denominational templates are.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb refers to the impact of unforeseen occurrences as “black swan events”: events that the prevailing models could never have foreseen, let alone predicted, and yet they account for just about every major shift in human history.7 In other words, game-changing events are outliers—phenomena that deviate markedly from what is expected and seen as normal.

The 2008 financial crisis is one such event; others are the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; the rise of the Internet; the 2010 British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

In the same way, our inherited algorithm of church, ministry, and leadership is now being seriously challenged.

It has no way of engaging the escalating bombardment of black swan–level events that our increasingly complex, globalized context seems to usher in regularly.

This crisis is not just in the church.

In many ways, the crisis is universal.

Joshua Cooper Ramo, managing director of Kissinger and Associates, a major geostrategic advisory firm, has written a rather prophetic book, The Age of the Unthinkable.8 As Ramo would have it, many of the problems we face today arise from applying outmoded nineteenth-century thinking to twenty-first-century problems.

He suggests that we live in a “revolutionary age,” defined by problems whose complexity, unpredictability, and interconnectedness increasingly defy our efforts at control: terrorism, global warming, pandemics, and financial meltdowns, for example.

States no longer dominate, new actors abound, and the day belongs to the agile and adaptive.

In other words, we live in a situation defined by an increasing frequency of black swan events.

These threatening new dynamics demand, in Ramo’s view, nothing less than “a complete reinvention of our ideas of security,” even the reversal of “a couple of millennia of Western intellectual habits.” We must innovate and keep learning, and we must become resilient and adaptive.9

The penalty for nonadaptive behavior is severe.

Unforeseen events happen more regularly and challenge the formulas and responses gleaned from a retrospective glance at history.

As writer and social observer Malcolm Gladwell tells us, black swan events play a much bigger role in shaping success and failure than we tend to think.10 Generally planning and good management do not determine success; rather, success comes from being able to respond well to forces out of our control that push us to innovate and adapt.

For instance, if you are taking a leisurely stroll in a forest, everything seems fine until you get hopelessly lost.

Then everything changes.

When you are lost, the forest takes on a menacing aspect.

Mere objects in normal life now become a potential threat, a tool, or perhaps something to ingest.

When this happens, we see our world in a different light and so behave differently; we find ourselves in a learning mode.

It is not too presumptuous to say that the church in the West appears to be lost in the forest, a menace indeed, but this is equally an invitation to ongoing learning, something fundamental to our calling as disciples of Jesus.

A model’s success is always dependent on a certain level of congruence between that model and its environment.

What Martin, Ramo, Taleb, and Gladwell are highlighting is the limited capacity of a successful organizational model to endure beyond a specific time or survive a climactic event.

The reality is that in a complex world with an ever-increasing rate of discontinuous change, we can use an existing approach only until the environment shifts, or a black swan requires an adaptive solution. A simple improvement in current practices will no longer do in these circumstances.

When strategy and environment are radically incongruent, innovative strategies have to be explored in order to reengage that environment.

The old Christendom algorithm in the church is failing as Christianity in the West begins to adjust to the increasing decentering it has experienced over the past few decades.

This has created a great sense of anomaly that has precipitated a much-needed paradigm shift in the Western Christianity.

But if we do not change at this point, we must expect Christianity to continue in its long-term, seemingly inexorable decline in every Western setting.

Our ability to adapt and respond to this failure of algorithms will determine the future viability of Christianity in Western cultural contexts.

The two of us think the signs of a serious rethinking are promising, but we must all be willing to change the algorithms when and where appropriate or face the consequences. introduction What is exciting about the crisis—and it is that—is that we are being forced to wake up from our institutional slumbers, shake off our complacencies, and rediscover the apostolic movement.

Marx rightly called organized religion the opiate of the people.

Like all other drugs, it dulls us to the realities we must face.

Our situation today requires that we renew our covenants with the Lord of the church, trust his Holy Spirit, dig deep into our own self-understanding, and in this way recover our purpose as well as our latent and unused potentials as God’s people.

We were never meant to settle down and become a civil religion; there is no indication of that in our primary scripts.

It is time to become again the permanent revolution that we are meant to be in the first place.

Two major algorithms need a thorough reformulation: the ways that we think about church and the ways that we envision ministry and leadership.

The two are inextricably tied together, and the natural link is found in the term apostolic, the key theme of this book.

Ecclesia as Apostolic Movement

We have already hinted at an assumption that underlies the writing of this book: that many of the problems the church now faces can be resolved simply by thinking differently about it and its God-designed mission in the world.

By changing our metaphors, or paradigms of church, we can change the game.

The name we give to this different paradigm of church is simply apostolic movement.

It is not new—in fact, it is ancient—and it is the only way to describe the fluidity and dynamism of the spiritual phenomenon we see evidenced in the New Testament itself.

In short, apostolic movement involves a radical community of disciples, centered on the lordship of Jesus, empowered by the Spirit, built squarely on a fivefold ministry, organized around mission where everyone (not just professionals) is considered an empowered agent, and tends to be decentralized in organizational structure.

We have spent much of our adult years trying to understand and unlock the dynamism inherent in apostolic movements. I (Alan) have written extensively on various aspects of it.

But in many ways movemental ecclesiology—the church reconceived as movement—can be located, and summed up, in the primary term for church in the New Testament: ecclesia.

If we understood ecclesia properly and began to reappropriate its various levels of meaning, then many of the problems we now face can be resolved.

For instance, our more concrete, institutionalized idea of church must be redefined in the much broader, more fluid meaning used in the Bible.

And as we generally use the term throughout this book, here we set out some of the levels of meaning inherent in it.

We can discern four ways, in four ascending levels, in which the word ecclesia is used (Figure I.2):

Paul uses the term to describe the people who met in the various places of their city—primarily the home (called an oikos in the Greek), but riverbanks, markets, and other places as well.

For example, Paul addresses the ecclesia that happens to meet in so-and-so’s house.

This is the most local, or basic, reference of the term.

Then Paul (and the other apostles) talk of an ecclesia in a particular city, knowing that there might in fact be many house churches scattered throughout the area.

In fact, most of the letters are addressed to churches at this level.

So here we have the regional application of the term—a citywide ecclesia that is in fact made up of many ecclesias.

Level 1 Ecclesia as local church: Manifests in houses, riverbanks, schools, and other places

Level 2

Ecclesia as a citywide phenomenon: Manifests across a city or region

Level 3

Ecclesia as a translocal movement: Manifests across cultural and geopolitical divides

Level 4 Ecclesias as the universal body of Christ: Manifests as the people of God

The next level up is that it is used to denote the movement across a larger geopolitical region—in this case, the Roman Empire, or Asia.

Here the word is used to identify the Jesus movement in the various parts of the world known in the apostles’ time.

We still use it to refer to a historical phenomenon.

The final, and the most symbolic, level is where the apostles can address the people of God as the church of Jesus Christ, meaning, of course, the universal invisible church, that is, the body of Christ on earth.

This is the more theological, metaphorical meaning of the term as the redeemed new covenant people of God.

To put this concept in the framework of algorithms we have been discussing, the biblical algorithm being communicated through the word ecclesia represents God’s people as a dynamic, translocal, social force that manifests in multidimensional ways.

Jesus advances this vision of the ecclesia as movement when he maps out the trajectory of the church going from Jerusalem, to Judea, to Samaria, and ultimately to the ends of the earth.11 Ecclesia is a movement or, more technically, an apostolic movement.

By engaging this distinctly movemental view of ecclesia, we can no longer limit it to a local church with a distinctive building and a certain denominational preference and style.

That is the institutional algorithm.

The apostolic movement is far more wide-ranging.

Just as the ecclesia as apostolic movement in the New Testament spanned the Roman Empire, so too our notion of the church must expand to biblical proportions.

This new, yet also ancient, ecclesia as apostolic movement algorithm will allow us to unlock the meaning and potential of church in our day.

We have to think differently, and more broadly, about ourselves for everything else to fall into place.

Apostolic Leadership for Missional Movement

Thinking like a movement instead of an institution has massive implications because an authentic missional church should exist and express itself at all four levels to be the kind of church that Jesus envisioned.

This expands the equation of church and in so doing forces us to completely rethink our understanding of its associated ministry, leadership, and organization.

No longer can leadership be limited to the local.

It must include that but go beyond it to be able to include the other three levels: city, region, and symbolic.

And to do this, we cannot apply the age-old shepherd-teacher algorithm that has prevailed in the church over the past seventeen centuries.

This formulation cannot provide the impetus for the kind of movement that is needed now—the kind of movement we were meant to be in the first place.

Clearly we think that Ephesians 4 provides the way forward by giving us a direct link backward into the ministry that infused and led the early church.

In other words, we are convinced that we are dealing with the most foundational genetic codes of ministry in the ecclesia of Jesus Christ.

In APEST (the acronym we use for Ephesians 4:11 ministry: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers), we touch base with the primary algorithm of ministry in ecclesia.

And we can certainly say with confidence that in the New Testament itself, ministry was at least fivefold in form.

There can be no refuting this.

As a burgeoning apostolic movement, the original church had a built-in, highly dynamic ministry that included the holistic collaboration of the ministries of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher.

Together these provided an appropriately expansive ministry for an expanding movement.

In Part One, we discuss reestablishing this ministry algorithm into the twentyfirst-century church.

From that fuller discussion, we then focus on what we believe is the catalytic ministry of the apostle.

The apostle is the quintessentially missional form of ministry and leadership.

The apostolic role provides the key that unlocks the power of New Testament ecclesiology insofar as its ministry is concerned.

In the power of the Holy Spirit, apostles are given to the ecclesia to provide the catalytic, adaptive, movemental, translocal, pioneering, entrepreneurial, architectural, and custodial ministry needed to spark, mobilize, and sustain apostolic movements.

Apostolic ministry is the appropriate form for missional movements.

In fact, we doubt whether there can be significant movement in the church without it.

Nothing less than the renewal of the church and its mission is bound up with the rediscovery and reappropriation of this type of ministry.

Along the lines of the idea of reformata et semper reformanda (that the church reformed ought always to be reforming) we use the phrase “the permanent revolution” to connote the idea that the church that Jesus designed has built-in capacities for the ongoing renewal of its theology and practice, and that short of the return of our Redeemer King, we never arrive at a perfected state.

In other words, we ought to be in a state of a permanent, ongoing, transformative revolution.

We argue in this book that the apostolic ministry (and beyond it, all ministries described in Ephesians 4) is an intrinsic aspect of the ministry of the church in all ages.

Apostles are literally given to the ecclesia by Jesus (Ephesians 4:7, 11) to drive the permanent revolution that we are meant to be.

If the church is indeed called to be a permanent revolution, then it is APEST in general, and the apostolic in particular, that are called to be its permanent revolutionaries.12 Revolution and revolutionaries are inexorably bound together; the two go hand-in-glove; we cannot have one without the other.

If we have chosen to narrow the ministry of the church, then we have in that same choice chosen to limit the possible impact of the church.

And in so doing, we have messed with the design for impact.

We need apostolic ministry in order to foster the apostolic ecclesiology so needed in our day.

It is time for learning again what we should already know.

It is time to discover some of our most potent potentials that have been dormant for way too long.

It is time to become again a permanent revolution.
