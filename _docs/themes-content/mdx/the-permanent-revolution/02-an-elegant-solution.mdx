# An Elegant Solution

What he meant by "simple" was not simplistic and one-dimensional, but a solution that unlocks the mystery of complex problems—something ingenious.

His E = MC2 is a classic example of simplicity unlocking complexity.

Similarly, when scientists refer to something as an elegant solution, they are referring to situations where the maximum desired effect is achieved through the smallest, or simplest, effort.

An elegant solution is also likely to be accomplished with appropriate methods and materials, so, for instance, duct tape is not likely to be part of an elegant solution unless, of course, the problem involves taping ducts.

When we look at Ephesians 4, we are no doubt looking at the rare blessing of an elegant solution.

It has an implicitly beautiful symmetry that mirrors in a direct way the ministry of Jesus Christ, especially in comparison to the inelegant twofold shepherd-teacher approach that has dominated Christian history.

Having laid out some of the theological foundations for an APEST model, we now turn to giving some definition and meaning to the vocations as we see them.

Given the predominance of the shepherd and teacher understandings of ministry, we trust that most people reading this book already have a reasonably clear comprehension of these roles.

In addition, the chapters in Parts Two through Five explore the nature and function of the apostolic ministry, so we will give only the briefest of definitions here and leave the rest to later.

The main emphasis in this chapter is on the prophetic and the evangelistic ministries.

Approaching APEST from the angle that each ministry carries a certain intelligence, especially as a complement to the deeply biblical idea of calling or vocation, yields helpful insights.

We refer not only to IQ but also to emotional intelligence (EQ): the ability, capacity, and skill to perceive, assess, and manage one’s emotions.

Some aspects of EQ are personality based, and certainly some can be learned and developed.

This concept of having special aptitudes, or intelligences, also spans a wide variety of human capacities.

Clearly some people have a knack for business, others in seeing systems, and yet others in organization.

There are now widely used tests that gauge people’s political intelligence, social intelligence, creativity index, and so forth.

This idea of intelligences (or aptitudes) provides a valuable metaphor for unlocking the power and functionality of APEST: each particular ministry brings a unique vocational bias, a certain sensibility, and a heightened receptivity to issues that others cannot see.

Above all, each brings an enhanced capacity to the multidimensional tasks of the church.

We also suggest that each ministry is characterized by a type of intelligence: apostolic intelligence (AQ), prophetic intelligence (PQ), and so on.

The combination of these five APEST intelligences creates a synergistic, heightened intelligence in the people of God as a whole.

Individually and collectively, this intelligence directly strengthens the church’s capability to process and interpret information, be more agile and adaptive to changing conditions, communicate its core message in multiple settings, empower people into being whom God intended them to be, as well as to organize both locally and regionally.

Before we can look at this collective intelligence as a whole, we describe the aptitudes and characteristics of each APEST type. an elegant solution 29

Apostolic Intelligence: Custodian of the DNA The apostle is the custodian of the core and founding ideas (that is, its DNA) of the ecclesia.

The ministry is characterized by the following interrelated components:

Extension of Christianity as a whole onto new ground

Developing and maintaining systemwide health

Mobilizing for movement and broad impact

Maintaining glocal (a combination of global and local) networks and relationships1

Not surprisingly, apostolic types tend to favor the entrepreneurial edges of the church and have a natural capacity for adventure and risk.

They are systems-sensitive types who possess a keen intuition of the systemic dimensions of people movements (ordinary people mobilizing for extraordinary impact on society) and what it takes to initiate and maintain them.

Hence we generally use the term apostolic movements to refer to highly transformative, exponential people movements that shape the extension and mobilization of Christianity into new frontiers. A contemporary example is the various movements that make up the underground Chinese church with its rapid expansion through mission, church planting, and radical discipleship.

With this simple working definition in mind, we can turn to the other ministries in the Ephesians 4:11 mix, especially the prophetic and evangelistic ministries. (See Chapter Five for a comprehensive description of these functions.)

Prophetic Intelligence: Guardian of Faithfulness Prophets have always been perceived as those who are in the know.

In the Old Testament, where the roots of any biblical understanding of prophetic ministry lie, they are seen to be the God-intoxicated, biblical existentialists, calling all to live faithfully in covenant relationship with God and consistent with his kingdom and rule in the world.2 The effect of prophetic ministry is to bring our world into divine focus.

Although prophets have a futuristic orientation, their real focus is a call to live in the existential here-and-now of faithfulness and obedience.

It is certainly a caricature to see them as fortune-tellers, because even when they do predict or refer to the future, their primary concern is to motivate their listeners to live faithfully in light of that possible future.

In his classic work on prophets, Abraham Heschel rightly characterizes the prophet’s 30 the permanent revolution essential task as “declaring the word of God to the here and now; [disclosing] the future in order to illuminate what is involved in the present.”3

On the Edge of the Inside

Obsessed with the idea of covenantal faithfulness, prophetic ministry can be said to revolve around two questions:

Who is God? (What is his nature?)

What does God require of us in this particular place and time? (How then shall we live?).

These questions provide the focal point of prophetic sensibility or intelligence.

This fusion of God’s values and reality forms the first essential component of prophetic intelligence.

The prophet’s intimate connection with God and his concerns will almost always cause him or her to experience the divine pathos, or the suffering of God as he experiences the world.

They feel God’s intense pain, his longing, and his anger, and because of this, they tend to be passionate and spiritual people.

Like God, they feel strongly and deeply.

And because of this primary concern for God, his values, and his vision for the world, they seem to be able to sense situations where those values are not reflected.

They feel the sin and dysfunction in the world.

In this way, they function like canaries in the coal mine that because of their sensitivity to toxic environments keel over long before anyone detects something has gone wrong.

They notice what goes unnoticed: injustice, unfaithfulness, indifference toward God, and cruelty, for example.4

This experience of encountering two contradicting realities causes the prophet to passionately call into question the existing order of things.

Heschel again sheds light on the prophet’s unique ability to experience these two realities simultaneously: “The prophet’s eye is directed to the contemporary scene; the society and its conduct are the main theme of his speeches.

Yet his ear is inclined to God.

He is a person struck by the glory and presence of God, overpowered by the hand of God.

Yet his true greatness is his ability to hold God and man in a single thought.”5 Holding these two realities together creates tension within the prophet.

The prophet identifies the gaps between God’s reality and our own.

By forcing us to face up to these gaps in our faithfulness, the prophet creates a context that allows us to perceive the truth of our situation.

It is in this space that prophetic intelligence (or sensibility) plays its most critical role (see Figure 2.1).

an elegant solution 31 God’s Values and Reality The prophet’s recognition of this gap often requires a confrontation with personal and collective idolatry, especially in contexts where the institution has legitimized its particular worldview that makes some ideas possible and others unthinkable.6 The institutionalization of racism within the church leading up to and after the civil rights movement in the United States is a case in point.

Treating African Americans as equals within the church, much less in society, was literally unthinkable in most denominational practices.

As a result, people, and the institutions they inhabit, can find themselves being held hostage by their own logic and systems of justification.

In such situations, we need prophetic imagination to deconstruct and dismantle these systems of justification that so often conceal our fears and selfishness.

Recognizing the prophet’s distinct, focused role to awaken our imaginations partly explains why the prophetic person can often have an aversion, even disdain, for strategy and structured planning.

As a result of all the work of bridging God and humanity, prophets generally are not content with the status quo.

They tend to be always calling God’s people to greater degrees of faithfulness.

They question everything that does not seem to be God honoring and force us to face up to the distance between us and God.

They stir up the pot, rock the boat, move our cheese, harp, nag and agitate us until we pay attention to the areas of our individual and communal lives that do not reflect the values of the gospel and God’s kingdom.

As such they often evoke the darker, more self-protective human responses.

No wonder they tend to be killed, exiled, or simply marginalized. (See Matthew 14:1–5, 23:29–36; Hebrews 11.) God’s people have always struggled to hear and integrate prophetic messages, which is why so many prophets are rejected and isolated from the ministry of the church.7 But without them, it is hard to see how we can remain a faithful, covenantal people.

32 the permanent revolution

Criticize and Energize

Prophets generally draw attention to the gap by calling into question the current social, political, or theological arrangements.

And in this lies an important, even unique, gift to the church as an adaptive community.

Learning systems theory maintains that organizational learning takes place when programs are subjected to questions.

As the quintessential questioners, prophets play a critical role in developing a community’s capacity to adapt to its environment.

In his practical book Leading with Questions, human resource expert Michael Marquardt could well be speaking about the prophetic role when he says: “The failure to ask questions ... allows us to operate with a distorted sense of reality.” He refers to organizations that are unable to question their prevailing view of reality as zombies. A zombie organization, he says, is a walking corpse that does not yet know that it is dead “because it has created an insulated culture that systematically excludes any information that could contradict its reigning picture of reality.”8 If a community receives only positive feedback, it will never be able to discover its weak points or failures.

Prophets initiate the process of critical feedback that is necessary for organizational learning.

We need to give permission to prophets and their dissenting voices.

Stifling holy dissent is a guaranteed way to create bigger problems down the line. “Turn off your radar and you will eventually hit the side of a mountain.”9

The prophetic function is more than a purely critical one; it can also play an animating, profoundly revitalizing role.

In fact, in calling us to repent and change, the prophet opens us up to the ever-renewing encounter with God.

Walter Brueggemann therefore rightly characterizes the role of the prophet as one who both criticizes and energizes.10 These two categories suggest a continuum between criticizing and energizing on which prophetic ministry can be located, which points us to an important distinction: criticizing and energizing are not always given equal attention.

Genuine prophetic ministry will always include both, but with different degrees of emphasis.

Some who are called to function prophetically may have a more energizing effect to their ministry, while others may operate in a more critical fashion.

A Few Conditions

Because of the challenging nature of the prophetic ministry, it is important to maintain some biblical criteria for discerning the ministry of a prophet. an elegant solution 33

First, the role of the prophet is to call people back to God.

If the God they call us to is made known in Jesus Christ, then faithfulness must be defined as being faithful to Jesus and his mission.

To be sure, this includes ethics and social concerns, but it goes beyond that to be fully resonant with God’s heart for the nations.

Prophets in the new covenant not only call us back to God; they also call us forward to God’s preferred future for the world—one defined by the ministry and work of Jesus the Messiah.

In other words, it is messianic as well as missional in nature.

Second, criticism is not a license for cynicism.

Cynicism denies the possibility of future transformation and keeps prophets from engaging their context.

All faithful prophetic ministry should both criticize and energize, even if one of those functions receives more emphasis than the other.

The third important qualifier for prophetic ministry is love.

Because prophets are the guardians of the covenant, they must maintain a deepseated, covenantal love for God’s people no matter where and in what state they are in.

In other words, they live on the edge of the inside.11 Martin Luther King Jr. was fond of saying that those whom you would change you must first love, and given his specific context in so doing, he demonstrated a profoundly biblical, deeply covenantal, spirit so characteristic of the authentic prophet.

Fourth, critical distance should not translate into permanent distance.12 The prophetic vocation sometimes has to learn how to be the loyal opposition of remaining connected to the system while consistently challenging and prodding the system toward greater faithfulness.

Fifth, prophets are not infallible, and we are encouraged to always test the prophet’s message to see if it is from God.

As highly intuitive types, prophets have an uncanny knack for seeing things others cannot, but intuition can be right or wrong.

Collective discernment by the community needs to be applied to prophetic insight.

Finally, prophets need to be aware of their humanity and the possible ways that they might actually be contributing to the crisis they so passionately address.

Spending time away from the community and inhabiting God’s reality through prayer and meditation and identification with those on the margins can blind prophets to the ways in which their own lives and choices may be perpetuating problems within their own context.

The mystics were susceptible to an other-worldly ethic that detached them from the life of the everyday.

Mediating revelation does not absolve participation in today’s reality.

Prophetic ministry stands in the gap for sure, but it does so with one foot in God’s reality and one foot firmly anchored in the existing reality.

34 the permanent revolution

Good Reasons to Get it Right

Mike Kim, a self-confessed “former traditional pastor” in the Evangelical Free Church of America, went on a deep journey of discovery into the power of APEST ministry.

These are some of his insights about why prophetic ministry is so necessary:

Without the prophetic voice, we become overly pragmatic and mechanistic in our orientation towards effectiveness and success as a church.

From the prophetic perspective, the goals are wrong, and therefore the methods and metrics are too.13

Without prophetic witness, most Western Christians don’t expect God to speak to us.

His voice remains stuck on the pages of a book that only a professional can access and then spoon feed to us.

Without prophetic imagination to show us the possibilities, we don’t expect God to perform miracles in our midst and in our present era.

There is a concomitant loss of the sense of the God who is Lord of, and who intervenes in, history.

Without prophetic urgency, we don’t question status quo and are afraid to disturb social and traditional equilibrium— something that the prophetic consistently did to a stagnating people of God in the Old Testament.

Without the prophetic perspective, eschatological living (where past, present, and future are held together) has also been lost.

Eschatological living is the kind that asks “what kind of people should we then be?” (e.g. 2 Peter 3:10–14).

The future, as a meaningful concept and motivation, is relegated to a distant reality, not a present one.

And thus we function primarily from the past rather than the future in how we live out the present—which slows the pace and flattens the peaks of what can really happen.

Without prophetic modelling, we lose our transformational and radical edge: Prophets always model an alternative Reality.

They call us to live differently, to choose God’s ways over the ways of the world.

Without prophetic spirituality, our spirituality becomes intellectual, predictable and segmented.

We don’t embrace mystery and the mysterious aspects of spirituality and of communal life.

Faith takes on less and less risk and more and more intellectual assent in pursuit of “certainty” and orthodoxy. an elegant solution 35

And without prophetic longing, we are content with God being a distant Savior and Creator but lose the sense of him as Lover, Friend, Judge, Comforter, etc.

Spirituality becomes about right belief or even right practice—not right relationship [italics added].14

Evangelistic Intelligence: Recruiting to the Cause From what we can gather from observation and scripture, evangelists are always looking to create a positive encounter between people and the core messages of the church, especially the gospel.

Generally they spread the message and enlist others to the cause.

The Genius of Evangelists

Their genius—their specific intelligence—is therefore indicated in at least three ways.

EXCE P T IONA L R ECRU I T ERS.

The most obvious outcome of the ministry of evangelists is that people are enlisted to the cause of Christ.

In other words, the church grows.

Evangelists have the capacity to get significant buy-in from their hearers.

Although the concept of “salesmen” has negative connotations, Malcolm Gladwell’s category of the “salesmen” is highly applicable here: persuasive, viral-type people with seemingly infectious personalities.15 In terms of the diffusion of ideas and the spread of movements, salesmen are the persuaders—people with significant negotiation skills.

They tend to have an indefinable trait that goes beyond what they say and makes others want to agree with them.

For this reason, evangelists are agents of conversion.

SOCI A L CON NEC TORS .

It stands to reason that evangelists are great socializers—the kind of people who can link the rest of us up with the world: “They have a special gift for bringing the world together,” Gladwell says, and they “are the “handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [for] making friends and acquaintances.” Gladwell is useful here again in describing these kinds of people as connectors who have the kind of intrinsic confidence, curiosity, sociability, and energy that propel them into new relationships.16 They seem to have a capacity to make connections with people in a way that demonstrates what organizational psychologist Daniel Goleman calls social as well as emotional intelligence.17 In many ways, their function is therefore genuinely priestly 36 the permanent revolution in that they mediate between God and people as well as between people and people.

Yet the evangelistic ministry goes beyond their priestly capacity for relational engagement.

Evangelists also have an affinity for the gospel that makes them adept at applying it to people’s unique experience and circumstance.

SHARERS OF GOOD NEWS.

This is the obvious function of evangelistic people, but their sharing of good news is an inextricable part of their capacity to understand people and make connections.

In effect, evangelism involves making the connections between God and people as well as between people and people.

As ministers who work with what John Wesley called “prevenient grace”—the belief that God is involved in everyone’s life, calling them to himself in and through Jesus—evangelists help people see God’s love and calling in Jesus in their lives and so precipitate the conversion process.

This too is an intrinsic aspect of priestly ministry: mediating the knowledge of God.

A Deeper Appreciation, a Wider Application

Of all the APEST vocations, perhaps no other is more subject to caricature than evangelists: obnoxious Ramboesque street evangelists with their sign-here, make-the-deal, bait-and-switch methodology.

But this is a onedimensional parody of evangelists that distorts an irreplaceable ministry and needs to be overcome in order to come to grips with the biblical function.

In his book Conversion in the New Testament, Richard Peace provides the useful clue to broadening our understanding when he says that “how we conceive of conversion determines how we do evangelism.”18 According to Peace, the American church has typically understood the nature of conversion through the lens of Paul’s instantaneous conversion on the road to Damascus.

Consequently, evangelistic ministry for the most part has sought to reproduce that instantaneous, sudden experience of conversion by orchestrating events where people can encounter Jesus for the first time.

In many ways, this informs the rationale behind the seeker-sensitive model of church that looks to draw people into a controlled environment so someone (usually a charismatic speaker) can deliver a dynamic message.

Process and Event

Peace expands our understanding of evangelistic ministry by uncovering an additional paradigm of conversion in the New Testament, one that an elegant solution 37 often goes unnoticed because of where it is located and who is being “converted.” He demonstrates a paradigm of conversion in the gospel of Mark where the twelve apostles undergo a gradual, incremental process of conversion where they arrive at the true identity of Jesus, and its implications for discipleship, only after a lengthy process of discovery.19 John Finney, in Recovering the Past: Celtic and Roman Mission, sums up these two paradigms of conversion and their corresponding types of evangelism by using the phrases “road to Emmaus” and “road to Damascus.”20 The road to Emmaus involves process: walking with people through life, eating meals together, discussing Jesus and the meaning of scripture.

The road to Damascus looks to provide an event—that critical moment of persuasion and conviction to move people beyond their current place in the journey toward a decision to enter into covenant.

Although process and event are two entirely different approaches to evangelizing, they are both nonetheless legitimate methods of bringing people to a point of conversion.

Recovering a process-based paradigm of conversion expands our view of both evangelism and the ministry profile of an evangelist.

If evangelism can also be framed around metaphors of journey, pilgrimage, and quest, then an evangelist is not just a witty communicator who can set people on edge or a verbal jouster who specializes in confrontational, argumentative encounters.

The broader, more general portrait of the evangelist is a person who finds great satisfaction in being strategically instrumental in helping someone else move closer to Jesus, no matter what phase of the journey he or she is in.

Those more inclined to engage in process evangelism are likely to be energized by the thought of investing a lot of time, energy, emotions, and sometimes even financial resources in people over an extended period of time.

They will have a certain affinity for helping people assess where they are on their spiritual journey, asking thought-provoking questions and providing accurate metaphors and language to talk about God and spirituality.

Presence and Proclamation

Widening our perception about evangelistic ministry to include both processand event-based approaches raises questions about how the gospel is transmitted from person to person.

Just as some evangelists gravitate more toward a process approach, there is also room to differentiate between methods of communicating and delivering the message, between proclamation and presence.

Proclamation does not simply mean preaching in the popular sense, it has more to do with bringing something out into 38 the permanent revolution the open with our words.

This can take place by seeding an idea through metaphors or a story.

It can be polished rhetoric or casual conversation.

Basically proclamation can take on any form of verbal communication.

One of the reasons evangelism has been routinely narrowed down to the proverbial sales pitch or elevator speech is that the usual approach to sharing the gospel has yet to be refined by the Incarnation (not to mention that it is still based on an overly simplistic understanding of the gospel itself).

This is where the prophetic ministry is poised to enrich and broaden our understanding of evangelistic ministry.

Some evangelists demonstrate a knack for proclamation, and others take a more incarnational approach by simply being present with people.

Presence is about participating in situations and relationships with the intent of provoking interest in God, spirituality, and the gospel.

Presence evangelism has a lot in common with an incarnational impulse: being with people in tangible ways so they can get an idea of what it would be like to hang out with God and Jesus.

Would evangelism have taken on an opportunistic and sometimes pushy dynamic if it had been informed by the logic of the Incarnation?

What if evangelists enjoyed frequent, close proximity to the people they were trying to evangelize?

Would evangelistic ministry be solely characterized by confrontational encounters if evangelists knew they would see those same people the next week or even the next day?

These two categories of presence and proclamation present a continuum of necessary yet obviously different modes of engagement.

We must make an important qualification about presence evangelism.

Being present with people can nurture an openness to Jesus, but it cannot by itself communicate the particulars of the founding story of Christianity: an incarnated, crucified, risen, and ascended messiah.

Without proclamation, the soil that was cultivated, tilled, and weeded through presence evangelism is left fallow, with no seed to bring forth fruit.21 This is what demarcates an evangelist who engages in presence evangelism from, say, a prophet, who leans toward incarnational forms of ministry.

The difference between the prophet and the evangelist is that the evangelist is not satisfied until the seed of the gospel makes it into the soil and converts are produced.

In fact, evangelists see the sharing of the gospel as a climactic point of the relationship.

Just as the prophetic ministry can be located along continuums of different yet equally legitimate features, the evangelistic ministry also carries an elegant solution 39

## Proclamation within it a degree of complexity that resists a one-dimensional understanding.

These four basic dimensions of evangelistic ministry—process and event, presence and proclamation—come together to demonstrate a variety of vocational dimensions with corresponding evangelistic roles.

This evangelistic matrix shown in Figure 2.2 does not account for the complexity and variety contained within the evangelistic vocation.

It does, however, provide a more complex, varied understanding of what evangelistic ministry can look like and therefore a deeper and wider view as to the nature of the evangelistic calling.

We need presence and proclamation, process and event, and everything in between if we are going to relegitimize this profoundly generative form of ministry.

These four continua, when cross-sectioned with each other, suggest four types of evangelistic people with corresponding approaches to evangelism.

IN VE S TOR S .

The investor sees evangelism as walking with people through the entire process of conversion, from the beginning of their friendship all the way through conversion and beyond.

They gravitate toward a more extended process of exposing people to Jesus.

Their tagline is, “Let’s walk together.” They enter into relationships with people ready to walk with others through all of life’s ups and downs.

Because they are willing to devote lots of their own time, energy, and emotion in other people, they typically go deep with a few people rather than spreading 40 the permanent revolution themselves out with a lot of people.

This kind of evangelism demonstrates facets of the gospel related to faithfulness and sacrificial love.

Evangelists of this type are tempted to think they are not evangelistic because of a focus on the more event-based paradigm of conversion.

Nevertheless, the staple quality of evangelists is their passion to help lost people move closer to Jesus.

Investors do this gradually and methodically through their willingness to pour their life into someone else.

IN V I TERS.

Unlike their more process-oriented counterparts who take a more incremental approach to exposing people to Jesus, inviters woo others to accompany them into strategic environments that allow them greater exposure to Jesus.

Investors are more comfortable mediating the gospel primarily through a relationship.

They are more prone to triangulate the delivery of the gospel by routing it through other people or events.

In this way, inviters are quite catalytic: they bring people and the gospel together by arranging strategic encounters between people and events designed to present the gospel in meaningful ways.

Entreating people to leave their comfort zone and enter into a somewhat foreign environment can be unsettling for most people.

But evangelists are often energized by meeting new people.

It is this quality that makes them so effective in getting people whose social bearings steer them away from new experiences and relationships to literally walk with them into new environments.

They have the unique ability to make the often intimidating experience of being introduced to new people and environments appealing and enjoyable.

Going along with this form of evangelism is the somewhat intuitive ability to soften the potentially abrasive pathway of entering a new group of people.

Inviters specialize in the art of inclusion, making them invaluable to any missional venture.

Because they know how to attract people, they also intuitively know what can potentially repel people.

Two scriptural figures who operated as inviters were Andrew and the women at the well (John 1:40–41; John 4).

They all had a “comeand-see” quality to their evangelistic ministry that brought others into closer proximity to Jesus.

Inviters are especially good at gathering people together for common social activities like meals, parties, recreation, and even community projects and service.

They generate traffic and direct it to social spaces where relationships can be formed.

CONV I NCERS.

Convincers are particularly adept at making persuasive and compelling presentations of the gospel.

They have confidence in an elegant solution 41 the gospel and champion its power to change people.

They believe that exposure to the gospel can, and will, radically transform people.

In contrast to evangelists who gravitate toward more of a style of presence, convincers are less likely to shy away from situations that require explaining and even defending the gospel.

They are energized by the task of persuading and convincing others of their point of view.

They find great satisfaction in debunking false notions of the gospel, effectively removing the cultural stigma that is often attached to Jesus and the church.

Apollos is a good example of someone who was naturally drawn toward proclaiming the gospel in convincing, and even confrontational ways (Acts 18:24–27).22 He refuted people in public debate, convincing various Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah.

On a more persuasive yet less argumentative side of things, Phillip the evangelist serves as a model of a more event-based proclamation style of evangelism.

His time in Samaria and encounter with the Ethiopian Eunuch demonstrate an entrepreneurial, itinerant, compelling, and obviously persuasive kind of evangelistic ministry (Acts 8).

Convincers have a capacity to proclaim the gospel within a limited, focused period of time.

When we use the term event, we are not necessarily referring to a church gathering.

An event is a specific time frame in which the message of the gospel is poured out with dynamic force, prompting a decision to move closer to Jesus.

These moments could be during Bible study, a conversation, a meal, or a random divine appointment where a convincer perceives someone is ready to hear about Jesus.

Convincers’ capacity to deliver the gospel in concise presentations is tied up in their ability to formulize the gospel and package it in ways that hone its accessibility and practicality.

James Choung’s four circles are a good example of how a convincer will compress the meaning and significance of the gospel into metaphors, illustrations, and diagrams that allow people to grasp some of the essential thrust of the gospel and com- municate it in focused, concise ways.23

This tendency of convincers to formulize and effectively codify the gospel often leads them to develop evangelistic training materials.24

CON V ERSERS.

Not everyone is ready to have an intense, concentrated encounter with the gospel.

Some people need to be exposed gradually to the message in ways that allow them to process and internalize its meaning and significance for their lives.

Conversers are especially equipped for this because, like investors, they are more comfortable with helping someone discover the meaning of the gospel in an incremental fashion.

42 the permanent revolution

Conversers are most comfortable talking about Jesus when the dialogue is shaped by the other person’s interests and context.

They are more comfortable with dialogue than monologue, with offering soundbites about Jesus rather than an entire album or Jesus CD.

Conversers are sensitive to the contingencies of people’s lives and feel most natural in sharing the gospel when they are navigating the emergent dynamics of conversation.

They are often good at asking questions and listening, and they prefer to let the needs and interests of the other person decide what particular feature of the gospel they will emphasize or introduce into the conversation.

Their ability to expose people to the gospel incrementally often prolongs the relationship and allows people to learn at their own pace. A biblical example of the converser is Jesus with the women at the well (John 4).

The Evangelist’s Orbit

Although evangelists are usually based in a local community, they also reach out from there into the broader society.

They have more direct social contact with not-yet-Christian people than the other types, except perhaps Pauline-style apostles, a topic we discuss in Chapter Six.

At the very least, the evangelistic engagement is much more deeply personal than that of the apostolic engagement.

The orbit of evangelists is generally in and around a local or regional church, but certainly a case can be made for roving, translocal itinerant evangelists.

Philip, George Whitfield, Charles Finney, and Billy Graham come to mind.

Whatever the range of operation, evangelists have to work with local communities because although they are adept at bringing new people in, they typically struggle to integrate them into the community.

This is partly due to their more theologically and socially outgoing (generative) orientation.

They are not wired for the more integrative functions of the shepherd, whose primary orientation is to foster a sense of community and belonging.

Evangelistic people specialize in recruiting, but they are not designed for retention.

This function falls more to the shepherding vocation.

Shepherd Intelligence: Creating Empathic Community With the rise of the pastoral theology movement in the 1970s, along with millennia-old traditions of practice, perhaps more is understood about the pastoral ministry than all the others.

The only other contender for an elegant solution 43 first place is the teaching ministry.

In the light of this, we will not try to give anything but the most basic of definitions here to be able to explore how the shepherd role relates within the APEST system.

The term shepherd is used throughout the Old Testament to categorize various types of leaders (kings and priests) and, significantly, that of Yahweh himself—he being the Shepherd of Israel.

Along with its metaphorical quality, the concept of shepherd comes to us with a rich interpretive framework that can easily fund the imagination and provoke almost endless analogies and insight about leadership and followership.

The oddity, though, is that while the word poimen (shepherd) is used eighteen times in the New Testament, only once does it describe the ministry function of Christians; rather, it refers mainly to the person and work of Jesus.

Despite this strong restriction of the term, it has pretty much captured our thinking when it comes to church leadership and other organizational arrangements.

This means that contrary to the APE types, which require us to reconstruct a sound comprehension of these ministries, we probably have to do a lot of deconstruction here to arrive at a biblical understanding.

The catch-all nature of the term obscures the central functions of shepherd, especially considered in relation to the other roles.

Formation in Christ: Local and Communal

At its core, the shepherd is tasked with creating a healthy community, with nurturing people in the faith, and caring for the welfare of the people.

Perhaps one of the best ways to articulate the essence of the shepherding function is summed up in the word formation in the way of Christ, lived locally and communally.

This impulse to nurture and protect the community leads us to say that shepherds operate primarily out of a communal impulse.

They are invigorated by a sense of cohesion, inclusiveness, and stability.

In a sense, they are the ecclesial equivalent of an organization’s human resource department.

Shepherds pay close attention to their immediate environment, noticing details about people and the state of the community.

They necessarily have strong empathic aptitudes and heightened capacities for meaningful friendship and relationships.

For instance, drawing on what is called Dunbar’s rule, which states that relational networks are maxed out between 120 and 150 people, Neil Cole says that a pastor’s ministry is likely limited to around 120 people.

To be a good shepherd in any sense of the word, pastors have to know all the names and the stories of the people in their care.25 Although this does not exclude a broader shepherd-of-shepherds (pastor et pastorium) role that allows a larger pastoral 44 the permanent revolution organization, it does highlight that calling oneself a pastor or shepherd yet not knowing the personal details of the people in one’s orbit probably disqualifies one from being a shepherd in any meaningful sense of the term.

This alone should cause concern in the way we tend to use the term.

Because of their great sense of and need for cohesion and unity, shepherds will find it disheartening when people leave the community—for good or not-so-good reasons.

In many ways, this echoes the heart of our Lord when he goes in search of the one (Luke 15:4–5).

People, even (or perhaps especially) the most unlikely, most vulnerable, and most insignificant ones, matter to shepherds.

The dark side of the sense of, and need for, harmony is that shepherds/pastors can often avoid conflict in the name of keeping the peace. (There is a difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking.) They also tend to be passive-aggressive because they are generally expected to be “nice,” civil people.

Hence when this need to impose harmony manifests darkly, it creates a stifling need for conformity with little patience for dissenting voices.

Although this book is largely dedicated to the recovery of the APE, especially the apostolic function, it is not our intention in any way to sideline the two functions of shepherd and teacher.

As far as we are concerned, it is hard to see how a local church can sustain itself without shepherds over the long term.

In fact, without the vital role of shepherds, it is hard to see how to sustain Christian witness at all.

But shepherds who exclude other forms undermine their own capacities in the process.

Therefore, the role must be limited to its biblical proportions lest it overreach itself.

The Missional Shepherd?

We are often asked what the role of the shepherd is in the missional church.

If their ministry is primarily focused on the people of God, do they have a part to play in the broader purposes of the church, especially now that the church in the West is having to be recalibrated along missional lines?

Can there be a missional shepherd/pastor?

The answer has to be a definitive yes.

Not only is the church itself the product of the mission of God, but it can never hope to be the church that Jesus intended if it does not exist to participate in what God is doing in the world.

Therefore, the term missional can be used to describe the faith itself, as in “missional Christianity.” It is an important term that ought to be comprehensively applied.

So, for instance, the function of mission (God’s purposes in the world, especially in and through the church) must determine various an elegant solution 45 forms in which ecclesiology must manifest.

The term missional qualifies the role of the shepherd as much as it qualifies the other APEST functions.

Shepherding, like any other ministry, can never function in isolation or as an end in itself.

It fulfills itself in relation to God’s purposes and by realizing its role within the body of Christ. A shepherd’s role in relation to the flock is to ensure that the sheep are healthy, to be sure, but in the end, health must ultimately be measured in terms of numerical increase. A sheep farmer that does not ensure healthy reproduction of sheep (the natural measure of fruitfulness) will not be long in the business of farming.

Another way is for the shepherd to participate in and through the extension ministries of the other members of the body—particularly those of apostle and evangelist.

Ephesians 4:16 says as much: “From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.” Trying to be all things from within one role is likely to lead to failure in the very task one is actually called to.

Not only is this a recipe for burnout, but it is likely to lead to being unfaithful to what Jesus has determined in the first place: each of us has received our callings “as Christ apportioned it” (Ephesians 4:7), and in Christ’s ecclesia, none is greater than the other.

Overreaching our roles amounts to being untrue to our proper vocation.

That is, once again, a reason to circumscribe the pastoral role to its biblical definitions to make vocational space for the others Jesus has called and gifted.

Teacher Intelligence: Bringing Wisdom and Understanding Much is known about the art of teaching and the role of the educator in the various domains that make up life in the world.

Education is basic to life in the West, and we are indelibly shaped by its power.

In the church, theologians and preachers have long held a privileged status and have a powerful impact on our collective imaginations.

Nevertheless, the historical impact of doctrinal theological controversies throughout our history, along with the countless associated schisms and conflict, is ample evidence that teachers have not always had a good impact on the people of God.

Of course, many have, but we cannot deny that some of the most toxic religion has come from bad teaching and from people who want to engage in mind-control tactics.

Truly does St.

James warn, in no uncertain words, of the power of ideologues to bring demonic destruction in human life (James 3:1–5).

The warnings here should give us a direct clue to the central importance of mediating ideas in the church, as well as a good reason that the teaching ministry needs to be brought into biblical perspective.

We need 46 the permanent revolution to adopt the same deconstructive approach to teachers as we have taken with shepherds if we are to demarcate the role in ways that the Bible itself intends.

At its core, the teaching function is about mediating a particular type of wisdom and understanding nuanced by the biblical worldview.

As teaching expresses itself in church circles, it is about helping people gain insight into how God wants them to see and experience their world.

As such, it is concerned with theological truth and shaping the consciousness of God’s people to be consistent with that truth.

In many ways, teachers are similar to prophets, and apostles, in that they all deal with ideas that shape life.

The difference perhaps is that teachers are concerned more about broad comprehension and systematic understanding as opposed to faithfulness to the covenant (prophets) and the nest of more foundational and formative ideas that apostles hover over with a strong sense of custodial responsibility.

Besides, a sure sign of the difference is that teachers do not have that sense of urgency that instills the apostolic and the prophetic ministries.

Teachers are not concerned with how long learning takes; their main aim is that learners come to a fuller understanding, and that such learning can only be conceived as a lifelong process. (We think that if it were solely up to teachers, the seminary process, now around four years, would likely extend to ten years.)

But because of its primary commitment to ideas, of all the ministries the teacher is probably the most susceptible to being ideological— something that almost always privileges ideas at the expense of people.

In the New Testament, the scribes and pharisees (the resident ideologues in Jesus’s day) come in for some severe criticism. (See, for example, Matthew 15:1–16.)

We believe it is necessary to make a distinction here between the teacher in the more philosophic Hellenistic tradition and in the more existential Hebraic one so that we can understand how to transfer faith in a meaningful, life-oriented way.

For the Hebrews, and by extension the Bible itself, ideas are not important in themselves.

Hebraic sensibilities do not allow for mere speculation on ideas divorced from life and ethics; it is impossible to find any such speculation on the nature of being (ontology) in all the scriptures.

The teaching ministry as the Bible intends it is more inclined to be oriented toward life and obedience than toward ideas divorced from life and context.

For instance, endless discourse on why “kingdom of heaven” is used in Matthew and “kingdom of God” in the other gospels may be intellectually stimulating, but if it does not lead us to be more open to an elegant solution 47 the rule of God in our contexts, we cannot really say we stand-under (understand) the text.

For biblical teachers, their lives are to be their primary messages, and they speak with the authority of people who can live what they speak; these are the true rabbis.

Teaching is not about speculation of ideas in themselves (idealism); rather, it is about the ministry of ideas in action (ethos), that is, discipleship or formation.

We cannot teach what we do not know, and we cannot lead where we will not go.

Therefore, biblical teachers must have real participation in the ideas they propose.

If this is true (and from a biblical perspective, we believe that arguing against it is hard), then it should raise significant questions about the legitimacy of what goes by the name of the teaching ministry in our churches.

This is not to deny a need for serious scholars to engage the deeply philosophical issues of our day or to maintain the primacy of the pulpit.

But to make speculative capacities the standard form of theological reflection, as well as an immutable basis for ministry, moves us away from discipleship to ideology and can account for our nearly systematic failure to produce disciples in Western churches.

As Dallas Willard says, we are educated way beyond our own capacity to obey.26 The Celtic movement, started by Patrick, Columbanus, Aiden, and others, combined mission, learning, and discipleship in a profoundly biblical way is rightly credited with “saving civilization,” evangelizing Europe, and founding liberal arts education rooted in the Hebraic worldview.27

All this has significant implications for our methods of formation—our pedagogy.

Methods matter.

We are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving—the fruit of the tree speaks volumes about the nature of the tree itself.

If we remove action from the equation of learning, we end up with an academic understanding of the faith and little by way of genuine discipleship.

And if the people teaching cannot actually do what they are requiring of others, they will exacerbate the problem.

We have been somewhat critical here because once again, we believe that theologians have pretty much monopolized how we have defined ministry and think about God and faith, and we believe that this accounts for many of the problems the church in the West now faces: immaturity and trended decline.

We suggest that the current arrangement that champions the didactic role at the expense of the other ministries needs to experience a decentering, with a subsequent recentering around the other life-giving vocations in the APEST typology.

Teaching is indispensable to the health of the community, but contrary to what is happening today, the teacher should not be the axis around which the community revolves.

48 the permanent revolution

Jesus never intended it to be so dominant in the mix—a fact attested to its being mentioned last in Ephesians 4:11.

We need vibrant and engaging teaching that should be resituated within a field of practice and with a keener concern to training in context.

Mastery is bound up not in those who can expound ideas but in reflective practitioners who engage in their disciplines accompanied with guided reflection.

Perhaps one of the critical roles of teachers in a missional community is to provide the environments and processes for this reflection to take place.

For instance, Forge Mission Training Network, the missional movement started by Alan and others in Australia, is built squarely on these principles—in context, action reflection, and led by practitionerteachers, for example.28 Ideas come alive when put into practice.

The Genius of the Church Having given some definition to the various APEST ministries and aptitudes, we can now see the spiritual power of these as they are brought together to create a corporate intelligence in the church. (See Table 2.1 at the end of this chapter.)

Looking at the various forms of APEST intelligences as a whole and in systemic relation to each other makes it possible to see the importance of having them all in the ministry mix.

It is hard to see how we could possibly survive, let alone thrive, without a fivefold APEST ministry.

In fact, serious dysfunction will inevitably occur when one form of ministry becomes hegemonic.

Partly this is because one form cannot possibly represent the whole ministry of Christ in the world, but partly because there will be no balancing in the leadership equation, and all the dysfunctions will come to the fore.

For example, when one form of APEST leadership is dislocated from the others, it will tend to monopolize the culture and have a negative effect in the long run.

The one-leader type of church is most at risk in this case, but we can recall organizations that demonstrate the truth of this—for instance:

A/PEST: If an apostolic leader dominates, the church or other organization will tend to be hard-driving, autocratic, with lots of pressure for change and development, and will leave lots of wounded people in its wake.

It is not sustainable and will tend to dissolve with time.

P/AEST: If the prophetic leaders dominates, the organization will be one-dimensional (always harking back to one or two issues), will likely be factious and sectarian, will have a “superspiritual” vibe, or, somewhat paradoxically, will tend to be either too activist to be an elegant solution 49 sustainable or too quietist to be useful.

This is not a viable form of organization.

E/APST: When an evangelistic leader dominates, the organization will have an obsession with numerical growth, will create dependence on effervescent charismatic leadership, and will tend to lack theological breadth and depth.

This type of organization will not empower many people.

S/APET: When pastoral leadership monopolizes, the church or other organization will tend to be risk averse, codependent and needy, and overly lacking in healthy dissent and therefore creativity.

Such an organization will lack innovation and generativity and will not be able to be transfer its core message and tasks from one generation to the next.

T/APES: When teachers and theologians rule, the church will be ideological, controlling, moralistic, and somewhat uptight. A rationalistic, doctrine-obsessed, Christian gnosticism (the idea that we are saved by what we know) will tend to replaces reliance on the Holy Spirit.

These types of organization will be exclusive based on ideology like that of the pharisees.

Once again, it might be useful to use more creational, nonecclesiastical terms to reconsider the power of an integrated, multidimensional leadership team (Figure 2.3).

Any organization that is able to bring together, encourage, and capture the energies of a team comprising all the intelligences will succeed in whatever it is seeking to achieve.

If this is true for the secular world, it is even truer for the church.

Each of the APEST vocations adds a necessary ingredient to the overall missional fitness and maturity of the church, but each needs to be informed and shaped by the others in order to anchor the church in the fullness of Christ’s nature and mission.

In many ways, we are talking about a theological and practical reality found in two biblical metaphors.

The theological reality is that the bride of Christ is called to be holy and pure, and this bride must be ready, complete, pristine, and unsullied.

The second metaphor is that of the body of Christ.

The church is the manifestation of Jesus, allowing the world to see who Jesus was and how he functioned when we have all parts of the body working together.

However, for far too long, the church has been offering an incomplete picture of who Jesus is because the picture has become so weighted to teachers and shepherds.

By exiling APEs within this metaphor, we are jettisoning Jesus from our midst and all the things that Jesus was able to do in those APE ministries.

Can you imagine Jesus not pioneering new frontiers and innovating new ways of being on mission together?

Can you imagine him not speaking truth to power or questioning the religious status quo?

Can you imagine him not calling new people into the kingdom?

Yet those elements are largely missing from churches’ understandings and practices of ministry in the body of Christ.

It’s about holiness and purity.

It’s about presence and functioning as Jesus functioned.

It’s about being who God created us to be as both his body and bride. c02.indd 51 Core vocation

Man is not a mere individual but is his community.

The man in Christ is ontologically bound to the ecclesial reality.

Fear of difference is fear of life itself.

It is possible to conceive of conflict as not necessarily a wasteful outbreak of incompatibilities but a normal process by which socially valuable differences register themselves for the enrichment of all.
