# Mapping the Contours of Apostolic Ministry

> "The great Christian revolutions came not by the discovery of something that was not known before.

> They happen when someone takes radically something that was always there."
>
> —H. Richard Niebuhr

> "One aim of missiology is a more adequate understanding of the apostolic task of the Church.

> There is no other way to retain continuity with the apostles than to keep on doing what they did."
>
> —Carl E. Braaten

> "This Life’s dim windows of the soul 
> Distorts the heavens from pole to pole 
> And leads you to believe a lie
> When you see with, not thro' the eye."
>
> —William Blake, *The Everlasting Gospel*

William Blake reminds us that truly understanding a movement requires openness to its "otherness." Advances in both science and theology depend on such openness—on revelation and radical seeing, especially at the core of ecclesial codes such as the apostolic.

### Key Questions

- Is contemporary apostolic vocation the same as that of Paul and the twelve, or is it different?
- What are the functions, qualifications, and roles of contemporary apostles?
- What are the implications for leadership, ministry, and organizational structure?

---

## Little "a" and Big "A" Apostles

Skeptics fear that contemporary apostles might replace or overshadow the original twelve.

The reality, however, is clear: **The original twelve played a unique, foundational role, but ongoing apostolic functions have continued throughout church history.**

Every role in the APEST model draws from its biblical archetype. "Little 'a'" apostles (beyond the twelve) and other roles, like shepherds and teachers, should maintain continuity with scriptural precedents.

The assumption that the apostles’ primary role was to write the Bible is incorrect.

The apostles were more than scribes—they were custodians, planters, networkers, and foundational leaders.

---

## Gifted and Empowered

Apostolic ministry is not merely a personality type or entrepreneurial gift; it is described in the New Testament as both a spiritual gift (charismata) and a vocation (kleseos).

Apostolic ministry—like all Christian ministry—is fundamentally charismatic, flowing from the gifting of the Holy Spirit to all believers.

- **Apostolic succession** (as traditionally understood) is critiqued as it institutionalizes what should remain charismatic and Spirit-led.

Throughout this text, "apostle" is used more as a function and vocation—not as an institutional office.

Apostolic calling, like other ministries, is recognized by the community and originates from the Spirit.

---

## Paul as Prototype

Paul’s letters, especially 1 and 2 Corinthians, offer metaphors that define apostolic ministry:
- **Planter:** Seeding the gospel in new contexts (1 Corinthians 3:6–8)
- **Architect:** Master builder and blueprint crafter, involved in both design and implementation (1 Corinthians 3:10)
- **Foundation Layer:** Lays a secure base for communities (1 Corinthians 3:10–15)
- **Father:** Spiritually nurtures and intervenes for his churches (1 Corinthians 4:14–21; 2 Corinthians)
- **Ambassador:** Represents the interests of the kingdom (2 Corinthians 5:16–21)

Other metaphors—custodian, partner, coworker, slave, aroma of Christ—enrich our understanding.

Ultimately, the apostolic task is always missionary, aligning the church with the missio Dei (God’s sending mission).

---

## The Custodian of the Gospel

Paul describes himself as a "steward of the gospel" (oikonomia), responsible for:
- Safeguarding the value and integrity of the gospel within the church (1 Corinthians 4:1–2; Ephesians 3:2)
- Ensuring that the gospel is authentically transmitted and contextualized across cultures

> "Nothing is more closely associated with the 'apostle' than the 'gospel.' No apostle can separate his or her calling as apostle from their core purpose—to serve the gospel."
>
> —John Schutz

This custodianship is not exclusive ownership but responsible stewardship.

### Core Functions of Apostolic Ministry

Literature on apostles (e.g., Mike Breen, David Cannistraci) lists diverse functions, such as:
- Pioneering and planting churches
- Overseeing and strengthening communities
- Developing leaders and ordaining ministries
- Imparting doctrine and maintaining theological integrity
- Networking and managing ministries

Apostolic ministry is best understood as a system in which all these functions combine synergistically.

---

## The Four Interrelated Functions of Apostolic Ministry

1. **Seeding the DNA of the Gospel and the Church by Pioneering New Ground** Apostles are pioneers who carry the core "DNA" of the Christian movement into new contexts, planting and cultivating diverse expressions of ecclesia. 2. **Guarding the DNA of the Gospel and Ecclesia** Apostles guard against mutations that threaten the integrity of the faith, addressing heresy and error, and maintaining faithful templates of ecclesia.

3. **Networking the Movement** Apostolic ministry fosters interconnected movements—distributed, not centralized—held together by vision, purpose, and a "web of meaning" rooted in the gospel.

4. **Creating the Environment for Other Ministries** Apostolic leaders create contexts in which prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching gifts emerge and flourish.

Their catalytic role is foundational but not hierarchical.

---

## The Consequences of Excluding Apostolic Ministry

Excluding the apostolic function creates significant deficits:

- Without apostolic multiplication, growth remains additive and individualistic.
- Without apostolic action, the promised presence and authority of Christ is diminished.
- Without apostolic clarity, purpose and identity become murky.
- Without apostolic modeling, a culture of release and empowerment is lost, replaced with management and control.
- Without apostolic parenting, mentoring and leadership development falter.
- Without apostolic accountability, strategic questions are neglected.
- Without apostolic imagination, issues of scalability and reproducibility are not addressed.
- Without apostolic passion, the church becomes focused on survival rather than participating in global mission.

---

## Summary

The apostolic ministry serves as both the catalyst and environment for all other APEST functions, ensuring the church remains a generative, multiplying, and missional movement rather than a static institution.

> "The custodian both seeds and guards the theo-genetic codes of the church, and this helps generate and sustain movements as well as catalyze the incredible potential locked up in the ministry of Jesus’s church."

## Epilogue and Transition

> "In the coming world, God will not ask me: 'W hy were you not Moses?' Instead he will ask me: 'W hy were you not Zusya?'"

> —Rabbi Zusya

As we proceed, we will analyze the nuances of apostolic ministry and individual vocation, recognizing that personal history and divine calling together shape the impact and expression of each ministry.

## Apostolic Ministry: Understanding Pauline and Petrine Models

> "The Church must be forever building, and always decaying, and always being restored."
>
> —T. S. Eliot

Apostolic ministry, as observed in the New Testament and throughout the history of the church, is a dynamic and multifaceted function.

Building on the insights of Dick Scoggins, this chapter explores the distinction between two significant paradigms: the Pauline and Petrine models of apostleship.

This distinction has profound implications for the ways apostles conceive of themselves and fulfill their callings, especially in varying contexts.

## The Emergence of the Pauline–Petrine Distinction

We are indebted to Dick Scoggins for highlighting the functional difference between these two models of apostleship.

Scoggins, who serves at the U.S.

Center for World Missions and has extensive missionary experience among Muslim peoples in North Africa, noticed a significant shift in apostolic function when he transitioned from a pioneering context in Africa to engaging established Christian groups in Europe.

Turning to Scripture for clarity, Scoggins found insight in **Galatians 2:8–10**.

In this passage, Paul explains how the apostolic council recognized the distinct callings: he and Barnabas as apostles to the Gentiles, and Peter (along with James and John) as apostles to Israel and the Jewish diaspora.

Scoggins observes:

> “So we see that there is an apostolic ministry to the unreached (the Pauline), but there is also an apostolic ministry to the existing people of God (the Petrine).

For me the clincher was that Jesus is ... the forerunner of both (Hebrews 3:1), but the bulk of His apostleship was to Israel.”

He concludes that while the model of apostleship is typically patterned after Paul the pioneer, much of the New Testament is actually concerned with achieving Petrine outcomes: reform, renewal, and revitalization of the existing church.

## Pauline and Petrine Apostolic Ministries

### Overlapping Functions

Apostolic ministry is never one-dimensional.

It is nuanced by calling, personality, APEST profile, culture, context, and relationships.

The distinction between Pauline and Petrine is an additional variable to consider.

Not unlike the difference between being right-handed and left-handed, both share core functions — **custodian, guardian, networker, and translocal activity** — but exhibit unique strengths.

### Key Differences

- **Pauline Apostles** extend and establish Christianity on new ground, typically through pioneering, cross-cultural, and entrepreneurial methods.
- **Petrine Apostles** help reframe and revitalize the identity and mission of the existing church, primarily through innovative, reformational, and intracultural approaches.

---

## The Pauline Model: Cross-Cultural Pioneer Founder

Pauline apostles are called to pioneer among unreached peoples.

Their ministry is characterized by movement, spiritual restlessness, and a passion for breaking new ground.

**Characteristics of the Pauline Model:**
- Extends the mission of the church: exploratory, founding, cross-cultural, entrepreneurial.
- Functions: custodian, networker, architect, guardian, translocal, meaning manager.
- Resists institutional constraints, thrives on the frontiers, and sustains commitment through union with Christ and the missio Dei.
- Produces profound theology rooted in experience and mission.
- Historical examples: St.

Patrick’s missions to Ireland, the Celtic movement, and figures like Hudson Taylor and Roland Allen.

---

## The Petrine Model: Intracultural Visionary Architect

Petrine apostles focus more on the existing people of God, mobilizing and remissionalizing the established church.

**Characteristics of the Petrine Model:**
- Reframes the church’s identity and mission: refounding, intracultural, intrapreneurial.
- Rooted in missional discipleship, the Petrine apostle is tasked with feeding, equipping, and mobilizing the church to fulfill its vocation.
- Acts as a steward and custodian of organizational culture, unlocking ecclesial potential by drawing from internal resources.
- Works akin to a “tempered radical”—balancing conformity and revolution for ongoing change.
- More at ease with tradition and institutional frameworks, facilitating renewal from within.

### Modern Examples

- **Petrine Type:** Reggie McNeal, Tim Keller, Felicity Dale, Alan Roxburgh.
- **Pauline Type:** Neil Cole, Dave Ferguson, Ralph Moore, Erwin McManus.

## Pioneers, Miners, Networkers, and Mobilizers

Based on the Pauline–Petrine distinction and the explorer/catalyst dynamic, apostolic types can be further categorized:

| Type | Model | Orientation | Function | |-------------|----------|------------------|---------------| | Pioneer | Pauline | Explorer | Cross-cultural risk-taker, church planter, boundary-crosser | | Miner | Petrine | Explorer | Uncovers and activates internal resources, addresses deep structures | | Networker | Pauline | Catalyst | Connects and broadens movements across regions; maintains translocal ties | | Mobilizer | Petrine | Catalyst | Operationalizes mission, refounds and remissionalizes established communities |

---

### Explorers: Movement Momentum

Both pioneers (Pauline) and miners (Petrine) are essential for maintaining and cultivating momentum within apostolic movements.

Edgar Schein’s three levels of organizational culture — **the tangible, the theory, the thought world** — underscore how lasting change involves addressing deep assumptions and core narratives.

---

### Catalysts: Movements and Innovation

**Pauline Catalyst (Networker):**
- Establishes and sustains networks for the spread of the gospel.
- Functions translocally to plant, connect, and resource churches.

**Petrine Catalyst (Mobilizer):**
- Accelerates mobilization by rearticulating core theological truths.
- Helps the church become more creative, focused, and missional from within.
- Demonstrates relational, political, and organizational intelligence.

---

## Leadership Types and Apostolic Mix: APEST Correlations

Personality traits and the APEST fivefold ministry (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) influence apostolic leanings:

- **Pioneer:** Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist
- **Networker:** Apostle, Evangelist, Shepherd
- **Miner:** Apostle, Teacher, Prophet
- **Mobilizer:** Apostle, Shepherd, Evangelist

These roles are not rigid categories — most apostolic leaders function across all four, though with varying levels of intensity and effectiveness.
