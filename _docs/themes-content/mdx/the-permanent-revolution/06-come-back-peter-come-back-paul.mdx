# Living from the Center: Apostolic Ministry and the Renewal of Christianity

> "To encounter God is to change.

> The Church must be forever building, and always decaying, and always being restored."
>
> —T.S. Eliot

Scripture is replete with cycles of renewal, both corporate and personal.

Without ongoing renewal, movements decline and die.

Apostolic leaders often spur such renewal, especially during pivotal cultural transitions, such as the Celtic missions after the fall of Rome.

### Organizational Life Cycles and Leadership

Movements progress through identifiable stages, each requiring corresponding leadership:

1. **Courtship:** Formation 2. **Infancy:** Launch 3. **Go-go:** Rapid growth 4. **Adolescence:** Early establishment 5. **Prime:** Peak vitality 6. **Stability:** Plateauing 7. **Aristocracy:** Complacency 8. **Recrimination:** Internal questioning 9. **Bureaucracy:** Inward focus, decline 10. **Death:** Closure or absorption

**Key Leadership Roles (adapted from Lawrence Miller):**

- Prophet: Visionary initiator
- Barbarian: Leader through crisis/conquest
- Builder/Explorer: Developer of systems and skills
- Synergist: Maintains balance, unites diverse roles
- Administrator: Focuses on structure and security
- Bureaucrat: Imposes control, inhibits innovation
- Aristocrat: Detached, triggers disintegration

**APEST Correlations:**
- Early stages: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists
- Peak and sustainability: Shepherds, Teachers
- Renewal and transformation: Petrine (synergists), with Pauline forms as initiators

## Center and Borderlands: The Cycle of Renewal

Renewal is dialectical—a dynamic movement between the spiritual center (deep encounter with God) and the borderlands (engagement with the world).

Apostolic ministry operates at both:

- **Custodian:** Retains the living connection with God and gospel.
- **Frontier Agent:** Extends the mission of the church to new territory.

Apostolic leaders facilitate the church's return to its foundational calling, ensuring authenticity, vitality, and ongoing relevance.

## The Petrine Priority: Refounding and Revitalizing

Petrine apostles, through refounding, lead established communities to rediscover their original purpose and message.

This process empowers and releases Pauline forms, resulting in a synergistic apostolic impact across the church.

> "The apostolic role within established churches and denominations requires reinterpreting the denomination’s foundational values in the light of the demands of its mission today...

> The ultimate goal of these apostolic leaders is to call the denomination away from maintenance, back to mission."
>
> —Steve Addison

**Examples of Petrine Renewal:**
- Pastoral Leadership Institute (PLi) in the Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod)
- FiveTwo Wiki—church planting and leadership development network

## Conclusion: The Mission Has a Church

The ongoing renewal of Christianity is tied to the health and presence of apostolic ministry in its Pauline and Petrine expressions.

Apostolic ministry is not just about starting new movements but also about continually reforming, reviving, and propelling the church toward its missional calling.

Without these functions, the ministry mix of the church is impoverished, and its ability to thrive diminishes.

---

## The Nature of Mission and Renewal

> "It is not so much that the church has a mission but that the mission has a church."

To define Christian mission purely on human terms is theologically inaccurate and misunderstands its nature: mission is rooted in the being and purposes of God.

As God's people, our task is to discern what God is doing and to join Him.

This perspective shifts the focus from the Church crafting its own mission, to understanding that the mission of God precedes and empowers the Church itself.

## Rediscovering the Primal Purpose

Being the Church that Jesus intended involves participating in God’s eternal purposes for the world.

Renewal is more than merely reinventing ourselves; it is about rediscovering the primal power of the Spirit and the gospel already present in the Church’s life—reconnecting with our purpose and recovering forgotten ways.

This potential has always existed but has often been overshadowed by layers of tradition, ritual, dogma, and worldliness.

Robert Quinn refers to the rediscovery of our foundational scripts as “discerning the inner voice of the organization,” describing this inner voice as the organization’s moral center.

He asserts:

> "[The] articulation of the inner voice of an organization is often the first step toward revitalizing [an organization] and uncovering a vision filled with resonance."

Rather than concocting a mission from scratch, we must listen again to the Church's inner voice, reconnect with our defining scripts, and re-engage with our deepest sense of meaning.

## Petrine Apostleship and Organizational Renewal

Petrine approaches to renewal do not impose a new purpose on their members; instead, they help them rediscover their purpose and train them to listen for the organization’s inner voice.

While realigning with this inner voice may threaten the institution’s status quo—often built on self-preservation—it is essential for the ongoing vitality and legitimacy of the Christian movement.

Lawrence Cada, in his study of religious orders, describes the “founding charism” as an order’s unique, gospel-transformed vision of the world.

The use of charism (grace) highlights that an organization's purpose is fundamentally a gift—a divine bequest unique to each organization.

Recovering this gift means a "return to the sources." Apostolic refounding, therefore, is fundamentally about this return.

Organizational renewal is the process of discovering an organization’s true identity and mission.

The authority for transformation comes not from leaders or groups, but from God’s calling.

The key to revitalizing religious organizations is to recover and reappropriate their founding charism.

Dallas Willard encourages younger leaders to:

> "Stir the primal coals of your movement, do what they did, say what they said."

This is a call to be radical traditionalists—not as a blind return to conventionality, but as an innovative reinterpretation of the founding charism for contemporary expression.

### Radical Traditionalism: Continuity and Innovation

Consider Volkswagen’s reinvention of the Beetle or the Mini: while these vehicles retain continuity with their origins, they are also radically new.

This kind of radical traditionalism is also seen in religious renewal movements—such as the return to Wesleyan roots in Methodism or the charismatic renewal within mainline denominations in the 1980s.

All apostolic ministry involves this return to the founding message, reinterpreted into new contexts.

Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, in their work on organizational dynamics, advise us to:

> "Preserve the core and stimulate progress."

Revitalization requires both continuity and discontinuity—a conservative dimension and a radical one.

Radical traditionalism involves rediscovering the founder’s vision and matching it with innovation.

## Renewal with a Long Tail

Both Pauline founding and Petrine refounding require crafting and living into new organizational practices and rhythms anchored in foundational principles:

- Recentering the Church on its Christological roots
- Developing robust discipleship processes
- Creating leadership development pathways
- Forging new approaches to mission
- Shaping organizational structure for purpose-fit
- Overcoming risk aversion

Because apostolic work is foundational, its most important results often lie beneath the surface, sometimes unnoticeable for long periods.

Many fail at this stage not due to a lack of ideas or resources, but due to a lack of perseverance and courage.

### The “Flywheel Effect”

Jim Collins describes organizational progress as a “flywheel effect”:

> "In building a great organization, there is no single defining action...

Rather, it feels like turning a giant, heavy flywheel.

Pushing with great effort—days, weeks and months of work, with almost imperceptible progress—you finally get the flywheel to inch forward.

Each turn builds upon previous work, compounding your investment of effort.

This is how you build greatness."

Apparent successes tend to have a long, unspectacular prehistory.

For example, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese church after the Maoist revolution was built on foundational, apostolic groundwork laid generations before.

### Laying Deep Foundations

This “long tail” echoes Jesus’s teachings on the kingdom’s slow, subversive growth: seeds becoming trees, yeast leavening dough.

Initial insignificance—seen in Christ’s own ministry—may give way to great long-term impact.

Patient trust in core ideas (the “DNA”) is paramount.

## Adventures in the Borderlands

Renewal is inherently dialogical, requiring both:

1.

Reconnection with central, founding ideas 2.

Engagement at the organizational “edges”

The revitalizing move outward—into unknown territory—is essential.

Renewal often emerges through “surfing the edge of chaos,” a concept from living systems theory.

Engagement with the world forces the Church to interpret and translate its message, catalyzing theological and spiritual renewal driven from the margins.

> "The main stimulus for the renewal of Christianity will come from the bottom and from the edge, from sectors of the Christian world that are on the margins."
>
> —W. C. Roof

Historically, movements of mission outside the Church have generated inner renewal.

Systemic renewal seldom comes from disengagement or insularity.

### The Edge as the Site of Innovation

Without borderland engagement, organizations become self-reinforcing and resistant to change.

Intelligence and decision-making are derived solely from inherited traditions, which eventually become sacrosanct and disconnected from present realities.

Real learning and renewal arise from a dialectic engagement—struggles at the edge, where new problems invite innovative solutions.

Donald Schön notes:

> "There are those who choose the swampy lowlands.

They deliberately involve themselves in messy but crucially important problems and, when asked to describe their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition and muddling through."

Reflective practitioners who can translate hard-won, edge-derived wisdom into organizational learning are invaluable.

## Drawing Near to God, Taking It to the Streets

Apostolic ministry mediates the vital dialectic of renewal: as “classic edge people,” apostles extend Christianity into new situations, ensuring that the gospel DNA is faithfully transmitted across contexts.

As guardians of the DNA, they safeguard foundational truths, recognizing that error at this level mutates all that follows.

> "Preserve the core and stimulate progress."
>
> —Collins & Porras

Apostolic ministry is necessary not only for expanding the church’s reach but also for maintaining the health of its home base.

Founding any movement in a fallen world inevitably requires refounding.
