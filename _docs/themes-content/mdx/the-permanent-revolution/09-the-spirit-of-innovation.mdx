# The Spirit of Innovation

His work may have been fiction, but it spoke directly to the swelling tensions of the day. We think the apostolic organizations—movements—speak in much the same way to the issues of our day.

God is always on the move, and he intends to take us on the journey with him.

One gets the feeling from reading church historian Kenneth Scott Latourette that the history of the church is the history of God’s relentless mission to redeem the world and that apostolic movements arise when God, impatient and inexorable in his love, extends the reach of his kingdom through people willing to follow the missio Dei to wherever he leads.1 Movements happen when the church manages to shake off its collective fears and plunges into the mission of God in the world, where, while experiencing risk and disorientation, they also get to encounter God and each other in a new way.

We recently came across a cartoon that represented a peasant, cap in hand, appealing for help before a king sitting on a throne.

The king is depicted as saying, “I can’t solve your problem. I am your problem.” This seems to convey pretty well the nature of the issue faced when dealing with the existing situation.

Such a view of the church will invariably reframe the way we normally conceive of and subsequently structure the various organizations we inhabit.

If we think that the primary purpose of the church is to sustain a common liturgical life, offer pastoral care, and deliver teaching and that the mission of the church is secondary to these purposes (as is the commonly held view), then these functions set the agenda for how we organize ourselves.

The net result is that we end up with an organization that deliberately prioritizes these more internally focused, service-oriented agendas and outcomes.

The reality is that all organization involves the mobilization of bias; organizations embed a predisposition, a certain bent, into the social life of the community.

It is because of this that in some deeply inexorable sense, we get in the end what we wanted even though it might not be all that God intended.

The disturbing problem is that organizational bias is often at direct odds with the implicit motivations, as well as explicit purposes, of the God revealed in our Lord, Jesus Christ.

By extension, the church that takes God’s mission as its organizing principle will be biased, that is, structurally predisposed, in favor of achieving that mission.

The result is that it will inevitably look and feel different from the way we have historically tended to see the church in the West.2 movements r us 207 Mission as Organizing Principle Political scientist Elmer Schattschneider first defined organization as the mobilization of bias.3 What he meant is that we humans tend to organize ourselves in ways that help us actualize our latent or expressed values, interests, and aspirations.

If this is true, then whether mission is at the forefront of our organization will be most clearly demonstrated in the way in which we organize ourselves.

If mission is patently lacking in terms of outcome, then clearly we do not value it enough for it to inform our organizational bias.

There is no way to evade this reality.

As should be amply clear by now, when we talk about an apostolic church we are in effect calling the church to be a missional church, that is, a church that allows its missiology to determine and guide in the formation and understanding of its ecclesiology.

In saying this, we are also implying that the church’s purpose and context will guide the cultural forms and expressions of the church in any given setting.

In The Forgotten Ways, I (Alan) say it this way: “When the church is in mission, it is the true church.

The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible.

The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus.

To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people.”4 If evangelizing and discipling the nations lie at the heart of the church’s purpose in the world, then it is mission, and not ministry (to one another), that constitutes the true organizing principle of the church.

In other words, the various functions of the church are best catalyzed by the missional one: “Experience tells us that a church that aims at ministry seldom gets to mission even if it sincerely intends to do so.

But the church that aims at mission will have to do ministry, because ministry is the means to do mission.”5 When mission becomes the organizing principle of the church, it necessarily calls into question the prevailing forms and structures of our organizations.

If we are honest, most of our organizations, while they may have initially started out as movements or support structures for mission, over time drift into a more ministry-oriented mode of existence.

In pursuing an apostolic mode of organization, we are simply trying to put mission back into the basic equation of the church.

If organization is the mobilization of bias, then apostolic organization is the mobilization of apostolic, or missional, bias.

And the net result will be apostolic movement.

This chapter explores the nature of movements and how to organize and lead them. 208 the permanent revolution Power to the People Again Movements are the quintessentially apostolic, missionally biased form of the church.

Given that most movements start with grassroots missional engagement in a context generally far from the cultural epicenter of the established church, this statement ought not to be surprising.

In fact, just about every Christian organization today started as a people movement of sorts.

For instance, most of the orders, renewal movements, parachurch agencies, overseas mission organizations, and church planting movements started as movements.

Even the origins of all the Protestant denominations (except perhaps the Anglican, unless one considers the demands of King Henry VIII for a divorce as starting a movement) fit this category.

But the idea of organizing around movement need not simply apply to the beginning phases, as if it were some kind of preliminary scaffolding that ought to be dismantled as the church matures naturally into more institutional forms.

Rather, if we believe that the church is in essence apostolic, then it ought always to retain and engender organizational forms that align with its missional purpose.

Ecclesia ought always to be movemental to some degree, or it ceases to be the church that Jesus intended it to be.6 For more established institutional churches, becoming more movemental provides them with a way forward—a kind of back-to-the future approach to organizational development.

It will mean recovering that which they have lost, like finding lost treasures in the church’s historical basement (or attic) where it has laid hidden, misplaced, or forgotten.

Movement, and the possibility of it, is written into the genetic codes of the church.

We have already observed that inserting apostolic bias into a plateauing or declining organization brings with it the possibility of sigmoid growth and renewal.

If leaders continue following the logic implied in the apostolic approach, wholesale renewal will take place.

Where apostolic imagination and influence are maintained throughout the life of an organization, they bring with them the kind of self-understanding that allows an organization to retain fluid and adaptive forms that allow movement to take place.

For instance, a major Pentecostal denomination in Australia has maintained sigmoid growth over the long term, whereas the original denomination in the United States has been experiencing significant decline.

They are the same in almost every way; the only significant difference between them is that the Australian wing has managed to maintain a sustained commitment to apostolic (and, by extension, movements r us 209 APEST) ministry.

In the U.S. expression, the language of fivefold has largely fallen into disuse because of a history of various disputes about power and roles.

An apostolic approach to organization will ensure that churches and organizations are inherently adaptive, flexible, self-renewing, resilient, learning, and intelligent.

An apostolic movement takes its cue from the biblical teachings about the church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:12–16), the living temple (1 Peter 2:4–5), the ecclesia as movement, as well as Jesus’s teachings about the organic nature of the kingdom of God.

We must allow these metaphors and ideas to reframe the way we see God’s people as a movement.

Taken together, they provide powerful, theologically substantial pathways to reimagine organization from an apostolic perspective.

Our hope in the West lies in the recovery of a more fluid and dynamic apostolic imagination and practice.

We have to be vigorous in recovering this understanding because the prevailing forms of organization dominate the way we think about church and organization.

Apostolic movements require that we see church beyond its more institutional forms—as a movement of the whole people of God active in every sphere and domain of society.

Seen through the lens of institution, the church will be conceived of as being primarily made up of its external forms and not its inner nature—as being made up of the combination of theological preferences, professional clergy, elaborate rituals, denominational templates, distinctive buildings, and the like.

Clearly this is not what the New Testament itself means by ecclesia, and although it can be included within more movemental understandings, it is not what we mean by apostolic movement.

We need a new influx of apostolic imagination to dislodge the hierarchical, machine-like metaphor that imbues our more inherited ecclesiologies and that has so captured our imagination.

We have to think differently about how we conceive of ourselves if we are to see different results.

The conventional way of thinking views the church as solid and static, the other as more fluid and dynamic.

When we allow the apostolic, movemental way of thinking to reshape our idea of church, we begin to see the sheer transformational power of the church that Jesus designed—a church where each part in the system, be it individual disciple or community, has the full potential of the whole and therefore is intrinsically empowered to achieve what Jesus has set out for us to achieve.

We begin to realize that, at least potentially, every believer ought to be considered a church planter and every church should be thought of as a church-planting church.

Just as there is the full 210 the permanent revolution potential of a forest in every seed, so too is the task of leadership to help every disciple to be a movement in the making.

In Jesus’s kingdom, everyone gets to play—even hookers, dodgy businessmen, and political insurgents—hardly what we would normally consider to be the A-Team, the cream of the leadership crop.

Therefore, anything blocking the God-given agency of each disciple must ultimately derive from the Evil One.

When we think this way, then we are thinking movementally, that is, apostolically.

Conversely, if we are not thinking about ecclesia in this way, we are not seeing the church as the New Testament itself intends us to see it.

In light of this, apostolic leadership recognizes that every member or group in a movement already has everything it needs to get the job done.

They just need permission and empowerment to live into that truth.

Rather than attributing more and more power to an increasingly centralized (centripetal) organization, movement dynamics require that power and function flow away from the center to the outermost limits, giving the whole movement a profoundly centrifugal feel.

As Darin Land observes in his book The Diffusion of Ecclesiastical Authority, the leaders in the book of Acts took this very approach: “By consistently sharing their authority with others, these leaders allowed the diffusion of authority to new individuals rather than the concentration of authority in the hands of the few They were able to do this because their authority was based on deference and mutual honor, not only on legal rights.

Thus, the diffusion of ecclesiastical authority resulted in a net increase of authority, which in turn propelled the growth of the church.”7 This is the very stuff of movements, and it is also underscored in current best-thinking books on organizations, including Peter Senge’s The Fifth Discipline, Dee Hock’s Birth of the Chaordic Age, Steve Addison’s Movements That Change the World, Bob Roberts’s Glocalization, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom’s The Starfish and the Spider, Clay Shirky’s Here Comes Everybody, and Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams’s Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything.8 So let’s delve a bit further into movements, the most primal form of ecclesia.

Andrew Jones, who blogs under the name of Tall Skinny Kiwi, did research to assess whether the current missional movement fits the characteristics of being a genuine movement.

He asked a veteran Fuller church history professor, Paul Pierson, who provided those characteristics:9 movements r us 211 They always begin on the periphery of the institutional church.

They are motivated by a transforming experience (grace) of God by an individual or group.

The result is the desire for a more authentic Christian life that often leads to concern for the church and world.

Face-to-face groups for prayer, Bible study, and mutual encouragement are important.

New methods of selecting and training leaders become important.

These are less institutional and more grassroots and lay oriented.

There are theological breakthroughs, that is, rediscovery of aspects of the biblical message that have been forgotten or overlooked by the church; usually they focus on the gifts of every believer.

Biblical concepts ignored by the traditional church but relevant to the hearers are often discovered.

There is a leveling effect as distance decreases between clergy and laity, social classes, races, men and women, and denominations.

The movement is countercultural in some ways, often because it reaches out to those who have not been valued by their society.

Consequently there will be opposition by many in the dominant culture and church.

There will often be manifestations of spiritual warfare.

Such movements sense the reality of evil and the need to recognize the victory of Christ in the Cross and Resurrection.

At times there will be unusual manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit: healings, visions, speaking in tongues, miracles, and so on.

More flexible structures of church and mission will be needed and often emerge, different from traditional structures.

The movement will be led to significant recontextualization of the Christian message, which will be communicated more widely by laypersons to those outside the church.

New cultural forms and art are often a characteristic.

There will be a growing concern for those who are marginalized, often expressed in ministries of compassion.

At a later stage, this often leads to concern for broader social transformation.

As the movement matures, there will be concern for the renewal of the broader church.

As the movement continues to mature, many will see themselves not only as part of the movement but as citizens of the kingdom of God, transcending their own movement. 212 the permanent revolution Every movement is less than perfect and often messy at the edges and sometimes the center.

This is inevitable as long as sinful humans are involved.

We might add more characteristics like clear thought leaders, differentiated culture and self-understanding, a strategy for leader training, and others.

And although not all movements display all of these characteristics, they ought to be present to some degree.10 In pulling all these together in a cohesive model, we suggest that distinctly apostolic forms of movements have the following traits:11 Apostolic movements thrive in the atmosphere of belief.

All movements breathe an atmosphere of “can do” or, perhaps even better, “will do.” Apostolic movements believe their message, see themselves as conduits of that message, and are willing to put their lives on the line to deliver it.

They have a transformational vision for society, and a sense that they have a role to play in its transformation.

They are believers.

Apostolic movements exhibit the structure of networks.

The favored structure of dynamic apostolic movements is that of the more fluid, decentralized, adaptive network where power and function are dispersed throughout the organization, even at its outer edges.12 To use a rather unfortunate comparison, the apostolic form will tend to look like the structure of an al Qaeda, where operatives, cells, and organizations are highly adaptive, easily reproduced, and hard to eliminate.

More positive examples of dynamic networking in movements are the Apaches in the wars against the conquistadors, Alcoholics Anonymous, the women’s movement, and environmentalists.

Clearly this was the form of the early church as well as that of early Methodism and the Chinese underground church, and, of course, the early church.

Apostolic movements spread like viruses.

All powerful ideas spread like viruses.

They are in a real sense caught and passed on, and they do so in a viral, epidemical way.

Apostolic movements that reach the power curve of exponential impact are in a real sense, pay-it-forward movements.

They transfer ideas exponentially, and these ideas are profound enough to lodge themselves in people’s minds and change the way they think and act.

For an idea to be spreadable, it needs to be simple enough for the audience to understand it.

But to take root and transform the audience, it needs to be complex enough to carry a load of meaning.

The rallying cry, “Jesus is Lord,” and the gospel itself carry both of these aspects within it. movements r us 213 Apostolic movements are reproducing and reproducible.

Such movements are precommitted to multiplication formulas of growth and not simply addition.

But the commitment to reproducing everything easily and rapidly implies a commitment to keeping things reproducible.

For instance, evangelism, discipleship, leadership formation, ecclesiology itself, and church planting need to be relatively easily reproduced by any serious and committed agent (churches and individuals) in the system. (Because this is a major issue in organization, we explore this more fully in the discussion of four-self principles in the next chapter.) Further explorations can be found in On the Verge, Neil Cole’s Church 3.0, and Dwight Friesen’s Thy Kingdom Connected.13 We simply state these here because if leaders wish to move to a more apostolic approach to organization, it stands to reason that they need to (re)learn how they function and operate.

To be a movement, we need to learn how to think like a movement, and then to act like a movement.

The Starfish and the Spider A further aspect of highly transformative movements worth more exploration is the idea of decentralization and networking.

Based on numerous examples of decentralized networks, ranging from Alcoholics Anonymous to Skype and Wikipedia, the authors of The Starfish and the Spider, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, present a model of decentralized organization and the new rules it implies.14 Perhaps the best way to describe the power of decentralized movements is to elaborate on the metaphor in the title of the book.

In terms of organizations, a spider and a starfish might look the same (at least each has eight legs), but their organization are worlds apart. A spider that loses a leg might well be able to function.

It might even be able to operate minus three legs, although its survival would be endangered if it lost four.

However, it will die if it loses its head, because its central nervous system is located there.

The starfish is a different animal altogether.

Cut a leg off a starfish, and it grows back, and the leg that was cut off will actually grow into another starfish.

Cut the starfish into ten pieces, and you end up with ten starfish.

In other words, every element in its system has the full capacity to reproduce itself.

If one observes what is going on in the book of Acts, one can easily discern that New Testament ecclesiology is more like the starfish than the spider.

The same is true for the grassroots church in India, Church Multiplication Associates, and many other apostolic movements. 214 the permanent revolution Furthermore, on closer examination, movements are composed of many circles, or a fractal-like network of networks.15 Each circle is an independently functioning decentralized network consisting of autonomous and interdependent units.

And these tend to lack the hierarchy or structure normally associated with centralized command-and-control organizations.

Instead of normal hierarchy, people movements depend on ideas and beliefs to hold the system together and reach their objectives; they are built on a foundation of shared ideology.

These beliefs are self-enforced by the various members of the movement.

Knowledge and intelligence are deliberately spread throughout the organization.

And because everyone is a stakeholder in the outcomes, there is a sense of reliance and trust throughout the community.

Furthermore, because the organization is decentralized and intelligent, individual units in the movement adapt quickly to changes in their various environments and can advance and grow under the radar.

In Brafman and Beckstrom’s view, leadership comes initially in the form of the catalyst, who either initiates a new circle or enhances an existing one.16 However, once the circle is up and running, the catalyst moves on, transferring active leadership to the members and the more socially cohesive leadership of the champion.

Leadership does not exist to create dependencies in the members but rather for the full empowerment of the other members in pursuit of the movement’s goals.

Think of Alcoholics Anonymous and Greenpeace here.

If we relate this to APEST typologies, it is most likely the Pauline apostle who will initiate new movement, lay the foundations for its ongoing sustainability, and then move on to other frontiers.

This makes space for the ministries of the Petrine apostles, prophets, and evangelists to step up to the fore and propel the movement forward, the evangelist in our view being the one most likely to fulfill the role of the champion.

We see this taking place in Paul’s ministry when he leaves a church that he has planted and nurtured or sends Timothy to Ephesus and tells him to do the work of an evangelist.

Although these characteristics are true for all kinds of people movements, they certainly describe the dynamics of apostolic movements as we find them in the Bible and in history.

It is not hard to discern, for instance, that this is how the massively expanding movements of the contemporary developing world operate.

Interestingly Paul explicitly considers himself to be an apostle, an evangelist, and a teacher (1 Timothy 2:7; 2 Timothy 1:11); in terms of starfish dynamics, this equals a combination of catalyst, champion, and original thinker in one person.

Paul’s movements r us 215 contribution to the Christian movement signals precisely this form of catalytic influence, and it is still felt as powerfully today as it ever was.

In the New Testament, though, we move beyond the somewhat twodimensional idea of leadership in The Starfish and the Spider to the fivefold APEST form, which easily incorporates the typology of catalyst and champion and integrates the more operative forms of shepherd and teacher as well.

It is much more sustainable as a result.

Truly New Testament ecclesiology is biased toward movements.

Ending with the Beginning in Mind It is now common to hear the phrase that we must begin with the end in mind, and it is perfectly true for leadership as well as organizations.

If you want apostolic movement, you must begin with a clear understanding of what this means or miss the mark entirely.

This is exactly why builders need blueprints in order to build a skyscraper, or even a large house for that matter.

But if we must begin with the end in mind, it is also true that we must end with the beginning in mind.

To be genuinely apostolic, the basic organizational formulas factored into the initial movement should be sustainable over time and throughout the life of the organization.

An apostolic algorithm should be consistent at front and back.

The following are applications of this principle.

Learn from the Fractal Apostolic organization is very similar to that of the fractal, “a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.”17 When the basic unit is paired with the same shape, it grows accordingly but retains the characteristics of the original shape.
