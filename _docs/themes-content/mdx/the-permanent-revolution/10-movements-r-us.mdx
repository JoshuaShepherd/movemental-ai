# Movements R Us

The smallest part therefore is reflected in every part and throughout the whole.

When a simple triangle multiplies on itself, a pattern emerges (Figure 10.1).

This design can develop into infinite complexity and still be based on the initial formula.18 This fractal, one of the simplest, demonstrates the principle that is true to all fractals: the whole is made up of the recursion of the smallest part.

What is remarkable is that the iterative and recursive design found in fractals is integral to many aspects of life itself.

Neil Cole elaborates on this in his seminal book Organic Church.19 He rightly notes that fractals can, indeed must, apply to discipleship, leadership development, church planting and reproduction, and eventually into movement extension itself: "The pattern remains the same no matter how many times it is multiplied.

To have a leadership structure that grows with the body, we need to have a similar design that maintains its own integrity no matter how many times it is multiplied.

Likewise, a global movement can be divided into smaller units that all maintain the same core formation.”20 The triangle in Figure 10.1 shows that no matter how far down you divide the shape, the original fractal design remains true.

This can provide a pattern and direction for units exploding in a chain reaction, whereas the traditional organizational model cannot.

That last phrase rings true for apostolic approaches to organization.

Movements thrive on simplicity, reproducibility, and scalability.

If you believe that discipleship is basic to what it means to be a church, put a clear pathway to discipleship in the process at the start.

If you try movements r us 217 to factor this in later, it is very difficult and is unlikely to succeed.

The same is true for leadership, multiplication, reproducibility, and so on.

Again, if the initial model is not readily reproducible by the “nonprofessional” regular Christian, then it will not be magically reproducible by them later on.

If it is built on a professional model of ministry and leadership (clergy), then that is what you will have to deal with all along the way, and at a great price.

Get the base formula or algorithm right, pray like mad, and the rest will flow well.

Plant Movements, Not Churches If you want to end with a movement, you need to start with a movemental idea and approach.

This seems obvious, but all denominations started as dynamic movement, but because they were not attentive to the shifting issues of organization, they likely ended up in another place altogether.

So plant movements, not churches.

This is a big part of why it is important to begin with the end in mind: if you want a movement, you must think of ecclesia beyond the idea of a single local church before you begin.

Once again, as every seed has the full potential for a tree and the tree the full potential of the forest, so too every church (indeed every believer) has the full potential of a movement in it.

This is implied in the powerful slogan of an underground Chinese church movement: “Every believer is a church planter, and every church is a church-planting church.” Every believer has ecclesia (church) in him or her, and every ecclesia is responsible for the reproduction of others; in other words, they all make a movement.

This approach is also useful in getting beyond distorted, highly institutionalized ideas of the church in order to focus on planting movements instead of planting churches.

The distinctly apostolic form of thinking behind this is to think movements and not churches.

Plant the Gospel, Not Churches Yet another way of beginning with the end in mind and ending with the beginning in mind is to plant the gospel, not churches.

This does not cancel out what we said above; it simply changes the equation in a way that helps us think differently about the same task.

One of the core tasks of apostolic ministry is to plant churches, but we are increasingly convinced that the term church planting itself is problematic.

That is partly because we are never actually commanded to plant churches.

In the Bible, that is always considered to be Jesus’s job; for our 218 the permanent revolution part, we are called to evangelize the world by making disciples (Matthew 28:18–20).

But the phrase is also problematic because of associations with the word church in the cultural memory of the West.

For Christians and non-Christians alike, the word church almost always conjures up the profoundly stylized images of buildings, clergy, rituals, and denominational templates.

We have a very well-formed, or rather often misinformed, idea of what the church is and what it is all about.

To get to the real heart of the Great Commission, we suggest that it might be useful to drop the phrase “church planting”; instead we should begin to focus on the approach of “gospel planting.” This is actually very useful because it takes us to the core of what missionary work is about in the first place: planting the message of Jesus and cultivating contextualized communities of faith that shape themselves around it.

It involves a process that is Jesus focused and strong on incarnational forms of mission.

As such it squares with the approach that it is Christology (the kingdom of God as it expresses itself in Jesus) that must directly shape our missiology (our purpose and mission in God’s world), which in turn must shape our ecclesiology (the cultural form and function of the church).21 Some years ago, Dee Hock, the brilliant founder of Visa Corporation, coined the word chaordic to indicate the kind of organization that manages to balance some kind of enduring structure at its center, which develops the strategic direction and maintains and enforces the movement’s core ideas and yet allows the kind of regional extension, scalability, and rapid-fire adaptability required to advance its cause.

The word is a combination of chaos and order.

This type of organization is what Hock calls chaordic—one that has a deeply held purpose and set of principles at the very center (these provide the order, the intellectual center, and the basis of decision making and operations) and yet also has high creativity at the edges (normally associated with chaos).

See how this chaordic approach works its way out in these following statements: “Purpose and principle, clearly understood and articulated, and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization.

To the degree you hold purpose and principles in common among you, you can dispense with command and control.

People will know how to behave in accordance with them, and they’ll do it in thousands of unimaginable, creative ways.

The organization will become a vital, living set of beliefs.”22 And he says elsewhere, “An organization’s success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles, and strength of belief in them than to movements r us 219 assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be.”23 Order and chaos, structure and creativity, find a perfect and productive balance in organizations of this kind.

The Internet and many Internet-based organizations, Alcoholics Anonymous, Semco (Ricardo Semler’s companies), and Hock’s own Visa International are examples of organizations built squarely on chaordic principles.24 Hock’s ideas deserve serious attention: he has developed and led one of the biggest businesses in the world—one that has an annual turnover of $1.2 trillion, no headquarters, and only five hundred employees.

Visa is truly a globally recognized brand that is organizationally invisible at the same time.

This is no mean feat and well worthy of our study.

As an advocate of living systems approaches to organization, Hock is describing something built into the rhythms and design of life itself as it applies to human organizations.

This kind of chaordic organization is close to what we can see in the early church and other apostolic movements.

Early Methodism, for instance, grew rapidly in spite of a lack of centralized organization and telephonic communications.

Similarly, if one were to ask how the early church held together and expanded in a cohesive way in spite of having little that we take for granted as basic, one can answer only that the Holy Spirit chose to use something like what Hock calls chaordic principles.

It had no central organization to speak of, no payroll, no denominational headquarters, and no executives.

It held together based on adherence to the grand idea of Jesus as Lord, a call to live and extend his mission, and organized differently in different places.

Chaordic principles, with their roots in living systems theory (with links to cosmology and how the Creator has designed things), their way of connecting community and an individual sense of purpose, their respect for human dignity, and their being deeply principled in nature offer us a nearly perfect approach to developing apostolic movements.

They also capture well the concept of apostolic leadership and architecture that holds fast to the core DNA of the church while at the same time giving massive permission for ongoing cultural innovation, organizational adaptability, and missional extension.

The original Jesus movement was chaordic, and that is exactly what is needed now.

Whether one is working with an established church or starting a new one, chaordic approaches are relevant throughout the life cycle of the organization.

So as far as the concept of a chaordic organization is concerned, apostolic movements tend to have the following characteristics: 220 the permanent revolution Are based on clarity of a theologically substantial sense of purpose, methodology, and principles Are self-organizing and self-governing in whole and in part Exist primarily to enable their constituent parts Are consistent with the kingdom of God Are powered from the periphery and unified from the core Are durable in purpose and principle and malleable in form and function Learn, adapt, and innovate in ever-expanding cycles Liberate and amplify ingenuity, initiative, and judgment Equitably distribute power, rights, responsibility, and rewards (“to each is given”; Ephesians 4:7) Harmoniously combine cooperation and competition Are compatible with human dignity and spirit in that the organization gives more than it takes Compatible with and foster diversity, complexity, and change Constructively use and harmonize conflict and paradox Changing the organizational self-understanding and culture needs time and a good process.

Following similar principles, I (Alan) have sought to develop a thoroughly chaordic approach to developing apostolic movements in On the Verge, my book with Dave Ferguson.25 Here, we give a brief summary of the process laid out in significant detail there.

To initiate and maintain movemental organizations requires a definite apostolic leadership vision as well as a keen sense of process.

We suggest the following main parts of that process. IM AGINE .

To be and become an apostolic movement, we have to have the right image and imagination of the organization.

Apostolic imagination guides how we think about ecclesia and move on to imagining new possibilities.

Imagination allows us to see the mission as Jesus sees it.

Failure to capture the mind and heart of leadership at this point will mean frustration and failure in anything that follows.

This highlights the importance of apostolic vision and leadership in helping people think differently about the church. Shift.

Shift has three aspects: The process of embedding a core DNA at the very heart of the organization, one that is entirely consistent with apostolic movement paradigm.

This means re/setting the organizational brain (or DNA, scripts, codes, or the like) to think apostolically about the church. movements r us 221 Recall the discussion of this earlier in this book and also in The Forgotten Ways: when the apostolic genius system (comprising the dynamic interplay between Jesus’s lordship, discipleship, incarnational mission, APEST, organic systems, and communitas) becomes the interpretive paradigm at the core of the organization, it will guide all subsequent thinking and acting throughout the organization.26 Developing an ethos and culture that are consistent with the paradigm and do not hinder its progress.

It involves developing language and core values, identifying the heroes who embody the vision and values, along with coherent branding and communication, rituals and symbols, and missional metrics.

Together this apostolic ethos creates the platform with which to develop the next stage.

Developing sets of practices that shape and guide the members’ actions and rhythms.

Most people, particularly nonleaders in the community, do not have to grasp all the conceptual ideas to be able to do it.

In fact, simply doing certain well-constructed and rhythmic practices, woven into the fabric of the community and over long periods of time, changes people. INNOVATE.

The need for genuine innovation arises as a natural outflow of the embedding of apostolic identity, ethos, and practices contained in the shift process.

People need permission and skills to help the church or the movement generate new cultural forms and expressions of the kingdom of God.

Everybody needs to innovate. MOV EMENTUM.

Movementum can be defined as the process of gaining missional momentum until we birth an apostolic movement.

It occurs when we are continuously taking our church through the preceding three stages: imagine, shift, and innovate.

Developing a self-organizing, self-governing, trustworthy organization usually requires intensive effort.

Taking the necessary time and not rushing it is important.

During this time, a representative group of individuals (we call them the drafting team) is drawn from leadership in all parts and levels of the organization.

Led by an apostolic person, they should meet regularly and work through the initial framing and implementation of the process.

Then it is vital to identify all key stakeholders—people who are directly affected by changes and have much to lose or gain in the process.

Invite the sharing of the concerns as well as their ideas.

Do not limit this 222 the permanent revolution to top-level leadership.

One of the best applications of this aspect of the process has been done at Granger Community Church in Indiana, where even its technical team is well informed about missional movement and how the leaders intend to get there.

Everyone feels informed and in some way involved.27 Covering the Bases One of the gifts of thinking movementally about the church is that it gives us an idea of the church that encompasses and embraces the contributions of every part.

Nothing is left out in the kingdom economy of church as Jesus designed it.

For too long, the church has left the vast majority of players off the field.

In a movement, as many as possible are activated.

Every person, collective, church, and organization plays a part in the destiny of the whole.

Seen in this way, the church contains incredible potential and latent capacity.

Apostolic organization seeks to capture this intelligence and focus on the task set before it.

To get this idea across, recently Dave Ferguson had members of Community Christian in Chicago who were willing to be missional in all of life to stand up, and he subsequently ordained them.

They certainly got the message that they were all valuable and equal players in God’s kingdom.

Movements tend to start with individuals, who together form into groups around a common cause and eventually mobilize for continuous movement by using ever more expansive levels of organization.

In the words of living systems theory, ecclesia is a nested hierarchy consisting of an increasingly complex organization, much like Russian nesting dolls where each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outermost doll.28 In a nested hierarchy, each layer builds on the next, incorporating what precedes into what follows and never leaving anything behind.

Even the smallest, apparently inconspicuous part of the system is an irreplaceable part of the whole.

For instance, in New Testament ecclesiology, Paul insists we are all the body of Christ, and each one of us is a vital part of it (see 1 Corinthians 12:12–27; Ephesians 4:7–16).

There is a deep and profound interdependence of each part—all of God’s people are chosen and have destiny and significance.

This is exactly why the church damages its own capacity to function as Jesus intended when we marginalize any member of the body of Christ.

When we apply the idea of nested hierarchy to apostolic organization, we need to be attentive to the basic unit of ecclesia as much as we need to attend to the larger issues of movement and multiplication.

All aspects movements r us 223 are vital.

There are at least four layers of nested hierarchy in the ecclesia: the individual/human, the social/communal, the organizational/system, and the movement/exponential multiplication (Figure 10.2).

Apostolic movements will always require varying levels of organization—the individual, community, organization, and movement.

But each level requires a different leader’s response, skill set, and focus.

What is required at the base level of the individual will not produce movement, but if the base level is not attended to, no movement will be possible.

Trying to achieve significant movement without paying attention to each successive layer and what is required there is like pressing harder on the gas pedal while remaining in first gear: RPM will increase, but without shifting gears, it will not accelerate movement.

The same is true in an apostolic movement.

In order for motion to translate into movement, there need to be strategic shifts along the way that Movement/exponential multiplication Organizational/ system Social/ communal Individual/ human 224 the permanent revolution release different potentials and capacities throughout the organization.

Anticipating, and hence preparing for, these consecutive transition points will help prevent a movement from recoiling in on itself.

This does not minimize the importance of the individual elements at the base level.

In fact, it only highlights their determinative nature.

Without a good basis in each preceding level, the ecclesia cannot develop into a fully fledged movement, even though it contains all the potential to do so.

In Figure 10.3, you can see some of the essential functions of foundational apostolic ministry: discipling, networking, architecting, and resourcing.

These are foundational but are also reflected throughout the whole.

As foundations, they form a platform for all subsequent layers in the nested hierarchy.

Although they are always present at every level, the focus shifts as the level of organization moves to the next stage.

At all stages, leadership should have these four functions in mind, but emphasis will shift as the organization develops toward movement.

So while strategic emphasis will shift depending on the level of organization, development at every level should still be attentive to building individual, social, systemic, and exponential capacities.

Discipling the individual should begin with the end in mind and end with the beginning in mind. individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities individual social systemic exponential capacities capacities capacities capacities Levels of Organization movements r us 225 Remember, in every believer is the possibility of a movement.

As the forest is contained within the potential of a seed, so in every individual Christ follower is the possibility of community, and in a community the real possibility of a translocal, transformative movement.

Seeing people in this way (we believe it is the way Jesus sees us) changes the way we perceive and do “church” forever.

It is this dynamically apostolic, profoundly movemental quality that the institutional view of ecclesia conceals from our view.

An example of this movemental approach can be seen in Trinity Grace Church in New York City, led by movement starter Jon Tyson, from Australia.

As an apostolic leader, he is attentive to basic algorithms, reproducibility, discipleship, scalability, and core theology.

As a result he has developed a flourishing, fully reproducible movement in the making in one of the hardest contexts for the gospel in the United States. 3DM adopted a similar approach with its lifeshapes model, which embeds key practices at every level of organization.

It has eight distinct shapes, each representing a different aspect of discipleship and church life.

All members are apprenticed into using the shapes as a way of forming their lives and formatting their ministries.29 In this chapter we have suggested that the archetypal organizational form for apostolic ministry and impact is that of the people movement.

No one would doubt that the New Testament church, as well as the subsequent early church, was a formidable, highly transformative people movement.

Whenever that movement form was explicitly adopted since then, either because of circumstance (for example, persecution) or because of new apostolic work among new groups, the church has grown exponentially.

Whether it was the Celtic church that evangelized Western Europe, the early Methodists who had a profound impact on the world, the Moravians, early Pentecostals, the Chinese underground church, and the others, movements are the forms of the church that change the world.

We are now seeing the early adoption (or maybe readoption) of these forms among more established churches.

The movement that emerged from St.

Thomas Crookes in Sheffield is a good case in point.

But churches as diverse as Southside (in British Columbia), the Austin Stone, the Tampa Underground, Granger Community Church, New Thing Network, and Missio, all are heading in this direction.

Organization matters.

It involves the mobilization of bias in one form or another.

If we hope to be a missional movement in our age, we must set about designing and biasing the church to be the high-impact missional agency it was intended to be in the first place.

The effectiveness of 226 the permanent revolution the church and the healthy spread of the gospel are inextricably connected with our capacity to organize rightly.

The medium must become the message and strive for more consistency with it.

We have no doubt that the apostolic movement is the form that gives the church its best opportunity to extend Christianity far into this century.

Far from being alien to who we are, movements are our most primal form, and we are at our best behavior and have the greatest impact when we are moving along with the Holy Spirit.

Movements R Us! ‌Apostolic Architecture the anatomy of missional organization Much of what we face can’t be deterred, prevented or even predicted.

Thus we need to become resilient.

There is nothing neutral about the way we organize.

The most important ideas of all are meta-ideas, that is, ideas about how to support the production and transmission of other ideas. dee hock, the founder of visa whom we met in chapter ten, was called in by the banking system in the 1960s to find a solution to the increasing complexities presented by the introduction of the credit card system.

It was widely agreed that credit cards themselves were a major innovation for the finance and banking sector, but at that point, each bank and corporation had its own credit card.

This meant that consumers had to carry up to twenty different credit cards.

The bankers knew that this was unsustainable, so they called Hock in to help sort out the crisis.

Hock knew that if a solution was left to the bankers, their focus would be on order, which would result in massive bureaucracy—an unproductive no-win situation.

He reasoned that if the problem was left to the more creative types, there would likely be a lot of new ideas but a lot of unsustainable chaos, and the credit card would not survive.

That is when Hock designed the chaordic system. 228 the permanent revolution How we structure organization has a direct impact on outcomes—for good or for ill—and leadership must be aware of the implications and face the consequences.

Church Resource Ministries founder and international director Sam Metcalf maintains that apostolic impact comes about when the apostolic mission is providing the appropriate structures.

His basic formula is that apostolic ministry plus apostolic structure equals apostolic effectiveness.

We agree.

Forms and structures can either inhibit or promote a cause, and they need constant revitalization to ensure that they do not become ends in themselves.

Organizations exist to maintain and deliver the function for which they were made.

It is no good trying to build a revived apostolic ministry and structure it around forms and organizations that are built to deliver something fundamentally different.

The wineskin won’t hold, and the wine will be wasted (Luke 5:37–39).

That is why we need to explore new ways of organizing that are more consistent with the function.

The forms we suggest here are those consistent with apostolic and missional bias for movement.

We have already mentioned that over time and under the influence of an increasingly institutionalized view of the church, the apostolic ministry so evident throughout the biblical and postbiblical period was eventually sidelined and delegitimized.

The apostolic imagination was lost and the view of the church and its mission narrowed.

Increasingly, the ecclesia of Christ was identified exclusively as the local church, with a nod toward the overarching concept contained in the idea of the church’s catholicity—the belief in the church universal.

The more translocal, distinctly movemental understandings of ecclesia were lost.

The significantly diminished view of New Testament ecclesiology was disastrous to the mission and effectiveness of the kind of church that Jesus intended.

The church came to be viewed as a hospital for ailing souls or a bastion of theological truth, or some combination of both.

Gone was the grand vision for a transformed world.

The church had given birth to the so-called Christian civilization, only to become its subservient chaplain.

The movement originally made up of pioneers and settlers became increasingly dominated by the settlers to the exclusion of the pioneers.

It is not our goal here to write extensively about every possible aspect of apostolic organization, but rather to outline ways in which we believe it is likely to take shape.

Here we apply apostolic imagination on the way organization ought to be both conceived and designed.

Based on what we know from history and from best practices in organizational theory, we advocate some specific characteristics that are more suited to apostolic architecture 229 the missional challenges we face and will foster the much-needed adaptation demanded of Christian organizations now.

Leadership is unlikely to achieve X objective when the organization is biased to achieving a Y objective.

Apple trees are, to put it metaphorically, unlikely to produce oranges.

So too, organizations produce according to their kind.

Design matters.

We think that the church of Jesus Christ is designed for missional impact, and if it is not achieving that, then something has gone wrong in the design department.

Linda Bergquist and Allan Karr’s book, Church Turned Inside Out, takes issues of design seriously: the approach they suggest of design, redesign, and alignment is very useful at this point.1 Organizational imagineer Gareth Morgan rightly maintains that “organizations are rarely established as ends in themselves.

They are instruments created to achieve other ends.”2 Organizations are designed with a distinct purpose in mind.

This is also true for our understanding of ecclesia, particularly insofar as the distinctly organizational aspects are concerned.

The church, in confessing that it is a sign, symbol, and instrument of the kingdom, recognizes that it is a tool, an instrument, in the hands of her Lord.

Problems in organizational design arise when the context changes and the organization itself does not, when the organization itself becomes the mission, or when the organization veers from the path of its original designers.

If leaders choose to ignore the issue of design (and the question of constant redesign) and how it directly determines outcomes, then they will inadvertently hand the organization over to latent forces that can be directly at odds with the purposes that members want to achieve.

The inevitable result is frustration, even lots of it, at every level of the organization.

Such situations are natural seedbeds for dissension, dissatisfaction, and even revolution.

As Clay Shirky, the author of the best-selling Here Comes Everybody, observes, “The hallmark of revolution is that the goals of the revolutionaries cannot be contained by the institutional structure of the existing society.

As a result, either the revolutionaries are put down, or some of those institutions are altered, replaced or destroyed.”3 This again echoes Jesus’s clear warnings about the problem of wineskins (Matthew 9:14–17).

Because we are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving, if the church is in decline, then at least in part it reflects the 230 the permanent revolution fact that we are not operating according to its original apostolic design.

The church that Jesus intended and designed is made for impact—and massive, highly transformative impact at that.

Jesus said, “I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18).

Note here that Jesus says that the gates of hell do not prevail against us.

It is we as God’s people who are on the advance here, not the forces of hell.

Contrary to many of the images of church as a defensive fortress suffering the relentless onslaughts of the enemy, the movement that Jesus set in motion is designed to be an advancing, untamed, and untamable revolutionary force created to transform the world.

And make no mistake: there is in Jesus’s words a sense of inevitability about the eventual triumph of the gospel and the ecclesia, his chief instrument.

If we are not somehow part of this grand movement, then we have to question, among other things, if there is something wrong in the prevailing ways we have designed and organized ourselves.4 Four-Self Dynamics Some serious movemental thinking can be observed in the seminal missiology of Henry Venn and others who developed the concept of generating indigenous churches based on what became known as the three-self principle: self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation.

While recognizing that in fact Jesus is Lord and that the reference to “self” here is not meant to be interpreted in the sense of the autonomous self so prevalent in our Western culture, the principles here are intended to capture the God-given right of all peoples to have their own distinct cultural identity.

Following their missionary instincts, along with the methodological clues contained in the scriptures themselves, movement starters must encourage local, indigenous forms of ecclesia and discourage the adoption of foreign cultural forms.

Missionaries must actively discourage any childlike dependency by the new churches that would hinder their growth and maturity.

This kind of dependency can be observed in many missionary contexts (Africa and Papua New Guinea, for example), where new churches were made dependent on external missionary support and failed not to flourish as a result.

They became known as “rice Christians”—people who converted for the benefits such as rice that the foreign missionaries brought.

The same principle is true for many denominational church plants in the West.

New “parachute” church plants that are fully funded by denominational headquarters and lack a grassroots mission approach to evangelism and mission have less independence and are less likely to flourish. apostolic architecture 231 An ardent disciple of the three-self principles, seminal thinker Roland Allen taught that the church’s missionary activity derives not from organizational control but from “the expression of the spontaneous individual activity of its members; for every member was potentially a missionary.”5 Out of his mission experience around the turn of the nineteenth century in China, he reflected on the factors that encouraged and inhibited the spontaneous expansion of the gospel.

These were his conclusions: Factors That Encourage Spontaneous Expansion When people whose lives have been affected profoundly by the gospel tell their story to those who know them.

When from the beginning, evangelism is the work of those within the culture.

When new Christians are immediately given the opportunity to learn by ministering to non-Christians rather than sitting in a classroom.

When the church is self-supporting and provides for its own leaders and facilities.

When true doctrine results from the true experience of the power of Christ rather than mere intellectual instruction.6 When new churches are given the freedom to learn by experience.7 Factors That Inhibit Spontaneous Expansion When paid (foreign) professionals are primarily responsible to spread the gospel, which is then perceived as an alien intrusion.

When the church becomes dependent on external funds and leadership.8 When spread of the gospel is controlled out of fear, and both error and godly zeal are suppressed.

Allen believed the great things of God are beyond our control.

He observed that control produces sterility.

Thinking of the Western missions he experienced in China, he noted, “Our converts have not gone astray, but neither they have produced anything.”9 When it is believed that the church is to be founded, educated, and equipped, established in the doctrine and ethics and organization first; then it is to expand.10 When emerging leaders are restricted from ministering until they are fully trained.

In this way, they learn the lesson of inactivity and dependency.11 232 the permanent revolution When we attempt to convert by clever argument rather than the power of Christ.

When a professional class controls the ministry and discourages the spontaneous zeal of those who are not members of their profession.12 There is a lot of apostolic movement power in the principles of spontaneous expansion (and a lot of stopping power in the inhibiting factors).

For instance, in 1899, John Livingston Nevius, an apostle to China and a devotee of the three-self principles, trained a groups of missionaries who were going into groups of previously unreached people in Korea in the use of the three-self principles.13 The missionaries sent to establish the Korean church adopted them, and the mission was wildly successful.

The historical irony is significant.

The ideas themselves were originally formulated in China, prior to the communist revolution, but the Chinese church never took the three-self principles seriously, and therefore the growth in China was painstakingly slow.

The mission in Korea adopted them wholeheartedly, and the movement grew exponentially and continues to do so to this day.14 The lessons are stark: the way we organize has a direct impact on the church’s capacity to be the transformative people movement it was originally designed to be.

To underscore this point, we need only recognize that the exponentially expanding Chinese underground movement was not born until after the purging of foreign missionaries from China in the early 1950s.

In the wake of this and after waves of serious persecution, the church was forced to discover the power of indigenous, organic growth.

It seems that God had to remove the professional Christians, along with the institutional forms of church that they maintained, so that the people of God could become the people of God.

This perhaps was the real revolution going on in the Chinese Revolution.

We suggest that the original three-self principles could be updated and expanded to four: all apostolic movements ought to strive to be selforganizing, self-generating, self-sustaining, and self-reflecting (Figure 11.1).15 Using this framework will undoubtedly steer us away from many problems related to institutionalization, not to mention the avoidance of unhealthy dependencies down the track.

Self-Organizing Essentially any organization is an effort to contain, channel, or mobilize resources.

The idea of self-organization is no different.

All living apostolic architecture 233 Movemental organization Self-reflecting Self-generating Self-organizing Self-sustaining systems have the seemingly natural capacity to organize themselves in order to achieve the desired outcomes.

This is perhaps especially true for the ecclesia, which not only has the guiding presence of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16), and a direct relationship with the Lord, but has built-in spiritual intelligence by which it can operate (Ephesians 4:7–16; 1 Corinthians:12–14; Romans 12:1–7).

This is entirely consistent with the concept of self-organization in living systems theory, which both recognizes and seeks to enhance the innate potential within groups of people to self-organize through an evolving process that draws on existing resources within and around the group.

Thought leaders Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers rightly note: All living systems have the capacity to self-organize, to sustain themselves and move toward greater complexity and order as needed.

They can respond intelligently to the need for change.

They organize (and then reorganize) themselves into adaptive patterns and structures without any externally imposed plan or direction In these systems, change is the organizing force, not a problematic intrusion.

Structures and solutions are temporary.

Resources and people come together to create new initiatives, to respond to new regulations, to shift the organization’s processes.

Leaders emerge from the needs of the moment.

There are far fewer levels of management.

Experimentation is the norm.16 234 the permanent revolution Although they did not use the term itself, self-organizing is exactly what the original apostles sought to develop in the life of the local communities they helped establish.17 Clearly they took people and place, with the associated cultural forms, seriously.

For instance, what worked culturally and theologically in Jerusalem would not necessarily work in Corinth, and they did not assume it would.

Because their particular sense of calling, together with their desire to faithfully witness (and sometimes their very survival), were at stake, local disciples and communities became real stakeholders, experts at processing the problems they faced.

In this way, they allowed group involvement and participation to constantly deepen.

Learning was shared not as a formula or model for others to copy, but as an application of missiological thinking and approaches to problem solving.

Steve Addison is right when he says that “centralization and standardization are the enemies of innovation.”18 We have already seen that the truly great organizations do not make their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning.

What they do is “try a lot of stuff and see what works” and then freely share their learnings with others.19 The concept of local leadership (elders and deacons) itself supports the idea of local disciples being ultimately responsible for witness and health as a Jesus community in their area.

When Paul sends members of his apostolic team to help establish elders in the local churches, he is doing precisely this (Titus 1:5).

All efforts at helping the local churches get established and grow to maturity involve an increasing transfer of power from the founder to the community that he or she has founded.

To do otherwise would be to create dependencies that undermine the idea of the church as the body of Christ, and therefore as an expansive people movement.

Although Paul certainly takes a parental interest in the congregations around the empire, he does not (even cannot) dominate or disempower them.

Although he does exercise spiritual authority and leadership when it matters, over time he seeks to wean them from his direct influence.20 Self-Generating Each community was responsible for not only its own survival but also for extending the message by evangelizing, discipling, and planting the gospel. A message exists to be passed on, and the church of Jesus is at core a message tribe.

This is what the original framers of the three-self principles called self-propagation; the Bible calls it fruitfulness.

Both point at the reproductive capacities of the ecclesia.

As Neil Cole rather wryly notes, “If you can’t reproduce disciples, you can’t reproduce apostolic architecture 235 If you can’t reproduce disciples, you’ll never reproduce leaders.

If you can’t reproduce leaders, you’ll never reproduce churches.

If you can’t reproduce churches, you’ll never see a movement.

If you can’t reproduce leaders, you can’t reproduce churches.

If you can’t reproduce churches, you can’t reproduce movements.”21 This is illustrated in Figure 11.2, which shows that reproduction should occur naturally at every succeeding level of complexity, beginning at the smallest, simplest level.

It is hard to get around the sheer truth of this.

Generativity, involving the commitment to reproduction and reproducibility, must be factored into the base equation of the apostolic movement.

The commitment is at the DNA level—as inviolable as genetics is in forming and perpetuating life itself.

To leave this out in principle means to end up with an organization or system that, like an infertile mule, not only will not reproduce itself but in fact cannot do so.

Most prevailing forms of church cannot be easily reproduced except by professionals, and even then, it is done well only by very few of them.

Of the 400,000 churches in the United States, only a few can be considered reproductive and fruitful.

For instance, Neil Cole, reflecting on research done by the Southern Baptist research and resource center called Lifeway, notes that only 4 percent of Southern Baptist churches in the United States will plant a daughter church.

Extrapolated across the denominations, that means that 96 percent of the conventional churches in the United States will never give birth.

Cole goes on to show the missionally perilous misconceptions inherent in this thinking: Many think this is fine. I have heard people say, “We have plenty of churches.

There are churches all over the place that sit empty, why 236 the permanent revolution start new ones?

We don’t need more churches but better ones.” Can you imagine making such a statement about people? “We have plenty of people.

We don’t need more people, just better ones.

Why have more babies?” This is short-range thinking.

No matter how inflated you think the world population is, we are only one generation away from extinction if we do not have babies.

Imagine the headlines if suddenly it was discovered that 96% of the women in America were no longer fertile and could not have babies.

We would instantly know two things: this is not natural so there is something wrong with their health.

We would also know that our future is in serious jeopardy.22 This failure to think about and organize for the ability of ecclesia to reproduce lies at the root of much of our frustration with the persistent failure of so many church planting projects.

There are precious few thirdor fourth-generation church planting movements to be found.

And even when some churches manage to plant one or two new churches, they seldom last to the third generation, which is considered the beginning of real movement.23 This is partly because reproduction feels unnatural and the system is way too clunky to be able to easily reproduce.

Movements require commitment from the start in order to be selfgenerating.

All apostolic movements demonstrate this principle to varying degrees.

Self-Sustaining Anyone who has been in leadership very long realizes that finances have a massive impact on how we conceive of and carry out a church, a plant, or a mission project.

What few realize, though, is that the reasons are actually counterintuitive to what we normally think.

We generally think that the more money we give to a particular mission effort, the more chance it has of succeeding.

Actually the opposite is true.

Our assumptions once again come from the institutional paradigm of the church, which is building bound and expensive.

But that thinking marginalizes the real power of the church—the ministry of all of God’s people in every sphere and domain.

Church growth movement founder Donald McGavran warned in 1990: The congregation should be of such structure and pattern that common people can operate it and multiply it indefinitely among the masses.

In North America, the indefinitely reproducible pattern is not the highly successful church, led by a very exceptional preacher, apostolic architecture 237 which erects a set of buildings covering a city block and counts its members in the thousands.

That is one good pattern in certain situations, but it is impossible in most places.24 It is not possible to reproduce movementally, let alone sustain a movement, if churches require exorbitant amounts of money to start and operate.

Our friend and movement expert Steve Addison has long maintained that Christianity flourishes when it is no longer dependent on external organization, funding, and control.

He quotes missiologist Wayne Allen, who discovered that the impact of foreign subsidies for national church workers generally has an inverse relationship to the decline or plateau of the national churches.25 There are three reasons for this: Loss of lay involvement.

Subsidies resulted in a move away from lay leadership to a reliance on paid professional clergy.

Loss of focus.

Paid workers subsequently gave less attention to evangelism in unreached villages and more attention to meeting the needs of existing congregations in line with the expectation of the foreign mission agency providing the funds.

Loss of devotion.

As the people realized that the mission became funding their pastor, they lost a sense of ownership and came to see the pastor as the parent organization’s hired hand.

In turn, the hired pastor tended to give greater attention to pleasing the mission organization and seeking salary increases.26 The implications are profound for churches everywhere—not just the developing world.

If we hope to activate movements, we have to ensure that we do not lay the seeds of professionalism in the base models we use.

We need to keep an eye out for long-term sustainability and ongoing momentum.

Remember that every believer is an agent of the King, every son and daughter of the King is a missionary, and our Lord provides for each one in his own way.

This is not to say that monies should not be raised and some people paid through centralized sources, but serious care must be taken to avoid the perils that Wayne Allen outlined.

Movements must not be dependent on the availability or otherwise of clergy salaries; it is a sure way to stop a viable movement in its tracks.

Beyond the issue of money and support, sustainability needs to be able to be carried out by the whole church and not outsourced to experts or a priestly or pastoral caste that almost inevitably replaces and thus marginalizes the priesthood of all believers.

Furthermore, methods must be simple enough so they can be reproduced easily, rapidly, and sustainably.

Table 11.1 lists some examples of sustainable and unsustainable practices. 238 the permanent revolution Self-Reflective Local disciples and communities need to have the internal tools to analyze, reflect, learn, and adapt without having recourse to some central system that regulates what is, and is not, permitted.

Guided by a love for God, the presence of the in-dwelling Spirit, and a deep commitment to the scriptures, God’s people are able to make the right choices and grow to maturity on their own.

Besides, as we have seen in Ephesians 4, Jesus provided each church with APEST to ensure that they can stay true to their calling and can grow to maturity: “From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work” (Ephesians 4:16).

Missiologists have called this self-reflective ability “self-theologizing,” and it provides a basis of the fourth principle for framing movement organization: God’s people need to think contextually and interpret the gospel into their own particular context.

If they fail in being able to do this, they will fail to be a fully incarnated church—fully faithful to the gospel while at the same time being profoundly relevant to their culture.

When others do all the thinking for them, then people will never learn to think (and act) for themselves, and they will remain immature and dependent.

In movement thinking, each unit of the church has everything it needs to do its job, like the starfish.

Outsourcing basic functions, ones intrinsic to the viability of the church to be church, are usually well intended but prove to be utterly disastrous in the long run.

For instance, we believe that making a church dependent on external institutions to do its theologizing lies at the root of many of the organizational as well as the missional problems we face.

The denominational seminary is a classic case in point.

If one organization is set apart to handle all the ideas and leadership training, then the local church no longer believes it has to do the hard work of these itself.

As a result, it becomes lazy and dependent on the external organization.

If we are not careful, creating external training and licensing bodies can be a death knell to a movement and cultivate a propensity toward institutionalism.

If you doubt this rather controversial statement, consider this: prominent sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke, widely considered to be the premier sociologists of religion alive today, undertook a detailed study to track the remarkable growth and subsequent decline of the early Methodist movement.

Within decades of arriving in the United States in the 1760s, Methodism could claim to be discipling over 30 percent of the population throughout the nation.

All the elements of apostolic movement were evident in early Methodism; classes, small groups, apostolic organization, church planting, people movement, and so on.

The so-called circuit riders were a key factor in this success.27 These profoundly apostolic laypeople were passionate disciples who, with some rudimentary training, rode from town to town, planting churches as they went.

They would then circle back to ensure that the 240 the permanent revolution churches were growing and healthy.

Stark and Finke discovered that around 1850, the stunning growth turned into trended decline.

They discovered that during this period, the more institutionally inclined Episcopalians and Presbyterians had relentlessly mocked the Methodists as being uncouth and not knowing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

Under this barrage of insults, the Methodist leadership decided that the circuit riders should do rigorous seminary training at least equal to that of their antagonists.

The circuit riders were then required to do four years of seminary training as a prerequisite for licensing to the ministry.

Methodism in America has never regained a positive growth pattern lost in that fateful decision.28 This is by no means the only example.

An aspect worth considering is that the current training system was started and is still operated by the teacher and shepherd of the APEST typology.

One has to wonder what a system designed by and for a fully fledged APEST ministry would look like.29 What would change?

What would be the likely outcomes?

To produce something fundamentally different is going to require a thorough audit and recalibration of prevailing practices.

We should not be surprised, in constructing a theological training system (a tool) based squarely on variations of the Oxford-Cambridge model of theoretical academy-based learning, and subsequently requiring that all pastors should attend full time for at least three years to be ordained, that it should utterly change the most fundamental movemental algorithms that lie at the heart of biblical ecclesiology.30 We are not saying that education and learning are bad—far from it.

But requiring a formal, classroom-based degree as a necessary basis for ordination, a concept itself completely alien to the New Testament, violates the calling and ministry that Jesus has clearly given to every disciple and lends itself to a professionalized elitism that Jesus himself detested.

In addition, over the course of these programs, divinity students are socialized out of the context of leadership, ministry, and mission, anathema to movement dynamics because of the loss of needed momentum.
