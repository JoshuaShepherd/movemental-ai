## Appendix A: A Question of Legitimacy: The Restoration of the Apostolic Ministry

You can no longer remain unconscious where you slept before; one way or another, you are creating your future.

Wake up before you find that the devils within you have done the creating.

Stephen L.

Talbot It isn’t that they can’t see the solution.

It’s that they can’t see the problem. G. K.

Chesterton When she died on January 5, 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a wealthy widow of stature, left sixty coins to her church.

This money was to be used toward the purchase of a few stones that would start the construction of a community bell tower.

This building project was initiated by the local church leaders who decided they needed several new buildings in what they called the Field of Miracles. A year later, after digging a hole approximately five feet deep in soil composed of clay, sand, and shells, they laid the foundation and began what regrettably became a two-hundred-year building project beset by significant foundational issues.

The tower began to lean just after the third story was completed and continued to lean incrementally, yet sporadically, toward the south over the next seven hundred years.

Recent efforts to straighten the tower and keep it from falling over have varied from placing 960 tons of lead on the north side of the tower to removing earth beneath the north side of the foundation.

In June 2001, the tower had been straightened up approximately 16 inches, returning its position to what it was in 1838, about 13 feet off center.

Foundations for Authentic Ministry We think the Leaning Tower of Pisa is an appropriate metaphor for foundational aspects of the church’s function and ministry.

Foundations are just as vital to organizations (including churches) as they are to all other 256 appendix buildings and structures.

Shoddy work at the foundational level inevitably results in serious, and often disastrous, problems later.

Attention to the underpinnings of the church’s ministry and biblical foundations therefore is imperative.

And we believe that negligent inattentiveness to biblical foundations accounts for a number of the problems we face in being the church that Jesus intended us to be.1 We want to make clear that while we affirm the foundational ministries of Ephesians 2:20, we wholeheartedly acknowledge that Jesus is the one true foundation of the church and any attempt to build on any other foundation is rightly labeled heresy.2 There is a category difference between the Founder’s unique ministry and the subsequent work constructed on that foundation.

The work of the foundational ministries (apostle and prophet) is not to replace the role of the Founder, but to build on and so extend his ministry.

This is exactly how we should understand Paul’s passionate labors in Jesus’s cause and why he outright rejects any attempts by others to put him in Jesus’s place (1 Corinthians 1:11–24, 3:1–12; Colossians 1:24–25).

The fact that we have all but eliminated the possibility of an active, ongoing apostolic function from our consciousness and vocabulary, let alone from our practices, indicates that we have somehow messed with the foundations of leadership and ministry, at least in the way the New Testament church itself experienced these.

As we have seen, New Testament ministry clearly included the ministry of apostles and, beyond that, of APEST.

The words apostle and its derivatives are used over ninety-five times in the New Testament, whereas now apostle has been all but edited out of our vocabulary.

Whereas it is used only once to describe a function in the church, we use the word pastor as a catch-all title for just about every aspect of ministry.

And while the biblical understanding of teacher is circumscribed in the Bible itself (James 2), we refer to theologians as the sole dependable source of authority.

How can we account for such a massive discrepancy?

While accepting the ongoing role of the shepherds and teachers, we have to ask how it is we can claim to have a truly biblical understanding of ministry devoid of the active presence and participation of those who occupy the overwhelmingly prominent place in the biblical material itself.

This radical mismatch between New Testament APEST ministry and contemporary Western understandings serves only to highlight the issue that what we call ministry today is a substantively different from the original forms.

Either this delimitation of ministry to shepherd and teacher functions is what God intended, or it is not.

And if it is not what appendix 257 he intended, then we have made a terrible error along the way and must do all that we can to correct it.

Retrofitting the Church for Movement If the role of apostolic ministry is as we have suggested in this book—the apostolic person is the legitimate custodian of the genetic coding of the church—then it is easy to see that apostolic ministry is of vital importance for the life, ministry, and health of the whole movement.

And in fact we are unlikely to be able to fulfill our calling and mission as ecclesia without it.

Surely to miss this is to make a serious mistake.

We think that radical repentance is now needed to reestablish the church on its intended foundations.

The truth is that much of the traditional interpretation, undergirding the prevailing ecclesiology that pastors and theologians have scripted over the centuries, has seldom, if ever, been subjected to critical review and challenge.

In fact, in researching this book, we could not find much evidence of any real debate at all.

The fact that we have disputed issues as trivial as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but have managed to avoid this issue for so many centuries, ought to make one seriously wonder about our sanity.

The inherited position, undisputed as it is, is now assumed to be true; that is why one looks in vain for any significant exposition of the alternative in the standard commentaries and ecclesiologies that fill our shelves.3 Most suggestions that there is more to ministry than the standard forms meets with duration and rejection.

This is a clear case of the so-called Semmelweis reflex—where the work of Ignaz Semmelweis, in discovering that mortality rates in patients with infections could be reduced tenfold if doctors would wash their hands with a chlorine solution, was rejected by his contemporaries.

Here, the reflex-like denunciation of apostolic ministry and APEST is rejected because it contradicts entrenched norms.

Author and politician Upton Sinclair once said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”4 There is something disturbingly insightful in this statement.

The fact that most of the teaching determining apostolic legitimacy, or rather denying it, is generally produced by the very people who are most vested in the traditional arrangement should concern us.

We are not exactly getting an unbiased picture here.

Our academies are hardly intellectual centers for thinkers with distinctly apostolic leanings.

Quite the 258 appendix contrary, seminaries are the very bastions of the shepherd-teacher type of ministry.

And even if seminaries do not consciously intend it, their very purpose, their organizational bias, together with the self-selecting nature of the curriculum, tends to exclude the more generative (APE) types.

Consider the content of the standard courses for a master of divinity degree.

Comprising biblical studies, systematics, ethics, church history, pastoral studies, and perhaps spirituality, these hardly contribute to a study in apostolic ministry—or prophetic and evangelistic ministry, for that matter.

Besides, even if one were inclined to question this, it would be naive in the extreme to think that spiritual temperament, ecclesial politics, and an inveterate tendency toward organizational equilibrium do not play a major factor in upholding the inherited interpretations on the issue.

People dynamics are people dynamics, in the church and out of it.

Whatever historical factors have conspired to get us to this point, at the very least our current mission-critical situation in the West necessitates a serious reevaluation of the foundations as well as restoration of the kind of ministry that can effectively meet those challenges.

We believe that God has already provided for the church in the form of apostolic ministry.

And while Parts Two through Four positively describe the various aspects of this remarkable form of ministry, the rest of this Appendix will show some of the reasons how, and perhaps why, we ended up delegitimizing the apostolic gift in the first place.

From Movement to Monument: The Process of Institutionalization Paul could point to the foundational nature of apostolic ministry without the need for further explanation only because the role itself was patently self-evident in the Christian movement of his day.

Although at times he had to argue for the validity of his own particular apostolic calling, he never had to make an argument for the concept of apostolic ministry itself; it was universally accepted as being a vital part of what it meant to be church.

The very existence of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean was the direct result of apostolic ministry in the first place; it could not be denied.5 However, in spite of this clearly identifiable role in the founding and establishing of the early church, the apostolic function was increasingly marginalized as the movement grew and established itself over the next few centuries.

We believe that the reasons for this shift are not theological but rather arose from changing social conditions.

Contrary to what some would suggest, there are absolutely no textual grounds for appendix 259 the elimination of apostolic ministry from the church.

There is nothing in the New Testament itself to suggest that the APE ministries would, or should, be abrogated once the canon of scripture and the institution of the church were fully formed.

Whatever exegesis was used to justify this idea had to have imposed an extrinsic meaning on one or two selected texts (for example, Ephesians 2:20) and is a theologically anachronistic, politically motivated, procrustean reading to make the text suit the sensibilities of the later institution.6 We are saying that no case can be made from scripture itself; it came from elsewhere.

The process involving the restrictive narrowing of the fivefold ministry (and the apostolic) can be better explained by reference to social realities that eventually confront every religious (and human for that matter) movement over time: namely, institutionalization itself along with the battle to define what is to be considered orthodox and conventional.

Both of these key aspects are captured in what sociologists call the routinization of charisma—the process whereby the initial unique insight or experience (charism) of the founder is embedded or routinized into the very structures of the organization in the attempt to ensure that the organization itself survives the passing of its founder.7 The church followed the classic pattern that can be discerned in all organizations as they move from early stages to later development.

And all this in turn is part of the broader process of institutionalization.

While analyzing these sociological phenomena might seem somewhat abstract, and to the ears of pragmatic church leaders overly technical, it is no mere theory.

This self-same process is going on in your organization as we speak and has been doing so since it started.

We are wise to be alert to what is actually going on.

Furthermore, grasping these will help us appreciate how spiritual and organization renewal takes place.

Also, understanding these dynamics helps us to see how and why the more generative forms of ministry were marginalized from the movement and will continue to be so unless something intentional is done to guide the process in a more sustainable direction.

From Routine to Routinization The New Testament church was undoubtedly what we would call an organic, grassroots people movement with direct concerns relating to issues of community, organization, discipleship, and leadership.

And like all other human organizations, it was inevitable that they would seek to define social roles (elders and deacons, for example), proclaim what is valued and normative (ethics), create rites and liturgies, encode core 260 appendix beliefs, develop standards for discipleship, and build structures, all in the attempt to ensure the transmission of the message to generations that would follow.

In so doing, they were developing various institutions and traditions that were intended to help preserve the faith beyond the first generation.8 But as New Testament scholar James D. G.

Dunn notes, the result was creeping institutionalism, where ecclesia is increasingly identified with the external forms of the institution itself: Increasing institutionalism is the clearest mark of early Catholicism— when church becomes increasingly identified with institution, when authority becomes increasingly coterminous with office, when a basic distinction between clergy and laity becomes increasingly self-evident, when grace becomes increasingly narrowed to welldefined ritual acts ... such features were absent from first generation Christianity, though in [later] generations the picture was beginning to change.9 In these ways, the first movement sought to store and transmit the initiating energies of the movement and the charism of the Founder.

But they did not realize that the very process itself is fraught with such tragic consequences.

Ironically, it is Thomas O’Dea, a Catholic sociologist, who has best understood the nature of catalyzing encounters that kick-start movements that fade with the passing of time.

In his seminal work, he notes, “Worship is the fundamental religious response [to such encounters] but in order to survive its charismatic moment worship must become stabilized in established forms and procedures.”10 But he goes on to show that this desire to capture the sacred creates an unavoidable paradox for religious movements because the ultimate and the sacred cannot be contained in institutional structures without those structures taking on a life of their own and, in the end, corrupting what they were intended to preserve in the first place.

And so the tragic dilemma arises: without some form of institutionalization, remarkable religious experiences by themselves will not sustain long-term movement, but too much codification kills the movement as well.11 It is not hard to see how the apostolic ministry, with its strong association with founding impulses and, ironically, a participant in routinization, became one of the victims of the process itself.

While institutionalization as described can to varying degrees be seen as a normal process in any group, it had some hazardous effects on the ecclesia that Jesus intended in the first place—to be both agent and appendix 261 expression of the kingdom of God.

Like the Israelite attempt to store the manna in the desert, routinization of charisma is in the end an attempt to grasp the fading splendor of the God encounter and an effort to preserve it in priestly codes, ritual, and process.

As such, institutionalization easily slips into institutionalism.

And when it does, it inevitably creates problems because the institution will in the end tend to insert itself into the God relationship.12 Unchecked, institutionalization (along with routinization) easily regresses into a sinful endeavor to retain, control, and direct the initiating energy of the Christian movement.

In a word, it becomes an attempt to domesticate and mediate God.

But God, kingdom, Spirit, and gospel are much larger than any possible human codification can contain.

While these create the church, they cannot be contained within or simply identified with the church.

The church can simply be witness to these greater realities.

To claim otherwise is to make the church an idol.

Unregulated routinization also results in the institutionalization of grace that so characterizes the Christendom doctrine of the sacraments, where grace is captured in the sacrament, mediated only by ordained priests and restricted to the confines of the church’s internal organization.

In these conditions, the church will tend to take on an authority and importance that it was never intended to have.

This certainly proved true in later Catholic theology, where the church is viewed as the mediating institution between people and God and takes on a divine status.13 It is in this centuries-long process of encoding the initial charism into institution that somehow the dynamic energies of the apostolic ministry were apparently extracted from the apostolic persons themselves, routinized into the institution, and passed on ritually through the generations.

From Vocation to Manuscript Another (sub)routine in the overall process of routinization is the encoding of key ideas and values into the writings that emerge from dynamic movements.

Here too we can discern the supplanting of the apostolic vocation itself.

As movements encounter the problem of how they might preserve and propagate their unique message, they begin to generate manuscripts.

New writing and the new ideas associated with them are a sure sign that a movement is taking place.

Witness, for instance, the burgeoning literature sparked by the missional movement over the past few years or the social media phenomenon in the broader culture.

But the dilemma we face in 262 appendix the production of literature comes about because although we clearly need manuscripts, their production adds to the processes of institutionalization that become so problematic later.

The reason is that the writings, especially when divorced from the original context and abstracted from the called person, will tend to displace the people who started the movement in the first place.14 In other words, grand, universal ideas, divorced from particular life and biography, easily degrade into mere ideology.

And ideology in turn easily produces ideologues (partisan people who seek to impose ideas, or control others through ideas), who can become ruthless and controlling people; witness the Inquisition, Nazism, Islamic extremism, Christian fundamentalisms (to the left and right), or the Stalinist purges for good examples of the drive for ideological and institutional purity.15 Ideas are thus separated from the charisma and calling of the original generator of those ideas.

Rather than pointing beyond themselves to greater realities, they become important in and of themselves, and eventually take on a life of their own.

It would be like saying that in writing this book, we (the writers) become less important than the material we write.

We thus depersonalize the ideas, so they easily become an “it,” an object for our manipulation.

And here we have, albeit in embryonic form, the seed for the later concept of apostolic doctrine that, mediated through the religious institution and its doctrine, would eventually supplant the active role and presence of the apostolic person.16 The sad irony is that the production of official, defining manuscripts, combined with the other paraphernalia of institutionalization (apostolic succession, bureaucracy, and official cultus), comes at significant cost.

From Apostolic Calling to Apostolic Succession Routinization also explains how we arrived at the idea of apostolic succession in the first place.

This doctrine, held by some Christian denominations, asserts that properly ordained bishops were the chosen successors of the twelve apostles (particularly Peter) and that these bishops exist in direct continuity from the first-century bishops to the present day.

Hence, like some ecclesiastical nobility, those ordained by the bishops inherit spiritual, ecclesiastical and sacramental grace, authority, power, and responsibility, and they pass it on to others.

Thus is the line of succession secured from the first pope (understood to be Peter) to the current bishops and through them the clergy.

Although all but the most catholic of Protestant churches rightly reject this doctrine as highly erroneous, it does explain the very mind-set that gave rise to, as well as maintains, the marginalization appendix 263 of the apostolic function.

Apostolic succession was a direct way to try to supplant apostolic ministry, and in many ways it succeeded.

From Pneumatocracy to Bureaucracy When we track the work of the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts from Pentecost onward, we see that in almost every instance, it is seen to be energizing, legitimizing, or catalyzing the outward-bound mission of the church.

Here we see the disciples entrusted with the mission of Jesus moving beyond the narrow nationalistic confines of their temple theology and ethnocentric understandings of the gospel.17 And so the movement that flowed out from the epicenter of Jerusalem into global mission was inspired and empowered by the sending (apostolic) Spirit.

This leads us to conclude that the early church is what we might call a pneumatocracy—a people under the empowerment, rule, and guidance of the Spirit of God.

It is this uncontrollable pneumatic aspect of New Testament ministry that seems to fly in the face of the human urge to control.

And yet it is precisely this all-too-human attempt to determine our own destinies that lies at the root of organizations that so easily become ends in themselves.

This human struggle with pneumatocracy highlights the often vexing relationship between organizations and the people who lead them.

The general rule is that over time, vision and mission are increasingly downgraded in the name of management and administration.

In other words, increasing bureaucratization seems to be the rule.

As we have seen, this arises because as organizations grow through their life cycle, unless they are very intentional about it, they will almost always tend toward a state of equilibrium.

Following the ordinary course of events, organizations become increasingly internally focused and progressively more risk averse.

The felt needs of safety and security that subsequently dominate the community’s concern ultimately shape the kind of leadership the community seeks and validates.

And so the organization generates the type of leaders it thinks will best cater to the felt needs of the community in its devolving state.

Religious sociologist Peter Berger describes this phenomenon of bureaucratization: “Bureaucracies demand specific types of personnel.

This personnel is specific not only in terms of its functions and requisite skills, but also in terms of its psychological characteristics.

Institutions both select and form the personnel they require for their operation.

This means that similar [bureaucratic] types of leadership emerge in the various religious institutions, irrespective of the traditional patterns in this matter.”18 In other words movements, which are created by more generative types, increasingly 264 appendix become bureaucracies, which increasingly become self-selecting and selfreinforcing systems.

As a result, unless the leadership of the organization is intentional about resisting this deterioration with significant resolve, leadership will inevitably become increasingly bureaucratic in nature.

This trend is well documented and accepted in the field of social studies.

For instance, leadership consultant Lawrence M.

Miller has identified certain critical stages of the lives of organizations, businesses, and movements and the seven leadership styles that dominate during each stage.19 He notes that as the organization moves from being founded and led by the generative types (he calls them prophet, barbarian, builder/explorer, and synergist), power subsequently shifts to the more operative/maintenance type of leader (what he calls the administrator, bureaucrat, and the aristocrat).20 This squares well with our understanding of the exiling of the generative (APE) functions in favor of the more operative (ST) types.21 But as Berger indicates, when organizations become increasingly security oriented and more bureaucratic, they tend to suppress the more disturbing original message and mission that generated the organization in the first place. SUMMING UP.

Perhaps we can sum up institutionalization processes this way: although to some degree inevitable, it was not theologically scripted in the New Testament itself but rather has more to do with sociopolitical dynamics.

The eventual winners in this process of institutionalization rewrote the ministry codes as to what was considered acceptable or not.

The apostolic functions (along with the prophetic and evangelistic ones) were edited out of the codes.

The resultant Christendom system seldom demonstrated the motivation or the will (political, theological, or otherwise) to adjust it back to fit the biblical categories.

Not only was this exiling unnecessary and detrimental to the health of the movement, it lent itself to religious institutionalism that became the entrenched form of the church.

We illustrate the process of institutionalization in Figure A.1.

Our point in outlining this “movement-to-museum” aspect of church history is to show how the foundational, pioneering, translocal, and custodial leadership of the apostolic ministry was eventually eclipsed by the more local, increasingly maintenance-oriented leadership roles of bishops, elders, and deacons.

There irony is painful and costly: the local Christian communities (modalities) that owed their existence to apostolic pioneers (sodality) in the first place effectively rejected their apostolic heritage and thereby undermined their own capacity to generate and maintain authentic apostolic movements.

The chaordic dynamics of the early Jesus appendix 265 Generative leadership forms exiled Generative and Operative Operative leadership leadership forms forms movements were replaced by an often oppressive ecclesial system that was to become known as Roman Catholicism.

The Reformation, while rescripting our theology of salvation, failed to deconstruct the embedded Christendom paradigm of the church, and so it still rules the thinking of the vast majority of Protestant churches today.

Missiologist Ed Stetzer rightly points out, “When the Reformers (and later evangelicals) deemphasized the apostolic nature of the church, they inadvertently lessened the sending nature of that apostolic church.

The church that ‘reformed’ lost touch with the God who sends, and the mission of the church suffered.”22 And while we fully recognize that history is always more complex than what a diagram can convey, nonetheless this pretty much tracks the trajectory of the church from the more organic early forms to the much more institutionalized forms of Christianity associated with the Christendom paradigm.23 And sadly, this categorization fits all too well with the current decline of the European church.

In previous eras, Christendom retained complete dominance through its direct association with the state.

However, once the processes of secularization were introduced by the French Revolution and increasingly adopted throughout Europe, the church’s hegemony was broken, and it has been in decline ever since.

Apart from the basic fact that the church belongs to the Lord Jesus and that he will achieve his purposes in spite of us, the fact that Christianity in the West has at times grown at all can be traced to the all-too-brief emergence of generative forms of ministry and leadership that usher in new missional movements and the associated movements of renewal. 266 appendix In spite of the marginalization from the centers of ecclesial power in the church, APE types have been largely responsible for any real kingdom advance through the church: witness the work of St.

Francis, Count Zinzendorff, Ignatius Loyola, John Wesley, William and Catharine Booth, R. A.

Torrey, Alexander Campbell, Aimee Semple McPherson, and others).

God is still at work in his church, and the most fruitful aspects in terms of missional impact have most often come from so-called upstarts: people and movements that have been pushed to the margins of the church but have nonetheless been used by God to extend the kingdom and to bless the broader church.

Orthodoxy Versus Orthopraxy: How Apostolic Doctrine Supplanted Apostolic Practice Another distinctive feature that accelerated the institutionalization of the church, and the marginalization of the apostolic function along with it, was the effective substitution of impersonal apostolic doctrine for the active and living ministry of the apostolic person.

This process was grounded in distinct historical experiences as the burgeoning church engaged with nonbiblical worldviews.

As the Jesus movement began moving into the maintenance phase, the relative stability, along with the dominant needs of the day, initiated a shift in leadership type that favored a more distinctly theological-philosophical response to the threats of heresy together with a pastoral one to deal with the dissension that threatened to damage the integrity of the church.

The message of a crucified and risen messiah exploded onto the scene immediately after Jesus rose from the dead, and for approximately seven years, it managed to avoid any significant controversy related to the content of the message itself.

It was not until the conversion of the Gentiles that we see any substantial conflict about the gospel itself, along with its implications for missional expansion.24 This was to be the beginning of the many theological controversies for the Jesus movement in the first century.

The apostles subsequently dealt with issues of legalism, Jewish nationalism, asceticism, occultism, early Gnosticism, and various other ideologies and influences that found their way from the pagan religious and ideological context into the nascent communities.

Furthermore, as the Jesus movement expanded in the second and third centuries, churches were now almost exclusively non-Jewish in ethnicity and context.

As a result, the essentially Israel-shaped basis of Christianity was now confronted with a host of alien, extrabiblical ideas and doctrines all competing for dominance in the Christian mind.

Perhaps the major appendix 267 threat came from the Gnostic interpretations of Christ, but other issues relating to canon, authority, the nature of God, Trinity, and so forth also presented the fledgling underground movement with challenges.

Except for some bloodletting and name-calling, by and large the theologians handled the issues well, and the pastors kept the church pretty much intact.

But for obvious reasons, orthodoxy, understood here sociologically in terms of the codification and standardization of belief and behavior, became the driving concern for the church.

In order to survive these heretical threats, church leaders looked for a fixed, legitimate, and authoritative source of teaching.

Being rightfully viewed as the authoritative sources of the church, the writings of some of the original apostles (including Paul), became the cornerstone on which the New Testament canon would be built.

In this process of establishing the much-needed canon, we can also discern the roots of the later idea that was to become known as apostolic doctrine.

It was this understanding of the nature of doctrine itself that was later used to justify the eventual abrogation of the apostolic function itself.

By overlooking the critical functional role that apostles (as people) play in generating and sustaining movements, and believing that they had somehow successfully extracted the essence of their teachings, the church leaders at the time questioned whether apostolic ministry itself was still needed.

Clearly they concluded that it was not.

Like a caravan of intrepid explorers pioneering across the wilderness, the church did what might be expected when under attack: they circled their wagons and focused their energies on repelling the impending threats and keeping unity in the ranks.

But defensiveness, although necessary at times, ought not to be the church’s primary stance, at least not in the advancing church of Jesus Christ.

Jesus never intended that we be primarily a defensive agency but rather one on the offensive (Matthew 16:18).

As a pioneering voyage, it is a strategic mistake to allow a temporary interruption to undermine the fact that it is a journey after all, and that a journey is not over until the voyagers reach their destination.

The turning point was not so much that they had to circle their wagons—this is to be expected on occasions in all journeys of exploration.

The pivotal moment came when the kind of leadership needed for that crisis became the permanent definition of what legitimate leadership in the church looked like.

The expansive pioneers were exchanged for the more defensive home builders, and a different form of leadership began to dominate the consciousness of the church.

The die was thus cast.

But the shift in emphasis toward purely doctrinal issues and church conformity altered the trajectory of Christianity 268 appendix from being primarily conceived as a missionary movement with a transformative vision for society toward being a more defensive and selfreferential community of believers.

And so although the development of orthodoxy was clearly the right thing to do, the mistake was to throw the apostolic baby out with the bathwater as if the two could not coexist.

Certainly they had to this point—and to great effect.

Furthermore, we suggest that not only could they exist together, they actually should exist together.

That much is clear in the New Testament model itself.

The demise of the apostolic function tilted the leadership balance in favor of the operative (maintenance) types.

This also meant that the driving missional emphasis (embodied in apostolic ministry) was effectively displaced, with an ever-increasing emphasis placed on the role of doctrine.

Another result was the move away from the chaordic, decentralized networking associated with the movemental forms.

What we ended up with is all the increasingly centralized authority of bishops, who favored more bureaucratic, hierarchical, high-conformity forms characteristic of the Roman culture then and Christianity now.

None of this is indicated in the teachings of the New Testament itself.

On the contrary, the scriptures suggest an organically integrated ministry made up of at least fivefold forms, without which, we are warned, we cannot possibly mature.

And there is nothing to indicate that certain elements of the church’s ministry were to pass away while the others would abide forever.

Only a highly deductive and prejudiced reading of the New Testament can come to that understanding.

It was purely human choice, historical circumstance, and sociopolitical forces that determined this outcome.

We can no longer afford to delude ourselves into thinking that simply believing apostolic doctrine is going to be enough.

If theological ideas were enough to create a mature church and usher in the kingdom, it would surely have happened by now.

We have literally hundreds of millions of words of theology stored up in our libraries.

For too long, we have allowed ourselves to be deceived into thinking that because we advocate apostolic doctrine that we are somehow going to automatically be an apostolic church.

History has proven this to be patently false: having millions of theological books has not kept us from being profoundly heretical at times.

God save us from thinking that another volume of systematic theology is going to fix things up.

It is not that we do not believe in the power and necessity of good doctrine: we have already fully recognized the central importance of theology for the health of the church.

But doctrinal integrity is more than adequately provided for within the holistic fivefold ministry itself.

Apostolic custodianship over the genetic codes, the prophetic concern appendix 269 for covenantal faithfulness to God, the teacher’s rigorous commitment to understanding what has been revealed, the evangelist’s commitment to truth telling, and the pastor’s commitment to personal development and cohesion all collaborate to ensure that the Jesus movement stays on track.

Furthermore, if pastoral approaches alone could resolve the issue of the church, we should have gotten it after thousands of years of pastoral ministry.

Patently it is not enough: people are still hurting, we lack discipleship, the church is in long-term decline, many are bored, and most churchgoers complain that they do not get enough “feeding.” There is not a preaching series or counseling program in existence that will fix these.

Surely if that was the case, we would have had the solution by now.

Perhaps even improving pastoral and didactic programming adds to the problem by disguising the real dysfunctions in the system.

We do not suggest removing these ST influences, but simply complementing and supplementing them with more generative forms.

However we configure it, the situation of contemporary Christianity has utterly changed from that of the Christendom era, when the church completely dominated the religious and cultural landscape.

Not only are we experiencing what is legitimately called a post-Christendom, post-Christian culture, but we are in a situation where people are increasingly antagonistic to Christianity.

In other words, we are now back in a distinctly missionary situation, and although we still have some heresies to fight, the overwhelmingly strategic issue is the survival, let alone the advance, of Christianity in the West.

This requires a recovery of apostolic imagination and practice—nothing less.

Out from the Cold: The Return of the Apostolic If at an early stage and for various sociopolitical reasons, the church opted to expel the apostolic ministry (and the APE ministries with it), did it entirely disappear?

Did the vocation itself, as a calling by God, cease?

Clearly not.

Institutions, although they can delegitimize, cannot snuff out callings because they are ultimately derived from God, and God exists beyond any restrictions imposed by human will.

As a result, the influence of apostolically gifted people is clearly evident in every missional movement in the history of the church.

Along with the examples already given, here are some other more easily recognizable examples from all over the world:25 Columbanus, one of the key Celtic monastics, planted more than one hundred monasteries across Europe, which then sent thousands of church planters out across Europe. 270 appendix St.

Martin of Tours, known as the founder of Western monasticism, inspired the Celts to found missions and monasteries.

He is sometimes called the patron saint of Europe because of his passionate missional vision and work.

Saints Cyril and Methodius pioneered the mission to convert the Slavic peoples.

Saint Hilda, the abbess who hosted the synod of Whitby, played a major role in the extension of the Celtic movement.

Her apostolic influence extended to leaders, nobles, and kings.

Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, in his own lifetime had missionaries going to India, Japan, and South America, in addition to various parts of Europe.

His writings are thought to have partly influenced Wesley.

Henry Venn invented the now famous and profoundly apostolic three-self principles and influenced the development of indigenous missions just about everywhere.

Hudson Taylor’s work with the China Inland Mission is credited with laying the foundations for the growth of the Chinese church today.

Bishop Crowther is the first African bishop; he has indelibly shaped West African Christianity.

Joan of Arc was credited with bringing modern France into being. A very influential teen!

Mary Slessor was a remarkable missionary who deeply influenced the course of West African missions.

John Lake and P.

Le Roux are thought to have shaped most of African Independent Church development in southern Africa.

Nicholas Bhengu, referred to as the South African Billy Graham, personally planted more than one thousand churches and is thought to have inspired and fathered those who planted tens of thousands of churches.

Enoch Adeboya is the father of the fastest-growing denomination in the world today: the Redeemed Christian Church of God.

Aimee Semple McPherson was an outstanding female apostolic influence in early Pentecostalism.

She founded the FourSquare movement.

Gladys Aylward was a missionary in China whose exploits were made into a Hollywood blockbuster, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, starring Ingrid Bergman.

So much for the founders of massively influential movements.

But where apostles have managed to operate within the confines of the appendix 271 established churches, they have done so with minimal recognition and legitimacy, operating surreptitiously under the radar.

Other than that, they have been dormant within the community and have tended to express their gifting outside explicit ecclesial settings: in commerce, aid and development work, and other secular contexts where ideation, design, and entrepreneurialism are valued.

And so the official exile from the church is very real.

Those who do not fit the standard ministry profile are made to feel that there is something wrong with them or that they are of no value to the church.

When they assert themselves, they are easily labeled as recalcitrant or immature.

It is largely because of their impatience with the status quo that they are so labeled, but ironically (as we shall see) it is precisely this holy unrest that constitutes their distinctive gift to the church—contemporary or otherwise.

Evangelical Covenant Church missiologist Kyle J. A.

Small propheti- cally challenges the status quo of his denomination: Apostolic has a rich identity, offering both the commitment to God’s history, and a vision for participation in God’s future.

It is an actionoriented image rooted and centered in God’s larger story.

On the one hand, apostolic keeps to the inherited faith of the church.

On the other hand, apostolic means commitment to the edges.

Apostles refuse to leave any stone unturned and are willing to explore new ideas and territory.

Apostles yearn to see where God is acting in the world: even more, they invite the People of God to join them in these spaces.

Ordination becomes a living into addressing the leadership deficit that was first perceived in the Book of Acts The office of the apostle needs to continue today in the leadership of the church.

Ordained leadership needs to be recruited and formed with a disposition for apostolic imagination.26 And so the challenge stands.

We have huddled and cuddled, taught and preached, the church to near death.

It’s time to grow up!

It’s time to allow some holy chaos to enter so we can break loose from the iron cages of oligarchy and engage the missional challenge to extend the gospel in this century.

Inviting disequilibrium will help us deepen and broaden our understanding and practice of ministry in Jesus’s church. A recovery of apostolic gifting means that the church of Jesus Christ, in all its expressions, will begin to open itself up to a more missional, definitely more movemental, and, we hope, a more faithful future. notes ‌Foreword D.

Mike Breen is also considering updating his previous, somewhat more personal, reflections on this subject: The Apostle’s Notebook (London: Kingsway, 2002).

These will provide excellent corroboration with our book.

This prevailing paradigm is largely a by-product of the two-fold ministry structure of the shepherd and teacher.

We address this in the chapters in Part One, but for now we merely allude to the fact that the other three roles— apostle, prophet, and evangelist—have been effectively exiled from the ministry matrix of the church and therefore significantly alter our conception of what the church is and can be.

Introduction: The Crisis of Infertility and What to Do About It All the major research agencies report declining attendance and conversion.

The Pew Report, Barna Research Group, Ed Stetzer, and others are 274 notes in general agreement about the overall characteristics of this trend. USA Today ran an article in March 2009 that highlighted the research of the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) that gives a graphic interpretation of this trend: “The percentage of people who call themselves in some way Christian has dropped more than 11% in a generation.” To put this decline in perspective, the article said that “despite growth and immigration that has added nearly 50 million adults to the U.S. population, almost all religious denominations have lost ground since the first ARIS survey in 1990.” “Most Religious Groups in USA Have Lost Ground, Survey Finds,” USA Today, Mar. 17, 2009, http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/200903-09-american-religion-ARIS_N.htm.

Ahrend, In This Generation: Looking to the Past to Reach the Present (Colorado Springs: Dawson Media, 2010), p. 172.

The sobering truth is that this decline, along with the full potential of the future decay, set in when the church failed to reform itself in accordance with its greater mission.

Those who cannot deliver the transformational message of the gospel eventually will be forced to doubt the veracity of the message itself.

Theological and ethical doubt generally follows after operational doubt.

Not only is this missional trajectory inherently movemental, it is also exponential in nature.

The movement starts locally and mushrooms into a global phenomenon.

We recognize that Leon Trotsky also used the “permanent revolutionaries” phrase to describe the ongoing need for renewal in the communist notes 275 revolution.

In many ways, he was trying to incite the same capacity for ongoing development and renewal of the communist order.

Chapter One: Activating the Theo-Genetic Codes of APEST Ministry This is the clear-cut claim of one of my (Alan) books: The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos, 2007).

It proposes six elements that together create apostolic movements.

All six will be present in every movement that hits the power band of exponential growth patterns (such as that of the early church and China).

One of these relates to APEST, or fivefold, ministry.

If APEST is removed, a fully fledged apostolic movement is impossible.

There are nevertheless some excellent pieces of reflection in articles, books, and commentaries: Markus Barth’s commentary on Ephesians is one of them, as are an excellent piece by Darrell Guder, the short articles by Robert Clinton (they can be found on his Web site: http://jrclintoninstitute.com/), and some reflections by former Princeton seminary president John A.

Mackay in his book God’s Order (New York: Macmillan, 1957).

Doubtless there are more, but they are largely incidental pieces written as part of larger works on other topics.

Dowsett’s reflections on the missio Dei, kingdom of God, and Creation (on which he did his doctoral dissertation) helped him see that God was always preveniently involved in the world even before his church joins him in that mission.

Also, some distinct textual clues in Ephesians support this notion that it is a generic letter, intended to be circulated and read by multiple churches.

For example, elements that typically characterize many of Paul’s other letters are not included in the text.

Things like personal greetings, an axe to grind about a particular false teaching, and the addressing of specific problems uniquely related to a particular community, are all staple features of Paul’s letters, and yet they are curiously absent from Ephesians. M.

In relation to our use of the term vocation or callings, theologian Jack Deere states that apostleship is a calling, not a gift or an especially gifted or powerful person.

See his Surprised by the Spirit (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1993), pp. 242–243.

Many have argued that APEST actually constitutes a fourfold ministry because the conjunction between the shepherd and the teacher might indicate that this is the case.

We are not convinced from the text itself or from experience.

There are many teachers who are not pastors, and vice versa.

But, in fact, for our purposes, it does not matter at all.

Some readers may prefer to join the role of the shepherd to that of teacher, and that is fine with us It is interesting to note that Paul uses the verb form for the word truth in this verse.

It literally should read truthing.

The implications of the text lead us to believe that without the fivefold, we will access only a limited perspective on the faith.

Each of the APEST ministries offers a unique perspective on Jesus, thus enriching our overall understanding of Jesus and the gospel.

Paul addresses ethics and morals in the rest of Ephesians 4 and in Ephesians 5.

The word kataptismo has nuanced meanings because it is used to describe several activities that essentially achieve the same result.

The word is also used to describe the mending of fishing nets.

We will draw insight from this particular contextual use of the word later in the chapter, but the overarching meaning of the word has to do with adding aptitude or capacity to something.

Paul suddenly includes himself in the discussion here.

He moves from, “I urge you,” in 4:1 to, “But to each one of us,” in 4:7.

Paul is likely doing a play on words here.

He just listed the seven “one’s” and is now saying that each “one” of us has received something from the “one” Lord. notes 277 And he gave (didomi) some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some shepherds and teachers.

Ephesians 4:7, 11 But to each one of us grace (charis) was given (didomi) according to the measure of Christ’s gift (dorea) Ephesians 3:7–8 ... of which I became a minister according to the gift (dorea) of the grace (charis) of God, given (didomi) to me by the effective working of his power.

To me who am least of all the saints this grace (charis) was given (didomi), that I should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.

Grace, given, and gift are the same words that Paul uses to describe how God “graced” him with his apostolic ministry in Ephesians 3:7–8.

Notice the comparison between the texts: Once Paul gets to Ephesians 4, it is almost as if he is saying, “Yes, I received grace and a gifting from God, but I am not the only one.

Each one of us has received grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift.

Each one of us has received a ministry from Christ.” Paul then uses the same language of “each one” in verse 16 where he explicitly says “From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.” Paul brackets his entire discussion of APEST with distinctively inclusive language.

For a random sampling of the word in the New Testament, see Matthew 16:27, 18:35; Luke 16:5; Acts 2:8; Romans 14:12; and Hebrews 6:11. M.

These roles typically evolve into an official position within the movement and contribute to the process of institutionalization through the creation of offices and a centralized leadership structure.

We discuss how APEST does this in Chapters Two through Four.

For now, we only want to draw attention to the fact that the text makes this claim about APEST.

Some scholars believe that the gift of prophesy mentioned in Romans 12 has more to do with preaching, or proclaiming the word, rather than miraculous revelations or prophetic utterances.
