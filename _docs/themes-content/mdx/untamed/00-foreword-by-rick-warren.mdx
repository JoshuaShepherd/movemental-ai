# Foreword

A generation ago a well-known English bishop ruefully admitted, “In the New Testament, everywhere Paul went he sparked a revolution. But today, everywhere I go, they just serve tea and crumpets!” Sadly, this expresses a fundamental problem in many churches. We’ve become tamed by tradition, captivated by culture, and controlled by our desire to fit in, not make waves, and never offend anyone. We’ve been domesticated instead of being discipled.

In the Great Commission Jesus commands us to "go and make disciples of all nations," but we can't make disciples until we are disciples. We can't make a difference until we are different. This requires us to return to the Jesus model of disciple making. Thirty years ago, when Kay and I planted Saddleback Church, we began imitating the intentional and sequential discipleship process Jesus used with his twelve. Like Jesus, we move people from "come and see," through all of the same stages Jesus used, to "come and die." Because of our emphasis on radical discipleship, we have baptized over 28,000 new adult followers of Christ, grown them to maturity, and sent over 10,000 of them to serve in all 195 nations of the world. You can't improve on Jesus!

Surveys and polls reveal that in many countries, the lifestyles of believers are not very different from those of nonbelievers. Too many Christ followers have settled for living a nice, comfortable, moral, and decent life instead of following the radical and wild adventure of trusting God’s promises and obeying his commands. Fortunately, Alan and Debra have written just what needs to be said. Untamed is a desperately needed shot of spiritual adrenaline into our mild-mannered and mediocre attempts at following Christ.

The starting point is to get a new vision of who God is, how he acts, and what he expects from us. In Untamed you will discover a wild God, a God who loves us so much he dove into humanity headfirst. He didn’t play it safe, and he expects you to take risks in faith also.

In these pages you are about to read, Alan and Debra will carefully and clearly lead you to truly transforming discipleship. They lay out the path, expose the pitfalls and obstacles, and show how to stay on the road until you reach the finish line. As you get serious about following an untamed God, you will begin to enjoy the untamed lifestyle of being radically committed to Christ’s mission in the world. Your Father in heaven created you for this, Jesus saves you for this, and the Holy Spirit empowers you for this! This is your destiny.

In C. S. Lewis's Narnia stories, the children were worried about their first encounter with Aslan, the great lion who represents Jesus. Susan asks, "Is he safe?" Mr. Beaver replies, "Who said anything about being safe? 'C ourse he isn't safe! But he's good, and he is the King." Aslan was far from being tamed and housebroken. But he was good, and just, and strong enough to defeat evil. Once the children met Aslan, they began the adventure of their lives.

It is my prayer that the same will happen to you as you read this book. Jesus loves you just the way you are, but he loves you far too much to let you stay that way.

Rick Warren
