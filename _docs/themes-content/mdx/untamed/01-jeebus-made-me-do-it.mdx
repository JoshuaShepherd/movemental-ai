# Section One: The Untamed God

> The great Christian revolutions came not by the discovery of something that was not known before. They happen when someone takes radically something that was always there.

> In a hilarious episode of The Simpsons called "Missionary Position," Homer Simpson promises PBS he will donate money to the network if they will stop their fundraising efforts. The episode, in which Homer travels to a remote South Pacific island as a missionary, is generally credited for saving the television network.

However, it quickly becomes apparent that Homer does not have the money, prompting a mob of characters and personalities from various PBS shows to chase him through the streets. He hides out in the First Church of Springfield and bargains with Reverend Lovejoy who, despite Homer's obvious lack of Christian faith or understanding, packs him off as a missionary to the South Pacific. Just as the plane is about to take off, Homer shows his utter ignorance when he anxiously exclaims, "Jeebus? Jeebus? But I don't know Jeebus! Helllp me Jeebus!" Homer arrives on the island where he meets the natives.

At first he is so fearful that he’s about to be eaten for dinner, he drops to the ground crying “Oh God!” repeatedly. The natives take him for a religious mystic and so they too fall to the ground crying out to God. Emboldened by his new status as spiritual guru, Homer begins trying to teach them about religion, but realizing that he knows nothing about it, he tries something new. While the natives were noble savages ignorant of and unspoiled by civilization, Homer decides to build a casino on the island, which he names “The Lucky Savage.” This introduces alcohol, gambling, and violence to the island and totally ruins the natives’ previously virtuous way of life.

We start the chapter with this story because it highlights the impact of how ignorance of Jesus by those who claim his name is toxic to both the believer as well as those around him or her. Following “Jeebus,” Homer wreaked utter havoc on the population, and we are left wondering if this does not describe large tracts of Christian history equally well. Now we of all people do not want to say that God doesn’t use the odd Homers of this world (we think the church should be a freak collection and that God does use weirdos of all sorts), but it does highlight the fact that the missional disciple must know God in a real way or else bear false witness. And given our previously mentioned commitment to a distinctly missional form of Christianity, this chapter will highlight some of the ways ignorance of Jesus (willful or otherwise) creates a toxic religion that is not only not worth spreading, but detrimental to the cause of Christ.

## God Is Like Jesus

The first and absolutely most foundational thing we can say in a book about missional discipleship is that it must be based squarely on the founder of the Christian faith—Jesus the Messiah. And while this might seem obvious, one can easily be excused for not being able to recognize anything approximating Jesus in some of the people who claim his name. This discontinuity between Jesus and the religion that claims his name, what Jacques Ellul calls the "subversion of Christianity," has led countless people to say with political humorist Bill Maher, "I don't know anyone less Jesus-like than most Christians." It also prompted researchers David Kinnaman and Gabe Lyons to write a book called unChristian, which is based on what most non-Christian twentysomethings said about so-called Christians.^1 Jesus is the key not only because Christian discipleship is about becoming more like Jesus but also because it is only in and through Jesus that we can get the proper, truly Christ-ian understanding of God. In other words, Jesus gets defining rights in relation to life, discipleship, theology, and everything in between.

New Testament scholar Albert Nolan is quite right when he states:

> By his words and practice, Jesus himself changed the content of the word "God." If we do not allow him to change our image of God, we will not be able to say that he is our Lord and our God. To choose him as our God is to make him the source of our information about divinity and to refuse to superimpose upon him our own ideas of divinity. This is the meaning of the traditional assertion that Jesus is the Word of God. Jesus reveals God to us; God does not reveal Jesus to us.... We cannot deduce anything about Jesus from what we think we know about God; we must deduce everything about God from what we do know about Jesus.... To say that Jesus is divine does not change our understanding of Jesus; it changes our understanding of divinity.^2

Reclaiming the centrality of Jesus will help us avoid the perennial mistake of superimposing upon the life and personality of Jesus our preconceived ideas of what God is supposed to be like. N. T. Wright affirms this when he says:

> My proposal is not that we know what the word "god" means, and manage somehow to fit Jesus into that.

This is what God seeks to do. Jesus wars against spiritual forces that oppress people and resist God's good purposes. This is what God does. Jesus loved people others rejected—even people who rejected him. This is how God loves. Jesus had nothing but compassion for people who were afflicted by sin, disease, and tragedy. This is how God feels. And Jesus died on the cross of Calvary, suffering in the place of sinful humanity, defeating sin and the devil, because he passionately loves people and wants to reconcile them to God. This is how God saves.^4 It is true that Jesus is like God, but the greater truth, one closer to the revelation of God that Jesus ushers in, is that God is like Jesus!

## We Become What We Worship

Focusing our discipleship on Jesus forces us to take seriously the implications of following him, of becoming like him... like God. The spiritual agenda for discipleship is thus set: Jesus is our primary model, teacher, guide, savior, and Lord. He is the standard by which we assess discipleship and spirituality.

And we must become living versions of him—little Jesuses.^6 So, if we want to know what God is like, we need to look no further than the person of Jesus Christ. Now while this may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say, it is staggering how few of us really integrate this most fundamental of truths into our lives. Recently one of us was reminded of this reality when attending a local Bible study. The group was studying a book on the character and attributes of God. The leader of the group was asking whether God was knowable, and if so, how we can really know him. The participants were caught up by the "otherness" and "awesomeness" of God experienced in worship, and seemed to sit more comfortably talking about this. It wasn't until the study leader stated that it was Jesus who shows us who God is, and that we know God in and through him, that the people seemed to make the connection. What is interesting is that these highly intelligent, mature men and women had been going to church most of their lives, and yet they missed this primary fact—the Jesus factor.

That there is a radical disconnect between God and Jesus for many believers, as illustrated in the story above, shouldn't surprise us. For most people it is far easier to sit with the "otherness" of God—we prefer our divinity at a safe distance.

But while God’s transcendence does, and should, instill feelings of awe and a desire to worship within us, it does not immediately show us a way to follow. We see God or read about him and stand in awe. But what then are we supposed to do besides worship and adore him? When confronted with the reality of God in Jesus, God in human flesh, God is no longer beyond and unfathomable, but immediate and present.

He has come close to us, and his claim on our lives becomes somewhat more unavoidable. That was the whole point of the incarnation.

Jesus or Jeebus?

Voltaire once noted that God created us in his image... and that we returned the favor. Following this logic, we say, “Show us your Jesus, and we’ll show you who you are.” This challenge poses quite a shocking reality check for all of us, for the sad fact is we have made Jesus look a lot more like us than we would care to admit. We have cut Jesus down to size, made and repackaged him into an image of ourselves on a good day and at our best. Now to be fair, it is hard for any of us not to do this to some degree.

This struggle is, and should be, intrinsic to our discipleship.

The fact is, we need Jesus to be like us, for if he isn’t, we doubt whether he can possibly understand who we are and what our human experience is like. An example of this is a crucifix we purchased in Africa which hangs on one of our walls. It portrays Jesus as a black man. All of us have a deep need to know that Jesus identifies fully with us. But to be honest, we can easily overbalance this identification and end up with an image of Jesus that is a far cry from who he really is.

Whenever we visit a European city, we usually do three things. Like most Christians, we visit some churches. We also visit, because of our respective backgrounds, the Jewish and the gay areas which, strangely enough, coexist in the same areas of most cities. One of the interesting things we have noted is the contrast between the churches and synagogues.

They are strikingly different. The synagogues are usually sparse and unadorned, with absolutely no icons or images; the churches, on the other hand, are usually overly adorned, with icons and images on every wall and altar. It seems to us, historically at least, that Christians have a propensity to create icons and images of God, even though the very creation of an image of God (mental or metal) limits him and can easily become an attempt to control him.7 The Jewish people seem to have learned the lesson of the second commandment better than us (Exod. 20:4).

On a recent trip to Vienna, we followed our normal pattern, visiting churches et cetera, when we happened across a very big painting of Jesus hanging in the oldest church in Vienna.

What struck us about this particular portrait was that Jesus looked strikingly like the average Austrian male, albeit a somewhat more emaciated one (we can't have Jesus too chubby can we?). The artist made a deliberate and successful attempt to connect his depiction of Jesus with the nationality of the people. Like we said, that is kind of a good thing—he does lovingly identify with Austrians—but image-making comes at a cost. We left the church wondering, What if this Jesus on the cross looked more like the all-too-Jewish carpenter he really was? Would the Austrians in World War II have so eagerly participated in the slaughter of Jewish people in the Holocaust if their Jesus looked more explicitly historical, and therefore Jewish? And if, in this case, he has simply become a purely Aryan Jesus, was this the real Jesus at all or simply an idealization of Austrian religious values—a quasi-religious, nationalist idol? These are probing questions that should highlight for us the inherent risk in making any image of God and, by extension, Jesus. It seems we often end up with some sort of "Jeebus" who simply affirms our many cultural blind spots and engenders dangerous bigotry. Jesus is reinterpreted in the light of my image and thus becomes a symbolic representation of me/us when we are at our best. We are projecting our self-concern onto God, and it ends in co-opting God to serve our agendas. He becomes a national god, a projection of our collective or individual hopes, a focal point of our narrow concerns, or simply a projection of "me" on a good day. Not a good look!

In ReJesus, Alan and Michael Frost spend a lot of time dealing with this very issue: our need and propensity to create Jesus in our own image. The early chapters of that book are dedicated to freeing Jesus from the stained-glass prisons and domesticated images we have locked him in. Afew are pertinent:

- Spooky Jesus: the bloodless alien with an aura and his pumping heart in his hand, which, it should be noted, violates the very meaning of the incarnation—all humanity is bleached out

- Bearded-lady Jesus: portrays Jesus in an overly sentimental and feminine way, kinda like he's just been done over by the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy gang just before he gets on the cross

- Little baby Jesus: made famous in the movie Talladega Nights, drawn from the harmless stereotype rolled out at Christmastime to make us feel all schmaltzy about our families

- Jesus is my boyfriend: the over-romanticized understanding of Jesus typified in much of the contemporary, touch-me-Lord-type songs we sing

- Jesus the celebrity rock star: typified in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Jesus Christ Superstar, in which Jesus doesn't quite know what he's doing, but he loves to sing about it

There are many ways we have re-created Jesus in our own image, and the above parodies are but a few. Even the artistry of icons focuses on an aspect of Jesus and thus limits who he is. Did he really have a blazing aura around his head and assume the hand gestures of a kung fu master? Just a little probing will identify that we all have the capacity to create our own version of Jeebus.

In much of our image-making, we have sought to domesticate Jesus and make him a much more manageable lowercase- “l” lord that comfortably legitimates our lifestyle. Let’s be honest: for many Christians, Jesus has come to look and behave like a nice, regular, high-conformity, somewhat-morally upright/uptight churchgoer. Is this really the wild Messiah we encounter in the Gospels? Is this the One we love, follow, and seek to be like? Really? Surely not! It is us who must become like him, not he like us.

“Wow, Jesus! You look and sound just like me!” It is important for each and every one of us to be able to access Jesus, and feel that he can identify with us and us with him. But we have to tread carefully indeed so we do not end up with an idolatrous predicament—a “Jeebus” of our own making—very far from the God in Jesus as revealed in the Scriptures. The world would reap the consequences of our false witness. the untamed god Limp-wristed versus ultimate-fighting Jesus As we can see, getting to grips with Jesus is not an easy task.

As soon as we try to “image” him, we limit him. In fact, many attempts to make an image of God are actually a way of trying to control him—it’s that annoying second commandment again! And we believe this commandment always applies to God, the three persons of the Trinity—it is not just limited to the God of the Old Testament. How is it that we so easily disregard it? If we can learn anything from the story of Israel, we discover that any attempt to limit or stereotype him will fail because image-making always fails (see footnote for an explanation of what we think about art and image).8 Arecent example of reimaging Jesus was supplied by Seattle pastor Mark Driscoll. He has become somewhat infamous for his portrayal of Jesus as some sort of ultimate fighter. But in attempting to “butch up” Jesus and make him appeal to “real men,” has Driscoll come close to creating Jesus in his own image? Consider this assessment of one of his sermons:

Latte-sipping Cabriolet drivers do not represent biblical masculinity, because real men—like Jesus, Paul, and John the Baptist—are dudes: heterosexual, win-a-fight, punchyou-in-the-nose dudes. In other words, because Jesus is not a limp-wristed, dress-wearing hippie, the men created in his image are not sissified church boys; they are aggressive, assertive, and nonverbal.9 Now we don’t believe Mark’s original intention was bad.

What he was trying to do is rescue Jesus from the overly feminized ways in which Jesus has been portrayed. We would agree and also want to rescue the image of Jesus from this.

In fact, in ReJesus, Alan and Michael talk about this exact issue, the over-feminization of Jesus.10 But the problem with Driscoll’s ultimate-fighting Jesus is that Jesus has been freed from one distortion only to be captured by another.

It cannot but be a distortion. Is Jesus really some “punchyou-in-the-nose-type dude”? And is that really the model and type of Christlike masculinity to which every man should aspire? We think not. Is this parody of masculinity not actually the source of so much gratuitous violence in the world?

Besides, if Driscoll is right, then the incarnate God-Man’s capacity to identify with the human race, most of whom are not variations of Arnold Schwarzenegger, nor want to be, is severely limited (and quite honestly—no offense, Arnie— that would be repulsive). Christianity Today commentator Brandon O’Brien rightly says, “I don’t gauge my masculinity by the girth of my neck, and I’d rather not sweat for a living.

I’m happiest when I’m reading and writing. I like lattes.”11 And as for Jesus being “nonverbal,” we find this statement difficult to reconcile with the fact that Jesus is called the “living Word.” The Gospels are filled with conversations Jesus had with people in his path. Not to mention the fact that God has been communicating with us through the use of language since the beginning of creation.

Let’s tease this out a bit to probe how stereotyping Jesus seriously damages the church’s life, mission, and witness.

As mentioned in the Introduction, our community became a home for many homosexually oriented men and women.

Many of the men were more "effeminate" in their mannerisms—what Driscoll mockingly calls "limp-wristed." Our question is, Where is the space for men who, through no fault of their own, are more effeminate than Driscoll's adaptation of Jesus? Dare we say there isn't any—they simply get the message that they are unacceptable to Jesus as they are. But this strikes a blow against the gospel itself! Does Jesus not love these people unconditionally and accept them into his family? Or does his love require that they should become macho and straight before they can become believers? All this highlights our point that Jesus must not be made into something he is not. How does a gay-oriented, effeminate man relate to a "punch-you-in-the-nose-type dude"?

> A story of a close friend who became a vital part of our community comes to mind. Matt (not his real name) was a gay man actively involved in the gay community. He was, like many others, searching for love and meaning in a pretty reckless life full of drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll (or in his case, dance music). He was looking for that "perfect man" who would fulfill all of his hopes and dreams.

Fortunately for Matt, he did eventually find that perfect man, but it certainly was not the man he thought he would find.

Matt found Jesus!

At the time, Matt was a waiter and worked with other gay men in an inner-city restaurant in Melbourne, Australia.

He encountered Jesus at Eastertime. He recalls going back to work after the Easter break and being questioned by his gay friends about why he was not at the gay bars and out partying with them over the holiday. They assumed he had found a guy and were full of questions about the new man in his life. When asked to tell them about him, Matt replied, “Well he is Jewish, he is a carpenter, he’s really spiritual,” and so on, at which point the guys excitedly asked, “Well then, what’s his name?” Matt said at this point he knew he was in trouble. When he replied “Jesus,” their jaws dropped; they were stunned.

We tell this story because in Jesus, Matt, living as a gay man, had found the perfect “lover.” He used to say, “Jesus will never use and abuse me nor will he ever leave me.” Jesus became for him, as he is for all of us, the perfect man. Of course, it wasn’t sexual; it was a relationship about receiving love and loving in return. Through his relationship with Jesus, Matt was able to experience true, unconditional love from a man in a way he had never experienced before.

If we want to insist on portraying Jesus as a kind of violent, gun-toting trucker, then we should consider not only the impact on the gay community, and on the many other men of a different ilk, but also on women. And how the church has historically treated women is nothing less than shameful!

To get the right view of Jesus is profoundly important both for mission and discipleship, particularly when ministering to those who don’t fit our cultural stereotypes. Jesus must be freed in order to relate to all people; if he isn’t freed, the incarnation fails to make sense. Jesus refuses to be put into any of our boxes. He doesn’t—and never will—represent one individual over another, or the majority of the population over the minority. As the Archetypal Human, he represents us all. And we all need to be able to identify with Jesus. T

What Kind of Holiness Is This?

We must now come to the question of how we understand Jesus missionally. And to do this, we simply have to recover the sheer power of his humanity. We must again be surprised by the amazing capacity of Jesus to break religious stereotypes and embody a kind of holiness that embraces the seriously weird and the wonderful along with those considered “mainstream” or “normal.” Aquestion we pose is this: What is it about the holiness of Jesus that caused “sinners” to flock to him like a magnet and yet managed to seriously antagonize the religious people?

This question begs yet another, even more confronting question: Why does our more churchy form of holiness seem to get it the other way around—to comfort the religious and antagonize the sinners? Jesus's brand of holiness (the true form) didn't seem to deter the sinners from wanting to get up close and personal with him. The Gospels are full of stories of sinners, the bungled, the broken, and the bent clamoring to be near Jesus. Jesus was different. He wasn't like the other holy rollers, the religious folk of his day. There was something magnetic about his persona that caused even the most desperate to do the unthinkable and violate not only the social etiquette of the day, but risk further marginalization by being close to him. Think of the story of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25–30). She knew, as did everybody else, that her particular condition required a strict separation from the community and that "holy" ones should avoid all contact with people like her. And yet this holy man exuded something that caused her to reach out and touch him.

No doubt about it, Jesus’s holiness was compelling. The Gospels clearly show us that social rejects loved to be around Jesus. Think of prostitutes, lepers, tax collectors, adulterers, Roman soldiers, Samaritans, Gentiles, and the list goes on.

They couldn’t get enough of him. By hanging out with people like these, Jesus shows us that one cannot achieve holiness by separation from the unclean. As previously mentioned, our community at South became something of a refuge for similar types of people—prostitutes, schizophrenics, and the like—and we know from personal experience that they don’t generally like Christians. How can they love Jesus and so dislike his followers? Surely if we were Christlike they would like to be around us as well. That they don’t should disturb us.

The even more amazing thing is that not only did the social outcasts and sinners want to be around Jesus, but Jesus wanted to be around them! This was the whole purpose of Jesus’s mission, to save “sinners” (Luke 19:10), and he practiced active proximity with them (more of this in another chapter). Jesus the Holy One often went out of his way to connect with, or be seen with, those who the “holy ones” of the day would never have even thought of entertaining.

The holiness of Jesus, it seems, is a redemptive, missional, world-embracing holiness that does not separate itself from the world, but rather liberates it.

And it wasn’t that Jesus was simply “a nice inclusive guy.” Everyone loves a nice guy, but nice guys don’t end up murdered on crosses. Actually, as Ben Witherington notes, “It is no surprise, in view of his teachings and actions, that Jesus was crucified. What is surprising is that it did not happen sooner.”12 His radically embracing brand of holiness was thoroughly confrontational to all, especially the religious elite, the “separate ones.” The term prophetic captures what we mean here because it called for a radical, redemptive holiness that went way beyond mere morality. B

## Untamed holiness

One of the greatest counterfeits for following the untamed Jesus comes from the substitution of morals and decency for Jesus’s untamed kind of holiness. One of the standard attempts to stereotype, and therefore domesticate, Jesus is to make him into a moral teacher, someone who taught us how to live decent, rule-based lives. He was much more dangerous and subversive than that. He was more of a prophetic nonconformist than a tame ethics teacher. And whatever “ethics” might be gleaned from his teachings must be radically reinterpreted through his person, his wildness. We cannot separate the person from what he taught without seriously distorting what he was about. He calls people to throw everything away to follow him (Matt. 13:44), to a cross (Matt. 10:38; 16:24), to a love for God that will make all other loves seem like hatred (Matt. 10:35–37). This was no divine ethics lecturer speaking! His was a wild holiness that called to account all those who refused to deal with God—those who preferred instead to follow the lame dictates of a religion of ethical codes and pious rituals. Greg Boyd is correct in his assessment: The church as a whole does not look like the body of Christ, whose outrageous love attracted people who would otherwise have had nothing to do with a “religious establishment” or “ethical system.” We don’t generally have tax collectors, prostitutes, and other sinners (not former tax collectors and former sinners) the untamed god in our company (Mark 2:16). Rather, despite our own insistence that it is not so, we often look like a body of Pharisees whom sinners—people with certain kinds of sin we’ve identified as more serious than our own—avoid at all costs.13 Deb tells the story of when she was preaching on John 8, where Jesus encounters the woman caught in adultery. Her point was that Jesus has a certain way, or order, in which he communicated to this woman, the “sinner” of the story. In his remarkably inclusive and gentle way, he spoke words of acceptance first, not condemnation. It was only after his acceptance of her that he then exhorted her to go sin no more, understanding that it is God’s acceptance of us that will ultimately lead us to repentance. F

Grace must be introduced into the equation from the very beginning of the relationship and we, being his followers, should do likewise in our relationships with non-Christian “sinners.” Deb then went on to explain that we Christians tend to reverse the equation: we will accept people only once they repent. At the end of the sermon, a woman came up to her and thanked her for the message, but indicated very quickly she was glad that Deb mentioned Jesus did say to the woman, “Go and sin no more.” She had missed the whole point! In fact, she actually demonstrated what Deb was saying. We so easily focus on the sin-morality side without the grace-love side of the equation.

Truly did Stanley Hauerwas say that our ethics derive from what we have seen of God.14 To experience the radical grace of God in Jesus is to change—to miss grace is to miss the whole point! Love, and not detached morality, is the fulfillment of the law (Rom. 13:8).

We believe many Christians likewise tend to regard sin simply as acting immorally or unethically, and see an ethical life as the highest goal for a human being. But this is not the biblical view of discipleship because it substitutes duty to ethics in place of our primary duty to God. It is about relationship, not rules and regulations. It is far more convenient (and safe) to deal with rules than with God. Morality unconnected to the source of morality yields the cold, sad, judgmental self-righteousness of moralism.

## Rules = conformity

Following rules generally requires high levels of conformity, be it to the state, the community, or even the church.

But conformity to these necessary social institutions does not necessarily equate to faithfulness to God. One can live a morally upright life while leaving God entirely out of the equation. This is a dangerous and idolatrous shift because, once we are at this point, any idea that there really is a duty to God simply evaporates, and all we are left with is the oppressive idols of rules and law-keeping.15 The Pharisees of the New Testament are a case in point: they were rule keepers who, for the most part, were far from having a personal relationship with God. Paul also constantly warns us about self-righteousness and teaches us to see ourselves as ones who receive our righteousness as a gift from God. He tells us to live in conformity to God, not to rules. We should be clear about the New Testament teaching on this: any attempt to live a self-righteous life based on morality (“the law” in Paul) always ends in religious despair because it can’t save us. C

In fact, if we are going to be genuinely Christlike, we will not be conformists! For one, our Lord can hardly be called a conformist. He disturbed the status quo, railed against injustice and lack of mercy, hung out with highly questionable people, and fomented a revolution that called for the overthrow of religious oppression. He put Rome on notice that its time was coming. How can we who model ourselves after Jesus be any different?

Peter Vardy, a British philosopher who has studied the writings of that wild disciple Søren Kierkegaard, says:

> All too often the domains of society and conformity, the social expectations that come from raising children, setting up home and the like, become a substitute for individuality in the God relationship. This [Kierkegaard] sees as a travesty of the Christian demand. He blames this on priests and the general wish for mediocrity. There is a demand by "the crowd," the mass of people, to live an ordinary, unexamined and passionless life in which God is essentially irrelevant, and yet they want this life to be regarded as Christian.^16 As uncomfortable as this makes us feel, we should listen to what is being said. Groupthink is not necessarily a Christian virtue, and we should not mistake a crowd for a community of Christ followers! People can easily hide from God in a crowd; crowds are great for dodging God. In truth there is real potential for evil in masses of people—witness a mob, for instance. If we are not careful, churches can easily develop a herd mentality, a crowd instinct that will tend to penalize dissenting voices and actions. T

## The Christian Thought Police

Dirty Jesus?

Darryl Gardiner (our good friend from New Zealand) doesn’t mince words. While he is a brilliant communicator and missional activist, he is not exactly known for being polite or well mannered! One year, at our Forge “Dangerous Stories” summit, he spoke about connecting with the “Dirty Jesus.” In his usual hard-hitting style, Darryl worked his way through some of the Gospels, “dirtying” Jesus up as he went. He unapologetically claimed that the more tame and sanitized our Jesus is, the less he resembles the Jesus of the Gospels, and this in turn has a big impact on the way Christians live out their faith. Asanitized Jesus is a misrepresentation of him and leads us to live sterile lives.

Both of us confess to having been mildly uncomfortable at times with his message, and the audience even more so. But the more we thought about his words, the more we realized that what he was saying was actually exactly right. The fact is, there was not much about the birth, life, and death of Jesus that was particularly “clean” or “nice.” We have such a sanitized view of Jesus that we confuse him with a polite, clean, super-spiritual, otherworldly sort of guy. But he is much more gritty and hard to handle. He is the Lord, after all. Jesus had an in-your-face kind of holiness, and he reserves his harshest judgments not for the standard old sinners, but for the religious people of his day.
Summing Up...

We have only grazed the surface of what happens when we supplant a form of "Jeebus" for the real, gutsy, untamed, intoxicating Jesus of the Gospels. In our desperate attempts to control him, we limit him and therefore box him into our own self-serving images. We fall prone time and time again to a morality that is more about observing rules and regulations than trusting in a living relationship of holiness that thrusts us into the world, rather than separates us from it.

Recovering the centrality of Jesus in discipleship is not only essential to a resurgence of authentic Christianity and the mission of the church; it is essential to the healing of historical Christianity, period! Jesus not only shapes and defines on our idea of God, but also shows us what kind of people we ought to be in the world. We are to be, and increasingly become, like him. Recovering a love for and focus on Jesus leads to a recovery of the grand themes of the church of Jesus Christ: salvation, justice, mercy, faithfulness, redemptive holiness, righteous anger at brokenness and evil, and that marvelous central fact that God is indeed love. Whatever else we might know about God, these must never be marginalized, or else we end up with a very dangerous religion. To this we turn in the next chapter.

## Suggested Practices

- Focusing faith on, in, and through Jesus: Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6), and he is called the Mediator and High Priest (1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 4:14–16; 9:15; 12:24). This means that whatever, and whenever, we think of God, it must be somehow qualified by the person of Jesus. Any approach to God must recognize the unique role of the second person of the Trinity. Make a discipline of focusing your faith through the prism of Jesus. For instance, when you pray to the Father, focus your prayer through Jesus.

- Cycling through the Gospels: One of the most basic things that needs to be done is for Christians to commit to constantly reading, and rereading, the Gospels. The Gospel accounts of Jesus fill out our understanding of him. In the Bible, revelation is given through actual history. And so we must be committed to understanding Jesus as he was... God with skin on, a person who inhabited a time, culture, and geography. If we fail to take the historical Jesus seriously, we will tend to make him into who we want him to be.

- Relate to him through the various characters in the Gospels: This is related to the practice above. Every time you reread the Gospels, try seeing them with fresh eyes, as if you have never heard any of it before. This is especially important for people who have been Christians for a long time. By being overfamiliar with the Gospels, we think we know what they (and therefore Jesus) are about, whereas they should always surprise us. For instance, try to see Jesus through the eyes of the religious people of his day—the Pharisees.

- Practice St. Ignatius's Examen: This is a very old and useful way of including Jesus into your everyday world.17 Essentially, it involves keeping a journal where you ask yourself several questions every day (or every week). They include such questions as (1) where did I work with Jesus today, and (2) where did I resist Jesus today? Be specific and prayerful about the conclusions.

- Desanitize Jesus: Churches tend to want to domesticate and sanitize Jesus. In part, sanitizing Jesus will mean humanizing him. But also it means debunking the overly "churchy" images of "Sunday school Jesus" and putting him back in the context of real life. Allow him to offend you again!

## Discussion Starters

1. Discuss the concept that it is not so much that Jesus is like God, but that God is like Jesus.

2. To what degree have you (and your community) domesticated Jesus by re creating him in your own (or collective) image? How is Jesus unlike you and your community?

3. What would happen if the radical Jesus turned up at your church?

4. What would happen to your faith and life if Jesus and his influence were entirely removed?

5. If you were around in Jesus's day, how would you personally have reacted to him? What aspects of Jesus's life and teachings and type of holiness offend your sensibilities?

6. Research and try practicing creative problem-solving
