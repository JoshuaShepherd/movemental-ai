Spontaneity, total commitment, and primal responses that arise from the depths—these are the raw materials out of which a missionary church is made.

Attention then turned to the other obvious sinner in the room: Al, who immediately had to suppress a very strong urge to run out of the house screaming. However, he managed to politely sit down and grit his teeth while they all converged to lay their hot, trembling hands on him. Their prayers were a weird mixture of cursing the devil and calling down the fire of the Spirit. All in all, pretty daunting! Then, against all expectation, it happened: God entered into Alan’s life in such a powerful way that he still (twenty-nine years later) gets goose bumps thinking about it.

Whatever transpired there in that rather odd and incongruous setting in fact became the defining moment of his life. While still unable to fully explain what happened that night, what he does know is that he somehow encountered the Eternal One, the Creator of all things, whose nature he experienced as pure redemptive love; as a result, his life was never the same again.

The Trinitarian Framework of Discipleship We open with this story, not because we think every Christian should have the same experience or that we should derive some definitive doctrine of the Spirit from it, but because it demonstrates some things we wish to highlight in a chapter the untamed god on the Holy Spirit and being an untamed disciple—that there is a wildness, a radical immediacy, an uncontrolled element of surprise when dealing with God the Holy Spirit.

Discipleship (from spiritual awakening, to conversion, to maturity) is birthed in the Spirit, but it is also very much maintained in the Spirit. While there are other forms of learning, discipleship involves growth into the “deep things of God” (1 Cor. 2:10), and this simply cannot be achieved without the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. As such, we partake of the divine dance that is intrinsic to the life of God, and we share in the divine life through the Spirit. In other words, Christian life must be lived for the glory of God, under the saving lordship of Jesus, and in the power of the Spirit. B

In fact, without the Spirit there can be no Christianity in the Scriptural sense of the term, because there will be no real knowledge of God at all: Many people have come to Christ as one of the foundational works of a result of my participation in prethe Spirit is to usher us into the senting the gospel to them. It’s all true knowledge and experience the work of the Holy Spirit. of God. Said differently: if there —Billy Graham was no Holy Spirit, there would be no possibility of encounter with God, because it is the Spirit who mediates the knowledge of God and thereby leads us into truth and righteousness (John 16:5–11). And because the Spirit brings us into deeper awareness of, and conformity to, the one true God, he keeps us from becoming toxic. T

## The Tale of Two Churches

By now you will have realized that our lives were not quite “normal.” Well, the same was true for our church life. In our early Christian experience, before we started our “official” ministry at South, we hung out in both a Pentecostal megachurch and a cessationist-fundamentalist church, which meant we got to experience life with feet on both accelerator and brake at the same time.

We would attend the more conservative, fundamentalist church on Sunday mornings, where we would sing the old hymns, hear the Word preached, and take the Lord’s supper all in a very orderly, controlled fashion. Then we would tromp off to the Pentecostal church in the evening and partake of the Pentecostal shuffle—a bouncy kind of dance known only to true devotees. These two churches were poles apart in the way they expressed their faith, but we loved it because we learned things we never would have if we limited ourselves to the one church. We came to see that the same God existed in both, and in fact we loved the diversity.

The genuine spiritual vitality of the Pentecostals kept us passionate and zealous for God, and the deep love of the Bible and earnestness of the conservatives kept us grounded and deepened our understanding of our newfound faith. We used to say that Sunday mornings kept our minds engaged and Sunday evenings kept our spirits alive. We learned about the gifts of the Spirit from the Pentecostals and the fruits of the Spirit from the conservatives. (Of course it was not that clearly divided, but you get the point.) Without doubt, this dual experience provided a solid foundation for us as young believers. H

The cramped solemnity of fundamentalism could at times really quench the work of the Holy Spirit. And some of the extreme excesses of Pentecostalism made one wonder at times whether it was really the Holy Spirit at work.

It is important to look briefly at some of the more obvious weaknesses in both expressions of evangelical Christianity.

Either of them, without being informed by the other, fails to fully represent the Holy Spirit and his work in our personal and corporate lives. And embracing only one expression, the untamed god without the counterbalance of the other, can cause us to have a less-than-adequate understanding and experience of God’s Spirit. Again, we say this as people who have a deep love for the things of God and know that our own experiences have caused us to look afresh at how the Spirit seeks to work in our lives. We ourselves are guilty of quenching the Holy Spirit because of our own reactions against the imbalances in either expression of God’s church.

## Power and control

One of the things we observed at times in our Pentecostal experience was a disconcerting kind of spiritual “engineering.” Behind some of the apparent spontaneity and spiritual dynamism was a thoroughly mechanical, cut-and-dried set of techniques that (we believe unwittingly) hurt and damaged the spiritual fabric of Jesus’s people. After being there for a while, we realized that it was the exact same “liturgy” every Sunday: rocking music to dance to (and we did), then D-minor chords to cry to (and we did), then singing in the Spirit, gifts of the Spirit (but not too much), a thirty-minute offering talk, forty minutes of preaching, ten minutes of communion, fifteen minutes of altar call, ending with some more emotive music. After years of being in ministry, we and many others have come to the conclusion that with enough of the right music, preaching, emotively charged atmosphere, and clever group-socialization (crowd-control) processes, you can pretty much grow a church without God! Technique is a terrible substitute for God—an idol—and it’s too easy to revert to it to “grow the church” while the authentic experience of the Holy Spirit is being edged out the back door.

The other seriously problematic issue for charismatics and Pentecostals is an apparent preoccupation with power and secret knowledge—never a particularly good look for sinful humans. For all the fantastic aspects of the Pentecostal movement, it doesn’t take long to discern an unhealthy obsession with power and “insider” knowledge. Much (not all—hence the need for spiritual discernment) that goes by the name “word of knowledge” and “prophecy” is actually thinly veiled attempts to control people. And many of the “dog and pony shows” that go under the name of miracle meetings are manifestations of a profo

To shock us into the dangers of this, we should remember that the Nazis were also good at these things—they scoured the earth for occult objects of power and used knowledge in a profoundly occult way! The Nuremberg rallies are still object studies in mass manipulation. The search for occult knowledge and magical powers goes as far back into human experience as we can tell, and when genuine Christian empowerment and the knowledge of God are distorted, they deteriorate into a mildly Christianized obsession with magic and gnosis. And these in turn draw their energies, not from God, but from some of the darkest aspects in human nature— and beyond that, from the demonic itself.

Pentecostalism needs to be very wary of uncritical understandings of the category of power. Confusing God’s power with human attempts to control is very dangerous indeed and leads directly to toxic-city. If we both measure and define ourselves in relation to Jesus, then we must look to Jesus to understand authentic spiritual power and the right use of knowledge. When we see how Jesus operates, all normal notions of human power are actually inverted! The greatest becomes the Crowd dynamics. the untamed god least, the child, the servant—in other words, the powerless.

Jesus himself explicitly rejects offers of power (Luke 4:1–13) and instead reveals his true glory and power in and through the cross—hardly a normal place of power (1 Cor. 1:18–2:9; Phil. 2:1–11).

## Order and control

On the other hand, we have the fundamentalists—ironically named, because to us it appeared that there was not a lot of fun but a whole lot of mental. Actually fundamentalism describes the religious mood of both movements we experienced, so perhaps we can basically say that it seemed to us that our more mainline Protestant evangelical brethren simply had a semi-pathological distaste for things disorderly and out of control. They sought order and control, and they did so in the name of maintaining “objectivity.”

People really do fear the God encounter, and for good reason. “It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Heb. 10:31). The approach of the divine can present a real danger to fallen human beings. We take our own security and ways of thinking very seriously and fear the loss of control that God’s sovereignty brings with it.

Here lies the root of our rebellion and idolatry. In spite of what we say in our choruses about wanting to be touched and ravished by God, we don’t really mean it: we generally prefer to worship and know God at a safe distance. British missiologist and theologian J. V. Taylor rightly says of our encounter with God,

To encounter the Holy Spirit will be more like suddenly catching sight of the volcanic inferno beneath our earth’s familiar crust. The Holy Spirit is totally primordial. His is the elemental force beyond all other forces, and to call it, correctly, the force of love is not to temper its intensity but to increase fearfully our estimate of love’s fervor.

Another problem for the more conservative mainline churches is doctrine worship. Doctrine is good, but only as a guide to the right experience of God. And make no mistake, doctrines of God can intrude into the actual God relationship.

In fact, this is what we think has happened to a large portion of Christianity today. It certainly was the problem of the Pharisees: when their doctrine became too hard set, it preset their understanding of God. That meant they were unable to comprehend God as he appeared in Jesus; Jesus simply did not fit their theological categories. However, they refused to change their categories to suit the revelation of God, and so they ended up rejecting the Messiah they longed for. Much of the Gospel of John explores this tragic misapprehension, and it is called the power of darkness.

God takes a break.

We must learn from this: we must not use the Word of God as a shield against the actual presence of God. Lesslie Newbigin rightly warns, “Aproper confidence in the ancient promises of God must not become an improper and eventually fatal barrier against recognizing and rejoicing in the action of God now.”2 As important as theology is in guiding our understanding of God, it must never be allowed to substitute for our relationship to God himself. God cannot be limited to ideology or theological assertions about him.

This is another, very subtle form of idolatry. Truth must guide the relationship, but it is an easy slip from there into worshiping the idea of God rather than God himself. It was the untamed god the early church father Gregory of Nyssa who, knowing the propensities of the Hellenistic mind, warned that “every concept which comes from some comprehensible image by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the divine nature constitutes an idol of God and does not proclaim God.”3 That this form of idolatry is prevalent in the church is beyond question. The theological rationalism of the Western church is actually another form of Gnosticism that has plagued us from the time Christianity moved into the Gentile world. This time Gnostic impulses are manifested not so much through spooky prophetic “words of knowledge” (as in charismatic circles), but by managing God and people through controlling the ideas that shape them.
The danger is that if such people desire control through objective truth, then, like all forms of deception and idolatry, their wish is simply granted (see chapter 2 on self-deception).

That is exactly what they get: a whole lot of theology, but a fading experience of the God theology should point to. Author James Jones sums this up nicely: “The Bible is of little value without the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit. The Bible has no significance when ripped from the context of the experience of the Spirit. Refusing to subsume the Spirit under the Word frees the Spirit to do more than confirm the text and shut up.”4 Shutting the Spirit up, as Jones says, is a serious hindrance to untamed discipleship and should be recognized as one of the obstacles many readers need to overcome. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to usher us into a direct love and knowledge of God. D

The Shema calls us into a life of active love of and service to God and others. Love is the actual means of knowing God.

## Heat and light company

Perhaps you, like us, have experienced some of these same excesses first hand. For us it meant becoming increasingly disillusioned and cynical about the negative aspects of both ends of the spectrum, and as a result we became a less Spiritdirected than we were at first. As church leaders, we now know all too well that this is the tragic story of so many new churches and moves of the Spirit, as religion and technique creep in and subvert the primal forces and more chaotic freedoms associated with the Spirit, or the “Beyond-in-OurMidst,” as J. V. Taylor calls him.

Truly we need both light and power, and thankfully the Holy Spirit provides both. In the Spirit, one need not be gained at the expense of the other—we are guided into a direct encounter with truth, but we are also baptized in a holy fire.

Akind of holy burning should describe aspects of our life from The Holy Spirit Is Busy that point on (John 14:16; Acts There was a boy riding on his bike 2). The conservative evangelicals outside a church. The priest saw need to be willing to fly closer him and told him to come into the to the flame and cope with holy church, and the boy said, “But they’ll chaos in their lives and churches, steal my bike.” The priest explained how the while the more charismatically Holy Spirit would take care of it, so inclined need to learn the value they went inside. of objective truth and communal The priest showed the boy how accountability.

Untamed disciples must allow themselves to be drawn into the numinous and somewhat dangerous orbit of the divine if they are going to be genuine lovers of God. As the moth is drawn the untamed god to the flame, believers who have made God into a system of ideas need to risk being overwhelmed by God again if they wish to be authentic disciples. B

## Whole Holiness

Before we move on to some of the many wonderful expressions of the Holy Spirit, we thought it important to address some of our misunderstandings around the issue of holiness. As mentioned in chapter 1, often our understanding of biblical holiness is one that leads us to see holiness from a negative perspective or as a list of “don’ts” and prohibitions. One of the key roles of the Holy Spirit is to oversee the change process by which we become holy, and when holiness is properly understood, it is actually an incredibly redemptive, highly missional concept.

Part of the problem with our understanding of holiness relates to the fact that we understand the word “holy” as a passive adjective when we refer to the “Holy” Spirit. But there is another, more distinctly Hebraic way of translating the original language that emphasizes other dimensions of the work of the Spirit in our lives. Rather than translating hagia as a passive adjective (“the Spirit who is holy”) we can legitimately translate it far more dynamically as “the Sanctifying Spirit”—that is, it is the Spirit who is actively engaged in making the world a more holy place. Isn’t this who God is, and doesn’t it far better describe what he is doing all the time?

When we talk of God as being holy, or of Jesus as holy, or of the Holy Spirit, we must resist the temptation to see holiness in moralistic terms, or else we do violence to the idea of the redeeming God and end up seeing God as the ultimate moralist! That is simply bad theology. God is the model of holiness and we must become like the One we love. “As obedient children, let yourselves be pulled into a way of life shaped by God’s life, a life energetic and blazing with holiness” (1 Peter 1:15 Message).

A Hebraic understanding of holiness suggests that all of life is actually in the process of being redeemed and brought into the sphere of the sacred: Holiness begins with God, flows into our own hearts and our lives, moves from there into the community, and eventually reaches every aspect of life in the world. God is extending his sanctity over ever-increasing portions of life until all is made holy. God is never a detached observer, but is deeply involved in the sanctification of the world. In fact he leads the charge!

This way of understanding holiness is far more worldengaging, and is best exemplified in the life, teachings, and ministry of Jesus. As we have seen, the biblical concept of holiness provides us with a much more active, and therefore missional, understanding of holiness than we are used to in the Western tradition. Holiness is not gained by withdrawal from the world, but by active, redemptive, engagement in the world.

Instead of looking at holiness as a list of “don’ts,” see it as a list of “do’s”; for every prohibition in Scripture actually implies its positive. In fact, positive virtue generates the prohibition. For instance, in the Ten Commandments, “do not kill” actually teaches that we should value and preserve life. “Do not commit adultery” implies we should actively pursue holiness in relationships, and so on.

Another dimension of biblical holiness is the idea of consecration: of being set aside to do a distinct task. True holiness involves clearing the desk, setting selfish agendas aside, and being willing to partner with God in the redemptionsanctification of the world by doing all things—the everyday things—in his name and for his glory. God is holy, therefore we consecrate ourselves to the task of being holy as he is holy (Lev. 11:44; 19:2). His holiness is redemptive. Holiness is dynamically missional, very engaged... profoundly unthe untamed god tame! Being holy, therefore, is not about being a detached, judgmental, culturally colorless person; it means being like God, who is far from all these things! How we are holy either misrepresents or rightly represents who God is. When we are more like Jesus, we will be holy as God intended it.
Let There Be...

So much for obstacles that need to be identified and overcome in our relationship to God. Now it’s time to take a good look at some things (there will naturally be more than we can list in one chapter) that should result from a truly vital experience of the Holy Spirit. Guided by the understanding that we discern the work of the Spirit by recognizing his attributes, we can say that the presence of the Spirit in our lives and in the community should be evidenced by the following characteristics.

> Let there be some serious creativity

The Spirit is the agent of creation. I nconceivable power and creativity reside in him. Look at the sheer genius evident in the design of the universe, the brilliant simplicity of the subatomic world, or the intricacies of human nature: all are created by the Spirit of God. It is not too much to expect that where he is present, there will be an uprush of serious creativity. In fact, we should really question the Spirit’s manifest presence in the church if there is no creativity, but simply religious ritual and rut-like habit.

The disciple’s connection to the Spirit should set him or her a’dreamin’. We shouldn’t be surprised that people in touch with the Holy Spirit get creative, artistic, and entrepreneurial.

This is something we should expect and celebrate. It’s not coincidental that the prophecy of Joel (fulfilled at Pentecost) says that the oldies are going to dream dreams again and the young people will get visions. In fact, creativity forms a major part of our mission in the world. Not only does it diminish suffering and beautify our world, but it plays a role in the invention of a better world to live in. Asanctified imagination is a powerful tool because the fundamental job of the imagination in life is to produce, out of the society we have to live in, a vision of the society we want to live in. This is the human expression of God’s dream for the world that is normally called the kingdom of God. B

## Let there be risky mission

Missio Dei is a term used to describe the mission of God.

This sentness (missio) describes the nature of the triune God himself. God sends his Son into the world. The Father is a sending God, and the Son is a sent one. And the Father and the Son send the Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26). The Spirit is a missionary—so much so that when reading Acts, it’s hard to tell whether thebook should be titled the Acts of the Spirit or the Acts of the Apostles. Mission is ascribed to both, and both play an essential part. B

We follow the Spirit in mission. Mission is a spiritual quest and is very close to the heart of God. To do it well, we must be willing to deal with the Spirit, discern his ways, and align ourselves with his purposes.

## Let there be communitas

Communitas is a concept Alan explores in depth in The Forgotten Ways.6 It basically describes the kind of community that forms in the context of a dangerous ordeal, a demanding task, or another form of challenge that requires the members of the group to “find” each other in a new and dynamic way. It happens when people move from being friends or associates to being comrades. It describes the discipleship of the New Testament as well as movements that achieve significant impact on their surroundings. Communities of the Spirit are frontiers of the kingdom, and this means that there will always be an element of adventure inherent in them.

Discipleship clearly demands that we integrate an element of constant change and a substantial amount of risk into our lives. Following Jesus is never safe when it comes to our tamed, middle-class sensibilities. Simply encountering together the numinous Holy Spirit of God should be enough to create communitas; when we add the missional church dynamics described in the section above, we should expect this form of camaraderie-fellowship to characterize our churches. Where the Spirit is, there will be wild community adventures.

> Let there be lots of little Jesuses
> One of the works of the Spirit is to make us more like Jesus.

Second Corinthians 3 is a passage dedicated to this concept.

Paul ends with an insightful and profound reflection on the inner spirituality of discipleship when he says, “And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his [Jesus’s] likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit” (v. 18). When we grasp passages like this together with those that talk about the Spirit of Christ within us (for example, Romans 8), we can say that if we are not heading toward authentic Christlikeness, and therefore engaged in discipleship, then there is something deeply wrong with our spirituality. This is why Lyons and Kinnaman’s research in un Christian (mentioned in an earlier chapter) is so unnerving.

If the Holy Spirit is manifestly at work, there will be a whole lot of little Jesuses hanging around. We should expect this, and when it is missing, we should be very concerned indeed. Where the Spirit is, there will be untamed, Jesus-like disciples.

## Let there be love

Paul says, “God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us” (Rom. 5:5). The giving of the Spirit is not only an act of unprecedented love, but it should also inspire love in us, because God is love. In the end, Christian discipleship and mission should be an everdeepening exploration of the redemptive power of love.

J. V. Taylor explores this aspect of human and divine interconnectivity in his book on the Holy Spirit called The GoBetween God. He sees the central work of the Spirit as the “go-between”—between God and humanity, between people, and between humans and their world. In other words, he is our context, or as Taylor says, our “milieu.” The Spirit is the one that brings all things together in righteousness. Where we see love, justice, mercy, and faithfulness being expressed in human affairs, in or out of the church, Taylor says we see something of the Spirit’s handiwork. R

However we might conceptualize the presence of love, goodness, and grace in the world, it is the work of the Spirit of God in the world.

The work of the Spirit will call us to love and trust God’s way of doing things and not to rely on any form of coercion or technique. Love is its own power. Where the Spirit is, there will be untamed, messianic love.

> Let there be learning community

When Alan had his encounter with the Holy Spirit, he remembers distinctly feeling that his mind had just caught fire. It almost felt like he had never thought real thoughts before that time. That experience was accompanied by an unquenchable curiosity that exists undiminished to this day.

Of course this should not be surprising when we recognize that God designed the vast intricacies of the mind in the first place. The life the Spirit brings includes a passionate drive for understanding God’s magnificent creation and for ultimately exploring the mind of God himself. All who think (and teach) that we check our minds at the door when we become Christians—those who diminish the need for deep intellectual engagement—insult the Creator’s purposes in designing the human mind in the first place.

Agreat example of passion for life, commitment to radical discipleship and risky mission, as well as a deep love of learning can be found in the Celtic movement, which played such a key role in evangelizing Europe in the dark ages. In a marvelous book, Thomas Cahill describes how the Irish monastic movement helped save civilization through their love of learning, commitment to study, and writing and storing texts for others to read.7 If ever there was an integrated missional church empowered by the Holy Spirit, it was the Irish movement founded by Patrick and developed by Columba, Aidan, and others. Where the Spirit is, there will be an untamed and constantly adaptive learning community.

## Let there be some miracles

Humbug to all the liberal theologies that disregard the clearly supernatural aspects of life in God! It is just another rationalist ploy to control God and people through ideas.

There is no way we can comprehend the ministry of Jesus, experience the power of the resurrection, or even understand the dynamics of the early church unless we give significant space to the idea that God can, and does, intervene in history.

Disciples of the untamed and untamable Jesus will be open to the leading, empowering, liberating work of the Spirit. And they will surely hope for a whole lot more of those gracious interventions we call miracles. Where the Spirit is, there will be the in-breaking of God through miracles.

> Let there be spiritual maturity

This might seem obvious given that holiness and spiritual maturity seem to be inextricably linked, but in a world that barely understands the meaning of holiness, it is necessary to reiterate. The Spirit nurtures us toward human wholeness by bringing us closer to the reality of holiness. In 1 Corinthians 2:10–16, Paul makes connections between the Spirit and healthy human spirituality, and the absence of the Spirit and what he calls “soulishness.” The reality is that we cannot mature if we do not open our hearts to the work of the Spirit. Only the Sanctifying Spirit can usher in a true Christian spirituality.
Let there be a lot more discernment This book has to do with overcoming obstacles inherent in our thinking about God, present in our culture, and programmed into our psyches. It is a book about idolatry, false worship, deception, and the lies we tell ourselves to get off the hook. It takes a serious keenness of spirit (and purity of heart) to be able to discern these errors and problems the untamed god in faith—in other words, it requires spiritual discernment (Heb. 5:14; 1 Cor. 2:14–15). In fact, it is one of the gifts of the Spirit given to the church so that we might be able to faithfully negotiate our world (1 Cor. 12:10).
> Let there be unity around Jesus

One of the best vision statements we have ever seen for a community of believers was simply “to live under the Lordship of Jesus in the power of the Spirit.” It rightly locates the center of the faith around Jesus and his lordship, but it recognizes that to do this we need the power and guidance of the Spirit. In fact, this is one of the functions of the Spirit in the church—to keep us on track and to maintain unity around our Lord. In Ephesians, we are called to “make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called—one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all” (4:3–6). It is a wonderful restatement of Shema spirituality, but it is interesting to note that faith is maintained by keeping the unity already given to the church by the Spirit. Where the Spirit of Christ is, there will be a deep and abiding oneness in Jesus.

> Let there be ecstasy and intimacy

Part of the work of the Spirit is to bring the joy of God into real life. The coming of the Holy Spirit upon people in the New Testament is usually experienced as an ecstatic encounter with God (see, for example, Acts 2, 10, 19). To be enthused (literally, en-theos, in-dwelt by God) is part of the wonderful works of the Spirit of God. Ecstasy, literally a “going out” of oneself, is usually also accompanied by intimacy (a profound closeness) with God and also with other disciples. S

When referring to knowing God, the OT often uses the word yada. This word derives from the idea of personal intimacy between people and, as we said before, can be used to describe sexual intercourse. It refers to a deeply subjective form of knowledge where intellectual barriers are overcome and the immeasurable distance between knower and known is finally bridged: it approximates what the later mystics would call “union with God.” Mere objective knowledge leaves the knower uncommitted, but truly knowing God, in the deepest biblical sense, can only be gained by a thoroughly personal, existential involvement and through a self-giving rooted in total self-giving, which is the very life of God. Where the Spirit is, there will be a loving abandonment to God as well as righteous intimacy with others.

> Let there be liberation and transformation

We both love the New Testament translation called “The Voice.” One of the reasons is that it refers to Jesus as the Liberator. Luke 4 demonstrates that when the Holy Spirit is at work, there will be deep and profound liberation. The Spirit of the Lord anoints Jesus and the result is liberation of people from all kinds of oppression. Putting aside the unique aspects of Jesus’s messianic ministry, we should still expect no less in our experience of the Spirit. Paul is right in saying, “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor. 3:17). The presence of the Spirit frees people from all sorts of bondage: political, cultural, religious, ideological, psychological, demonic... whatever. The Spirit brings freedom: he is the presence of the sovereign rule of God, a lordship that displaces all that cramps the human spirit as God intended it to be. the untamed god In concluding this chapter, we want to say first that the above list is by no means exhaustive. B

Untamed discipleship is Spirit-filled discipleship.

Second, it is tempting to compartmentalize teaching on the Holy Spirit as part of theology and doctrine, detached from real life—which is about practical issues. Theology, properly understood, is never to be separated from life, but rather should act as a guide to life. When we compartmentalize into the false categories of “doctrine” and “life,” we inevitably end up with either a tame Christianity or the toxic religion we have been describing so far in this book. This is particularly true in our understanding of God the Holy Spirit. He is the “Beyond-in-Our-Midst,” and we are privileged to be bearers and recipients of his presence. Being a living temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19) is not a religious thing that happens in church; rather, it takes place in every context of life. T

In our perspective and experience, the missional church movement in the West needs to seriously re-embrace the role of the Holy Spirit as part of the Christian experience. And if we really want to recover the lost ethos of authentic missional Christianity, we are going to have to take the risk of encountering the divine and personally experiencing God in wild and wonderful ways in order to bring the kingdom into this time and place. It’s going to take untamed disciples who, as lovers and pursuers of God, have no defenses and are willing to lay bare their hearts before him to make this happen. Amen, come Holy Spirit.

The initial chapters of this book are more theological because it is vital for disciples to get a handle on the God we love and follow. As we have seen, we know God supremely in and through Jesus, but even the incarnation of the Word does not limit the greatness of God. And although we can never hope to fully comprehend God, for he is infinite and all-powerful, it is incumbent on us at least to trace the contours of the God we encounter in the Bible. We need to get the essentials right. Aliving and direct experience of his love, mercy, holiness, and redeeming nature are prerequisites for a healthy expression of faith.

But all this comes at a cost. It demands something from us. Adisciple will need to recognize up front that God loves us way too much to leave us as we are. Knowing God and following his Son in the power of the Spirit will require that we allow ourselves to be stripped of a rebellious religion that prevents a true experience of God and restricts our capacity to truly love him. God’s love is all-embracing and requires an allexclusive relationship—he simply will not share us with other gods. Idolatry must go. So too must the lies we tell ourselves to moderate the demanding nature of the relationship. T

## Suggested Practices

- Because the work of the Spirit is not always spectacular, we have to learn to “see” the work of the Spirit in everyday life. Again, we believe the questions of the Examen are helpful in this regard: “Where in this last week have I worked with the Spirit, and where have I resisted the Spirit in my life?” Decide to regularly journal the responses.

- Like us, we suggest you take an inventory of your life

in the Spirit. Using the list contained in the “let there be” section above, take stock of (1) your own life, and (2) your community. Where are you weak and where are you strong?

- Thebook of Acts has rightly been called The Acts of the

Holy Spirit: reread theBook of Acts and try to discern the untamed god how the Holy Spirit is involved in the life of the early church. Develop your own understanding of the Holy Spirit in the church.

## Discussion Starters

1. Read the Ananias and Sapphira passage (Acts 5:1–5).

Discuss among yourselves how false motives, lack of accountability, and even lies can hide behind explicitly “spiritual” language.

2. The word for spirit (pneuma) in the original Greek

text does not distinguish what spirit is being referred first with a capital “S” (as in standard translations) and then with a lowercase “s” (which is not the standard translation). Discuss what insights come to mind.

3. Where is the Spirit to be found in middle-class life?

What would happen if the Spirit entered more deeply into your urban or suburban existence?

4. How have we, corporately and individually, quenched

the Spirit in recent times?
