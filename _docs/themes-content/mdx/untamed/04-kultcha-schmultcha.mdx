# Kultcha-Schmultcha

Human existence cannot derive its ultimate meaning from society because society itself is in need of meaning.

—Abraham Heschel Because the Light is radically different from the Darkness, the manifestation of the Light always opposes the Darkness....

This is not to say that disciples should not agree with secular voices at certain points, but is merely to warn that simply seconding the wisdom of the world is not testimony to the Word of God.

This was not an isolated incident; fights and injuries occurred elsewhere at other stores operated by Wal-Mart, America’s leading discount chain. Meanwhile, two men at a crowded Toys “R” Us store in Palm Desert, California, pulled guns and shot each other to death after the women accompanying them brawled over bargains. When interviewed after the event, Joe Priester, former president of the Society for Consumer Psychology, commented, “I think it ties into a sort of fear and panic of not having enough.”1 Something profound is being signified in these events. They are a manifestation, a parable if you will, of some of the dangerous, subterranean energies that seem to pervade our culture.

## Discipleship in Reverse

Identifying the spirits of our age while living in and—to varying degrees—being immersed in the prevailing culture is one of the trickiest things disciples have to negotiate. As missionaries following the traces of God, we must affirm that which is genuinely good and present in any and every human culture, for many aspects are indeed wholesome and true and affirmed by the gospel. But the opposite is also true.

There is a lot that is dehumanizing, degrading, and evil, and the disciple is called to somehow discern the difference between it and what is good. The problem is that unless we are very sensitive to God and can discern the sometimes-blurry kultcha-schmultcha boundaries between right and wrong, or holy and unholy, culture can have as much an effect on us as disciples as we can have on it. In our day, one is left wondering if it is us who are actually being “evangelized” by the prevailing mass culture rather than the other way around.

We do inhabit a church of what some commentators call “Christianity Lite,” and, by all accounts, it is us who have been acculturated—not the other way around. We have come to believe through hard experience and lots of reflection that the church has been deeply compromised by aspects of the prevailing culture. Christians now easily reflect the characteristics and the conditions of the wider culture. But what we have gained in relevancy we lose in witness and impact, for “though popular culture holds tremendous potential for good, unfortunately, today’s trend is towards a diversionary, mindless, celebrity-driven superficiality. Sadly this reflects our general societal condition, for popular culture can only rise to the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic heights of its average citizenry.”2 This is not good news for missional Christianity, for if Christianity just mirrors its culture, what is the point of its mission?

This is no excuse to withdraw ourselves from culture, but rather as disciples we must learn to live the tension between gospel and culture, to discern how to hold on to what is true and discard that which is evil (Rom. 12:9). And as agents (missionaries) of the wild Messiah, we also need to interpret and redeem the world/s in which we live. All this goes directly to the issue of discipleship formation and to the reality that the church has largely been unsuccessful at prioritizing disciple making as the primary mission of the church (Matt.

28:16–20). Only disciples formed in the ways of the radical missionary Jesus can make an impact on such a potent cultural system as the one we live and move in.

Willow Creek Association bravely admitted as much in its publication Reveal. The report acknowledges that what they’ve been doing for these many years and what they’ve the untamed culture taught millions of others to do is not producing solid disciples of Jesus Christ—numbers, yes, but disciples, no. Bill Hybels admits that “if you simply want a crowd, the ‘seeker sensitive’ model produces results. If you want solid, sincere, mature followers of Christ, it’s a bust.”3 This should actually be of no surprise to us, as Jesus clearly lays out the conditions for following him—he calls for nothing less than death to self.

This means that all personal and cultural agendas must be laid down at the foot of Jesus as a precondition to following him.

If we, in a sincere attempt to reach contemporary audiences, reconfigure the processes of Christian formation, putting the challenge of discipleship off to the end, then, in our opinion, we are opening the floodgates to being “evangelized” by the culture. When we remove Jesus’s preconditions to following him and use professional mass entertainment (no matter how sincere) to draw people to Christ, we should not be surprised at the results—we simply can’t entertain consumers into becoming disciples, and nor can people consume their way into following Jesus.

But the problem has even deeper roots than a consumerist church. It stems from the fact that even before we come to Christ, we have already been powerfully discipled by pop culture. We come to Jesus as inveterate consumers holding values that often run completely contrary to the ways of the gospel. High capitalism, the market, postmodern superficiality, and the sheer power of the mass media all conspire to ensure that we are already ardent disciples of the gods of the age. It is unlikely that there has ever been a time when the population has been so thoroughly programmed and brainwashed without even knowing it.

Dick Staub warns us of this frightening reality: The largest companies in the world are spending billions of dollars to drive a diversionary, mindless, celebrity-fuelled popular culture down the highway of new technologies and into our lives in order to sell us stuff we don’t want or need. They kultcha-schmultcha don’t care about us, what we believe or how we want to live.

The ads and products regularly reduce women to sex objects and men to voyeurs and predators. They are unconcerned with what is in our best interests spiritually or intellectually, and in fact, it is in their best interest to keep us spiritually desensitized and dumb. They play to our unhappiness, magnifying the feeling that we are missing something essential and that if we had this something they offer, we would be fulfilled. They then encourage us to shop, convincing us that shopping will do today what it failed to do yesterday—fill what French religious philosopher Pascal calls the God-shaped vacuum.4 This is what we are dealing with, and there is no doubt that it has deeply and indelibly shaped each and every one of us. Being conscious of this fact doesn’t necessarily mean we are free from its pull. For example, when taking a break from writing this book, we found ourselves wandering around the local mall. After about twenty minutes of browsing, we looked at each other and the question occurred to us: what were we doing there?
To refer to a remarkable movie that explored the totality of the system we are born into, we are born, live, and have our being in “the matrix.” The matrix’s appeal goes deep and reaches into our secret insecurities, our penchant for greed, the untamed culture our desire for status, and our need for love and freedom. If we are going to be untamed followers of the wild Lord of our lives, then we are going to have to deal with these dynamics in our culture. We have to escape from Babylon and return to Zion in order to liberate Babylon. To some of these dynamics we now turn.

## The Green God

Martin Luther said three conversions are necessary when a person decides to follow Christ: the conversion of the heart, the conversion of the mind, and the conversion of the purse.

And John Wesley wryly remarked that the last thing to convert was a person’s wallet.

Money plays an overpowering, all-encompassing role in history and in our lives. Let’s face it: the love of it, and all it represents, reaches into each and every heart. Who can honestly claim to be utterly free from its almost magical appeal?

Money is big, powerful, alluring, and very demanding. So we should not be surprised that Jesus would have something to say about it.

And he does. Richard Foster notes that Jesus actually speaks more about money and wealth than any other topic except the kingdom of God! And he goes on to document the evidence.6 Jesus devoted time and energy to the issue because he knew the power it wields over our imaginations and lives. In fact, there is no other single thing he describes as being in such direct competition to God as money. Jesus clearly states, “No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. Y

There is no prevarication here, no ambiguity, no getting around it. According to our Master, money exists in opposition to the claims God makes over our lives. And if we are kultcha-schmultcha not careful, mammon and materialism can hinder the work of mission and limit spiritual effectiveness.

Susan Hope, a British missiologist, raises a good question: Is it just co-incidence that sees lightheartedness about ownership of goods as a context for healing and effective evangelism in the stories of the Early Church? “No good asking me for silver and gold—haven’t got any. But I will give you what I have—in the name of Jesus of Nazareth—walk!” (Acts 3:6).

“No one claimed any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord” (Acts 4:32–33).7

Paul also has the same attitude toward wealth: among other things, he says that the “love” of money is the root of all (or every) kind of evil (1 Tim. 6:10). James the brother of Jesus does not mince words either (James 5:1–5). If we read Jesus and New Testament teaching correctly, we can only understand money if we interpret it in light of the teachings of the principalities and powers against which we must do battle. Money is not a neutral force, but is animated and energized by powers. T

The rejection of the god of mammon is a necessary precondition to becoming a disciple of Jesus. And, in point of fact, money has many of the characteristics of deity. It gives us security, can induce guilt, gives us freedom, gives us power and seems to be omnipresent. Most sinister of all, however, is its bid for omnipotence.... It seems that money is not willing to rest content in its proper place alongside other things we value. No, it must have supremacy. It must crowd out all else. We attach importance to it far beyond its worth. In fact we attach ultimate importance to it. It is tremendously instructive to stand back and observe the the untamed culture frantic scramble of people for money or things related to money [what it can buy and what it can give us]. And this does not occur just among the poor and starving. Quite to the contrary—the super wealthy, who really have nothing to gain by more money, still seek it furiously. The middle class, who are really quite adequately cared for (and who are from a global perspective the wealthy), continue to buy more houses than they need, to acquire more cars than they need, to have more clothes than they need. Many of us could live on half of what we now receive without much serious sacrifice, yet we feel that we are just barely making ends meet [because the world, the media, and the devil are telling us that this is so].9 Foster goes on to say that money is one of the principalities and powers that must be conquered and redeemed through the blood of Jesus Christ before it can be usable for the greater good of the kingdom of God. To truly walk in the way of Jesus, one must be free of the love of money and the pride that often goes along with it. In the words of our friend and colleague Wes White, “[The wealthy Christians]... have to be rescued... from the hubris that is usually [associated] with mammon and [which] invariably precludes the presence and power of God.”10 Once we are rescued, we can be free to be generous, and when we are generous, we are agents of Jesus’s remarkable grace. We cannot overestimate the power of generosity in human relations. Not only does it destroy the power of money, but it introduces the one who receives the gift (as well as the one who gives the gift) into the world of grace.11 Seen this way, giving is actually a sacrament because, as theologian Miroslav Volf says, “every gift breaks the barrier between the sacred and the mundane and floods the mundane with the sacred.”12 Volf also suggests, “We’re set up to buy and sell, not to give and receive.”13 This means we are trained from a young age to calculate before giving money away rather than to be truly generous. F

Being calculatingly generous is not the same as being radically generous. If we are going to engender an ethos of untamed generosity, we will need much healthier images of God than the two commonly held false stereotypes of God as giver, namely, the Wheeler-Dealer god and the Santa Claus god. Unlike the Wheeler-Dealer God, God generously gives without any semblance of negotiation, because he needs nothing that we have and asks more than we could ever give. God gives simply because he is gracious. On the other hand, the Santa Claus god demands nothing of us. But is it true that God demands nothing of us? No, God gives so that we can become joyful givers ourselves rather than self-absorbed receivers or consumers.

## Play with Maar’kit

Have you ever noticed that financial commentators tend to personify the term “market” with reverence when they use it?

Statements such as “The market punished the low profit yields of Xcompany today,” or “The market did this or that” furnish us with the distinct sense that the word is meant to be used with a capital “M” and spoken of with spiritual veneration— more like “Maar’kit.” This is a dead giveaway for the religious awe with which many regard its power. What?! Like the market has a personality? It can make choices, determine the outcome of history, provide meaning, and even make judgments over what constitutes good or bad decisions?! In other words, it sounds awfully like Maar’kit has actually developed an imposing persona—we are back to that darn idolatry again! And a moody and capricious god it proves to be. Beware, those who submit to it, because Maar’kit has a really bad temper—he (or she) gives and takes away, at will. the untamed culture

Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption.... We need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever accelerating rate.15 Andy Warhol famously quipped that buying is much more American than thinking! Apparently Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman thinks it is in the economy’s best interest to keep it that way: “Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundations of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible. T

We moved to California and began our research for this book at a very historic time—the 2008 election. One of the things in the lead-up to the election was of course the systemic stock market crash. People were frantic, clutching for their kultcha-schmultcha dollars before they disappeared. At the height of the panic, it was interesting to note that as debates about what to do about the crisis were underway, massive bailouts and all, no one mentioned even the possibility of actually closing down the stock markets so that market raiders wouldn’t exploit the situation or shareholders couldn’t sell in a panicky way. And yet that would have resolved the immediate issues involved in the crisis—panic selling resulting in a market crash. No, it seems that Maar’kit and his devotees would not put up with that. It just goes to show that the market plays way too important of a role in our lives. S

Directly related to the role of money and wealth in society is the increasingly powerful religion of consumerism.

Oh Lord, Won’t You Buy Me a Mercedes-Benz...

Alan was initially trained in marketing and advertising before becoming a follower of Jesus, and both he and I (Deb) are at Using Truth for Dollars least “working” theologians. Contemporary practices in adverWhen we look at the power of tising and marketing are explicitly consumerism and the market exploiting religious motivations in in our lives, we are thoroughly people! Alan recently had a chilling convinced that we are dealing conversation with an advertising with a very significantly religious guru who stated that “best practice phenomenon: if the role of rein marketing is taking on where the church has left off. As Chrisligion is to mediate a sense of tianity vacates Western society, identity, purpose, meaning, and we are stepping right in to fill the community, it can be said that gap.” In fact, this is precisely the consumerism fulfills all these sin of Satan—to use truth for ends criteria.17 other than those for which it was For instance, some now use intended. the term “expressive capital” to the untamed culture brand and sell products. This is the current ideology behind marketing, and it teaches that “at the center of every human soul is the intense longing to be closer to God.” Abrand that can empathize with that is “powerful,” and “the market for something to believe in is infinite.”18 This thinking gets close to being demonic, because it exploits people at the deepest possible level: the level of meaning and existence.
Appeal to basic needs will not do in our culture. Marketing strategy now explicitly exploits the vacuum of spirituality left by the vacating of Christianity from the public imagination. Marketing has stepped in where the church has stepped out.

## The new “golden calf.”

Consumerism now provides a direct link between personal happiness and the purchase and consumption of material possessions. It involves basing one’s identity, including one’s sense of “community,” in a brand, and making choices in an attempt to find meaning in shopping and consuming.

For most people in Western contexts, shopping is spirituality. It is an attempt to find meaning and happiness in the product. And we all do it! Lets face it: for most of us, when we go to the mall, we are not simply doing it to fulfill basic survival needs. We are seeking something else! When kultcha-schmultcha we buy a house, a car (or a second car, for that matter), fashion items, or electronics, far more than “basic” needs are being indulged in. Seeking status, identity, fulfillment, and happiness is often our ulterior motivation, rather than meeting basic needs.

Once again we are back to idolatry: the attempt to establish meaning and purpose on our own terms outside of a relationship with God—or as theologian Paul Tillich defined it, giving ultimate value to that which is not ultimate. Because of the total pervasiveness of consumerism and the dominance of the market, this presents a far more insidious challenge to the claims of Jesus over our lives because, in so many ways, it infects each and every one of us.

As Helen Trinca and Catherine Fox note,

> For many of us, buying the goods and services we want does

We may have felt happy when we were doing our duty to God or to a community, or enjoyed the feeling that work was itself a virtuous activity, a good thing to do. Our reward for work was financial but also spiritual or religious. Materialism, hedonism, the linking of happiness with consumption were all regarded as dubious pursuits in a religious age....

Consumption has filled the vacuum of meaning in the 21st century and plays a powerful role in ambitions. You may not get an interesting job—after all, not everyone can—but you can moderate the anger and sadness at missing out by buying hard, by acquiring goods that describe you and how you live your life.19

Consumerism as a religious phenomenon is as thoroughly pagan as worshiping Baal. Seen in this light, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Extreme Makeover, Big Brother, and other lifestyle shows are some of the most pagan, and paganizing, shows on TV. Even the perennial favorites about renovating the house paganize us because they focus us on that which so easily enslaves us. In these, the banality of consumerism reaches a climax as we are sold the lie that the thing that will complete us is a new kitchen or a house extension. In fact, these only add more stress to our mortgages and our families.21 These shows are far more successful promoters of unbelief than even outright intellectual atheism because they hit us at that place where we must render our trust and loyalty. And most people are profoundly susceptible to the idolatrous allure of money and things.
Discipleship is all about adherence to Christ. It is always articulated and experienced over and against all other competing claims for our loyalty and allegiance. When diversion and entertainment become a way of life, “we avoid the very issues to which we should be most attentive. We are diverted kultcha-schmultcha from the grim, unpleasant truth that our lives lack meaning without God, that consumption does not satisfy, that the differential between wealth and poverty is unjust, and that the appropriate human response to people in need is sleevesrolled-up service, not simply watching.”22

> My Friends All Have Porsches, and IMust Make Amends...

Now, if you add a third factor into the equation of money and consumerism, that of a phenomenon called status anxiety, we really have quite a potent mix.

Status anxiety originates in that distinct desire of people to climb the social ladder—those certain intangible anxieties that arise from a focus on how we are perceived by others. Alain de Botton, the man who coined the phrase “status anxiety,” claims that chronic anxiety about status is an inevitable side effect of any democratic, supposedly egalitarian society.23 He says that status anxiety stems from the following combination of cultural factors in Western society:

- Lovelessness: Human beings will do just about anything

for love (not just romantic love). We are in constant and deep-seated need of the acceptance and good opinions of others in order to survive. This is especially true of the love of those we consider to be in our peer groups.

The need for this love and the loss of it create what William James calls “a kind of rage and impotent despair... from which the cruelest bodily torture would be a relief.”24

- Expectation: We live in a culture which promises us

that we can have all our needs fulfilled. This message is confirmed through exposure to countless advertisements designed to create an unholy discontent in the consumer the untamed culture and the expectation that only the purchasing of products can fulfill. The result is, of course, anxiety.

- Meritocracy: This is the name for a cultural and social system based on ability. In such a society, rewards (be they wealth, position, or social status) are given to those who exhibit talent and competence, demonstrated through past actions or by competition. Of course, because not all have equal ability, a meritocracy causes as much anxiety and unhappiness as it does happiness.

- Snobbery: Snobs are people who adopt the worldview

that some people are inherently inferior to them for any one of a variety of reasons, including real or supposed intellectual ability, wealth, education, ancestry, and the like. The problem we all face, according to de Botton, is that although we can rely on the unconditional love of our parents, lovers, and certain friends even if we are disgraced and bankrupt, “it is on a diet of the highly conditional attentions of snobs that we are generally forced to subsist.”25 Snobs set the social agenda for all of us, and they are impossible to please. Again, unhappiness is the result.

- Dependence: This form of anxiety comes about from the

feeling that one’s fortunes are dependent on things external to one’s own choice. For instance, we are dependent to a large degree on fickle talent, luck, circumstance, the employer’s moods, profitability, and of course the global economy. Because these are outside our control, they create a distinct form of unhappiness and anxiety.

Any—or a combination—of these can create status anxiety. For instance, when we are part of a group of peers, we are happy to be measured by the standards of the group (Figure A); however, if just one in the group should get a better home, a salary raise, a more beautiful partner, or whatever, things happen in the group (Figure B). kultcha-schmultcha

There are countless ways we might experience a combination of status-induced unhappiness. Our neighbor getting an extension on their house, a new car, or a promotion—any of these things can make us feel inadequate, and we seek to rectify the situation by getting an extension, a car, a promotion; and so it goes, on and on.

However, it is not always through the bigger, more obvious acquisitions that we seek status. It insidiously makes its way into all spheres of our lives. In The Overspent American, Juliet Schor documents a survey conducted on women regarding their purchase of beauty products, from cleansers to lipsticks. Her results show that women will generally spend less money on things like toners and cleansers because they are unseen by the public (usually kept hidden in bathroom cupboards). However, the amount of money women will part with increases dramatically the more conspicuous the makeup products are. The highest and most revered item in a woman’s array of status beauty products is lipstick. Women will spend inordinately more for a lipstick of a known brand because it is the one piece of makeup that is used regularly in full public view: at work, at the table when out to dinner, or in the elevator. The better the brand, the higher the status inferred.

## The Great Reversal

As disciples of the “great reversal” (described in Jesus’s teachings on “the first shall be last, the last first,” “the least of these,” “the servant-master,” and so on), accumulating status should be particularly disturbing to us for a whole host of reasons, which we will get to shortly. We want to comment on a sinister one in particular—the adulation of Christian “celebrities.” The impact of HolUpward Equals Downward lywood and trashy gossip maga- “If people change their reference zines has certainly left its mark group upwards, this can seriously upon us.

We fully appreciate some of the practical realities of this and the honoring of special guests, but we need to be very careful that in providing these things we are not cultivating a culture that is more in line with Hollywood than with the kingdom.
Part of the issue arises when we assign greater importance to more “public” gifts over and above the more “unseen” ones.

This not only creates inequality within the body of Christ but a spiritually dangerous hankering after the so-called greater gifts, with all the affirmation and adulation that goes with them. This is not only very dangerous for people with brittle egos and underdeveloped characters, but when it becomes pathological and an individual resorts to seeking this from the masses in the guise of a spiritual guru, we have the very worst of human nature on show. And that, unfortunately, is often what the world tends to see.

And it shall not be so with you...

Money, obsessions, consumerism-as-spirituality, and status anxiety as the cultural driving force of the day make up the toxic water in which we swim. They impact all of us, no matter what our socioeconomic background. It is too easy for us to see these as issues that affect only the wealthy among us because they have greater purchasing power and therefore the means to acquire and assert influence. The fact is that issues of greed, consumption, and pecking order exist in every human community. Agreat challenge for disciples of Jesus is to dethrone these idols—these “gods” that promise us the world but possess our souls in the bargain. T

As Susan Hope rightly states, the untamed culture

## The Least of These

When Deb worked with the Salvation Army, her first client was a transsexual named Jennifer (not her real name; she has since passed away). Jennifer was a large, unattractive man with breasts and long hair who dressed in female clothing. She had a mild mental disability, a speech impediment, and was fairly aggressive. Needless to say she stood out in a crowd. Jennifer was what you would call a “social outcast”—not someone you naturally desired to hang out with. Yet Deb learned many valuable lessons from her. For all her social poverty she was wonderfully free from the so-called “needs” of normal people. She didn’t care about status, money, or the need to accumulate possessions. Deb can remember a time when she took Jennifer to visit the local shopping mall to buy some gifts the week before Christmas. The mall was packed with people caught up in the consumer frenzy, eager to purchase their items before Christmas. Walking behind Jennifer as they made their way through the crowds, Deb recalls having somewhat of an “epiphany.” Here in the midst of the consumerist frenzy, Jennifer was wonderfully free.
The poor can truly teach us lessons about our own “poverty.” The issue of freedom is a crucial one, especially for Christians involved in mission to a culture where consumerism is the dominant force. Evangelism for such a culture means an Invitation to “change gods” (1 Thess. 1:9). Those who seek to minister Christian freedom must themselves be free.... “You cannot serve God and Mammon,” says Jesus, trenchantly. Justin, in his day, remarked how pagans were turning away from violence and tyranny “because they were drawn to Christians as people whose lives were distinctive and free.” I wonder if twenty-first-century Western Christians are living lives that are clearly distinctive and free as regards possessions.27 This truly is one of the greatest challenges for the church in the twenty-first century. How we deal with these “idols of our times” both personally and communally as the people of God is of utmost importance as we seek to communicate a message of liberation to a world that is by and large enslaved to these very things. To bring an alternative message, we need to ensure that we are endeavoring to live an alternative life. kultcha-schmultcha The clearest way, as far as we can see, to experience this liberation is by understanding and applying the genius of the Beatitudes to our lives. Nothing confronts the idols of our time as Jesus’s great teaching here, and in fact in the whole Sermon on the Mount.

## Matthew 5:2–13 Luke 6:20–30

And he began to teach them, saying: Looking at his disciples, he said: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven. the kingdom of God.

If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.” How contrary are the Beatitudes to the endemic greed and status anxiety that so easily prevail over us! How free from status anxiety is the person who lives by them! According to Jesus, it is such a person who is truly “happy” or “blessed.” But these are inversions of what our society says makes a person happy. Truly the idols have deceived us yet again. F

## Aunt Betty and Uncle Simon

In 1999 we visited Al’s former homeland, South Africa. As this was Al’s first visit back in twelve years, we went to visit some of his family and old friends. We’ll never forget the day we visited old, very wealthy Aunt Betty (not her real name).

After driving up the long, tree-lined driveway to get to her homestead, we were welcomed at the door by her butler—in a tuxedo, no less. While the butler served us tea in beautiful china, Aunt Betty apologized for her husband not being around, for he was on their yacht off the coast of Spain! While kultcha-schmultcha

The tragedy of the Aunt Betty story was highlighted further when we went to visit a wonderful black man named Simon later in that same week. Simon was one of the servants who had worked for many years in Alan’s parents’ hotel, and Al, as a young guy, was particularly close to him.

To get to Simon’s house we had to drive down miles of dirt roads filled with potholes. Along the way children were out laughing and playing, and as we pulled up outside Simon’s house, his whole family was there waiting to greet us. They welcomed us into their very modest brick home, which had basic furniture sitting on a mud floor. We were served coffee in cracked mugs while chickens and children with very worn clothes ran in and out of the house, having the time of their lives. We had never felt so welcomed or embraced. Sharing with his family that afternoon, we came to the profoundly unnerving conclusion that he was one of the happiest, most content people we had ever met.
In the West we often confuse “being poor” with “poverty.” Now let us be clear, we do not believe there is anything good about poverty and wouldn’t want to be seen as idealizing it.

Poverty not only results in the loss of significant choices; it the untamed culture also involves the loss of all human dreams and hopes. But being “poor” economically speaking doesn’t necessarily equal being in “poverty.” What we saw that day with Aunt Betty was something akin to a poverty of the soul, despite all her material wealth. We observed the opposite in Simon: his soul was rich, yet he had nothing in terms of material wealth.

This is often the reverse of what our culture assumes. We are conditioned to think money brings happiness, and though we agree that it certainly may open up doors and bring a degree of comfort and security, these things are temporal and ultimately not of eternal value. Of course, not all wealthy people are unhappy as Aunt Betty was. It depends on what you invest in to find security, identity, and purpose.

In the wonderful, feel-good movie The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will Smith, we find the classic portrayal of an individual triumphing over all obstacles in the pursuit of the American dream. It is a stirring story line, particularly given the fact that it is based on a true story. However, when reflecting a little deeper on the movie, we found that the message undeniably communicated was again that happiness is to be found in financial gain, respectability, and success. We don’t want to diminish the wonderful story told in the movie, but rather want to point out some of our cultural presuppositions that seem to permeate our understanding of where true happiness is found. In The Pursuit of Happyness, money mattered—more so than in many films of a similar genre that set their sights on the poor—largely because Chris’s (Will Smith’s character) pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money.28 In C. S. L

Prosperity knits people to the world. We feel that we are “finding our place in it,” while really it is finding its place in kultcha-schmultcha us. Our increasing reputation, our widening circle of acquaintances, our sense of importance, and the growing pressure of absorbing and agreeable work build up in us a sense of really being at home on Earth, which is just as we want. You will notice that the young are generally less unwilling to die than the middle-aged and the old.29 This should alert us to the dangers of giving our hearts to lesser things. Money, things, and status, despite what our culture might say, are clearly not the answers to a life of peace and contentment—in fact, they are very much part of the problem. The Beatitudes portray another type of truth to us. Many people live out the meaning of the Beatitudes daily and are genuinely happy as a result. People living in today’s Western society—thought to have everything—are over-indulged, over-entertained, and yet are too often the most depressed, bored, anxious generation of all time. A. W. Tozer says, “The blessed ones who possess the Kingdom are they who have repudiated every external thing and have rooted from their hearts all sense of possessing.... This is what the word ‘poor’ as Christ used it actually means. These blessed poor are no longer slaves to the tyranny of things.”30 When we put the Beatitudes into the context of the radical Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7), the truly revolutionary character of the untamed Messiah’s way comes to the forefront. If we simply lived this little section of New Testament Scripture out, we would literally change the world. Approximately 30 percent of the world’s population identifies itself as Christian. Think about it—what if 30 percent of the world’s people simply took the Sermon on the Mount seriously and applied it to life? What do you think would happen? Or if that seems too far-fetched, know that over 50 percent of Americans claim to believe in Jesus. What if 50 percent of America took Jesus with utmost seriousness and sought to live out his message faithfully? What do you think would happen?
Authentic missional Christianity not only reclaims and redeems culture through incarnational engagement as Jesus did, but also imperils the culture in which it manifests itself, in exactly the same way the early disciples did to the Roman Empire. When we experience deep liberation from idols by the King, we become aware that we do not have to squander and dissipate our lives on things that don’t matter. Following Jesus in the power of the Spirit, we are freed to be the good news to a world around us captive to sin. We can live with no regrets knowing that in seeking first the rule of God, all things are ours.

We’ll let U2’s Bono have the last word here: “In order to serve our world, we must betray it.”

## Suggested Practices

- Watch The Matrix series again: Movies, especially scifi, tend to contain powerful critiques of culture and act as warnings to us by suggesting a future that is all too possible. In many ways, this is the function of biblical eschatology (doctrine of the end times).

- Be generous until it hurts: Generosity is one of the most

powerful ways to break the power of money in our lives and (re)introduce grace into the equation.

- Humble yourselves: The incarnation of God in Jesus

is a powerful demonstration of the truth that God is humble. Also, we learn from this that we too are called to a life that is “downwardly mobile”—instead of the so-called “upwardly mobile” way of the world. Status anxiety arises from the constant comparisons we make between ourselves and others. To overcome this toxic aspect of culture, practice the Beatitudes. kultcha-schmultcha

- Simplify your life: We can honestly live with a lot less

“stuff” in our lives. Actually, there is a worldwide movement to downgrade our lifestyles called “The Manifesto for Well being.” Aspects of it include doing meaningful work (not just money-related), limiting work hours to thirty-five-hour weeks, spending more quality time with the children, discouraging materialism, promoting responsible advertising, building communities and relationships, and more. Check it out on http://www. wellbeingmanifesto. net/.

- No advertising: Cut back on exposure to desire-producing

advertising. Limit the TV or, even more radically, practice a “TV fast” for some period of time. If it doesn’t kill you, it’s going to make you a whole lot better.

## Discussion Starters

1. “If everyone lives roughly the same lies about the same

things, then there is no one to call them lies; they jointly establish their own sanity and call themselves normal” (Ernest Becker). Is this true? If so, how can we avoid collective deception, especially as it relates to middleclass values?

2. What can the story of Jennifer (and people like her)

in the text box found <!-- Page 126 --> teach us about ourselves?

3. How has consumerism damaged you, your church, and

your Christian witness in the world?

4. Is money a neutral force in your life? Discuss how much

of your life revolves around acquiring it and what effects it has on you, your family, your church, and your church’s mission. the untamed culture

5. What would a perfect human existence look like? What

can you do now to try to make this happen?

6. Read Dave Andrews’s Plan Be: Be the Change You Want

See in the World. This is a wonderful book on the Beatitudes about changing ourselves and our worlds.
