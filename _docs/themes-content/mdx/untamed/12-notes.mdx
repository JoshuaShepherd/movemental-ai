7. For a thorough exploration of idolatry, image-making, and its consequences

see Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit, Idolatry (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992); and more recently G. K. Beale, We Become What We Worship: A Biblical Theology of Idolatry (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 2008).

8. Many would by now be concerned that we are somehow undermining all

forms of religious art. And in some ways, and for the reasons above, we do believe that Scripture puts limits on attempts to represent God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. But we also strongly believe in the validity of art and its attempt to symbolically portray truth in visual form. So in order to avoid image-making, we would suggest that Christian artists should direct their attention on events in the Bible and issues of the theological significance of texts, rather than on trying to image God in any way. And when trying to communicate understandings of God, that they use abstract and symbolic means, rather than attempts to capture him in images. In such cases, God ends up looking like an old, angry man, and Jesus ends up religious, spooky, racially defined, or culturally co-opted. And how can one adequately represent the Holy Spirit except symbolically? Such art cannot fully honor the revelation of God in Jesus. Besides, the way monotheistic believers are to reflect specifically on God is not through the image (for reasons explained above), but rather through the language/word and through remembrance and story.

10. Hirsch and Frost, Re Jesus, 12–13. Many representations of Jesus portray

him as idealized humanity, highlighting the softer virtues—the more caring, gentle aspects of his nature. The wild-eyed Prophet seems to give way to either the overly cosmic Jesus or to the overly genteel vision of who he is.

11. O’Brien, “AJesus for Real Men.” O’Brien goes on to say, quite rightly,

“Most importantly, Scripture gives no indication that Jesus came to earth to model masculinity. He is the ‘image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation’ (Col. 1:15). As such, he is not simply the perfect male; he is the perfect human being. Through his obedience to the Father, Christ exhibited the qualities that should characterize all believers, both male and female.”

For instance, the Cold War demonstrated, on a global scale, what is at stake regarding our fundamental ideas regarding human nature, human community, human aspirations, and human destiny. If we fought over ideas that relate to humanity, how much more do ideas about God have ramifications in society and in the human soul.

7. If that is what radical I slamists believe, then at least in their own frame of

reference, they are justified in believing that God can command anything, even the irrational. “And so contemporary Jihadists believe that the murder of innocents is not simply morally acceptable, but morally required, if such murders advance the cause of I slam. The same is true for lying—it is allowed in a Jihad if it advances its cause. And so we see that the origins of the lethal weapon of the ‘homicide bomber’ of our day are rooted in a defective, impassive concept of God” (ibid., 47, 50, 56).

combination of a number of factors, namely, the intersection between “orthopathy,” orthopraxy, and orthodoxy. See Hirsch and Frost, Re Jesus, ch. 6.

18. As Emile Durkheim shows, idols are in effect a projection of our social

identity. God, who is beyond creation, cannot be limited to an image, an act of human creation or imagination. In fact, it is humans themselves who are made in the image and likeness of God. And “because idols estrange their servants from their own image of God, [they] lead them further from who they truly are into the void of falsehood” (Telford Work, Deuteronomy, Brazos Theological Commentary of the Bible [Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2009], 61).

20. See “Cognitive Dissonance” at http://www. ethicsscoreboard. com/rb_defini

tions. html. In other words, dissonance is the inherent discomfort resulting from experiencing two or more mental events (beliefs, attitudes, values, perceptions) that are incompatible with each other. This relates directly to the New Testament teaching on conscience: it’s for good reason that the Bible talks about guarding the conscience and being careful not to sear it (e. g., Acts 23:1; 24:16; Rom. 9:1; 2 Cor.

1:12). Conscience is not always the best guide to the knowledge of God because it can be culturally conditioned, but going against conscience is almost always a bad idea (e. g., 1 Cor. 8:7, 10; 1 Tim. 1:19–20).

28. In The Forgotten Ways, Alan suggests that the marks, or identifiers, of

an authentic church include the following elements: (1) a covenant community (2) centered on Jesus as the Mediator, Savior, and Lord, (3) the encounter with Whom results in (4) worship (offering our worlds back to God through Jesus), (5) mission (extending the work of Jesus as agents of his Kingdom), and (6) discipleship (following Jesus and becoming like him).

17. Alan notes in The Forgotten Ways,

Much of that which goes by the name advertising is an explicit offer of a sense of identity, meaning, purpose, and community. Most ads now appeal to one or more of these religious dimensions of life. Take for instance a recent car ad targeting twenty-somethings in which we are introduced to a fantastic group of very cool people singing along in a car and generally having a great time. Throughout the ad, nothing is mentioned about the qualities of a car, its technical ingenuity, its availability, its price; rather the advert is an explicit appeal to the need for people to be accepted as cool people. The selling point on the ad is an offer of community, status, and acceptance by groovy people: if the consumer would just purchase this vehicle they will have achieved this. Analyzed in a religious way, we could see just about all advertising in this light. B

The astute cultural commentator Douglas Rushkoff in his PBS documentary on consumerism, The Persuaders, has noted that advertisers and marketers are now learning from religion in order to sell products. Marketers have now co-opted the language and symbolism of all the major religions in order to sell the product because they know that religion offers the ultimate object of desire and that people will do just about anything to get it. If through advertising marketers can just link their products to this great unfilled void, they will sell. An advertising executive recently confessed to Alan that they are now deliberately stepping into the void that was left by the vacation of Christianity from Western culture. (107)

1. And actually, it’s not as complex as one might think at first. For instance,

the average reader of this book will have about ninety people in their orbit of meaningful relationships—some more, some less, depending on the amount of extroversion. When we come to Christ and become a disciple, it is not inconceivable that a certain percentage of those people will come to faith as well. Your relationships redeemed constitute an ecclesia as the Bible defines it. It doesn’t need all the paraphernalia we’ve come to associate with the concept of “church.”

chapter 7 the lying mirror

1. There are numerous books that deal with Kierkegaard’s teaching in this regard. Good summaries can be found in David Gouwens, Kierkegaard as Religious Thinker (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), ch. 3; and Frederic Sontag, A Kierkegaard Handbook (Atlanta: John Knox, 1989), 128–36. Kierkegaard’s views of self and despair are echoed in almost all major Christian thinkers after him, including C. S. Lewis, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonheoffer, and Reinhold Niebuhr. For instance, consider this from C. S. Lewis: “From the moment a creature becomes aware of God as God and itself as self, the terrible alternative of choosing God or self for the center is opened to it. This sin is committed daily by young children and ignorant peasants as well as by sophisticated persons, by solitaries no less than by those who live in society; it is the fall in every individual life, and in each day of each individual life, the basics behind all particular sins; at this very moment you and I are either committing it, or about to commit it, or repenting it” (C. S

Lewis, The Problem of Pain, quoted in Clyde Kilby, A Mind Awake, 112).

2. Shirley Lyn Scott, “What Makes Serial Killers Tick? http://www. trutv. com/

library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/psych_6. html. The following are environmental factors, psychiatrists say, which can create a sociopath: studies show that sixty percent of psychopathic individuals had lost a parent; the child is deprived of love or nurturing; parents are detached or absent; inconsistent discipline—if father is stern and mother is soft, the child learns to hate authority and manipulate his or her mother; and hypocritical parents who privately belittle the child while publicly presenting the image of a “happy family.”

9. It is helpful here to remove the role of “discipling” from the confines of the

church walls. In the Great Commission we are exhorted to go therefore and make disciples; we believe this to mean that we are called to disciple every person we encounter on the journey of life. Again, another way of looking at it is to “call forth the image of God” within every person. The role of “discipling” will, of course, vary from person to person, depending on our relationship with them and if they have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior. We have found the categories “pre-” and “post-conversion” discipleship helpful.

12. The full quote is as follows: “Sexuality and spirituality are not, of course,

exactly the same thing. They are not identical twins, but they are kissing cousins, and they arise out of the same kind of ground, not only in myth but in actual notes human experience. The fact is that sex is the closest that many people ever come to a spiritual experience. Indeed, it is because it is a spiritual experience of sorts that so many chase after it with a repetitive, desperate kind of abandon. Often, whether they know it or not, they are searching for God. It is no accident that even atheists and agnostics will, at the moment of orgasm, routinely cry out, ‘Oh God!’” (M. S
