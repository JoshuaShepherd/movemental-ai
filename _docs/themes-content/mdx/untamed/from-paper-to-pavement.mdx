# From Paper to Pavement

## Believing and Being the Gospel

The Pharisees were religious students. They consumed the old covenant Law and thrived on it. They could quote it verbatim, interpret it and explain its fine points.

They could do anything except live it!

> After leaving work on a chilly February night in the Bronx, New York, thirty-one-year-old social worker Julio Diaz followed a daily routine as he hopped off the subway train and headed home.

The platform appeared empty as he approached the stairs leading to the street, and he hardly noticed the teenage boy stepping from the shadows to confront him, knife in hand.

With the young man demanding money, Julio pulled out his wallet and handed it over.

Something extraordinary happened next. As the boy began walking away, Diaz hollered to him, "Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something. If you're going to be robbing people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep you warm." The awestruck teenager couldn't believe his ears, and a few minutes later the two of them were sharing a warm meal at Julio's favorite diner, where the youngster not only returned Julio's wallet but handed him his hold-up knife as well. The conversation at the diner was dominated by the young man's questions as to why Julio was so nice to everyone. "Even the dishwasher." The answer is that Julio had incarnated Jesus' words:

> Love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer for that person. If someone slaps you in the face, giftwrap your best coat and make a present of it. If someone takes unfair advantage of you, use the occasion to practice the servant life. No more tit-for-tat stuff. Live generously. (Luke 6:27–30 Message)

> The late John Wimber was known for holding a Bible up and saying, "The problem with the Bible is that you can't make it do anything until you do what it says." Wimber was right. In many ways the Bible is very much like a cookbook. We read about the ingredients of our lives in it and allow it to take over our lives. Only when we do what it says in real feet-to-the-pavement living, we can experience a kingdom that transforms us and our world. If we don't let this happen, the words of the Bible remain as dormant as the recipes in an unopened cookbook. They languish as possibilities, ideas, and options.

The apostle John gives instructions in the simplest phrase possible, "Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did" (1 John 2:6). In the words of a friend, "It ain't rocket surgery." It is not about trying to do what Jesus would do.

Rather, it has to do with thinking the way Jesus thinks in order to live the way Jesus lived. Dallas Willard said, "Another important way of putting this is to say that I am learning from Jesus to live my life as he would live my life if he were I. I am not necessarily learning to do everything he did, but I am learning how to do everything I do in the manner that he did all that he did."1

Philosopher Jacques Ellul has said, "We have to admit that there is an immeasurable distance between all that we read in the Bible and the practice of the church and of Christians." It is impossible to legitimately follow the biblical Jesus and not end up being molded by the mission of God and a growing reflection of Jesus' character. When our hearts and minds are truly seized by the Lord, we cannot but help to see people, the world, even the church, differently.

We should seriously consider how we treat the telemarketer who upsets us by calling at dinnertime. We should ask, "How is Jesus in me wanting to deal with this person? It is about treating a waiter or waitress the way Jesus would, or helping out a struggling next-door neighbor the way the Word of God speaks to treating a neighbor. This is simply but profoundly about being the way Jesus is. It is about driving our cars with patience and courtesy in the same way Jesus would drive.

That very thought is something we all should chew on. In fact, when I was pastoring, someone in our church wanted to have bumper stickers printed with the name of our church on them. I told this person I wouldn't stand for it, because I had seen some of our people (myself included) in traffic. It would have made for bad advertising.

Reading the Bible is as much about letting the Bible read us as it is about us reading it. "For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart" (Heb. 4:12). This can only happen by coming to the Bible in a dialogical posture, not reading it as if it were a monological stone tablet. We should sit down with the Word of God as we would with a close friend or confidant, sharing conversation and coffee. The power of Scripture comes to life when we give ourselves to its message in the real living of our lives, letting it analyze us even more than we analyze it. Alan and coauthor Mike Frost say it well here:

Any conversation must allow for both sides to communicate, and this most unfamiliar act is allowing oneself to be open to hearing God speak. One of the biases that we bring to the Bible, and one that blocks the possibility of true conversation, is the assumption that we read it. We are the active party. The Jewish approach to Scripture is that we don't read the Bible but rather that it reads us! Our standard practice is to assume we are its interpreter and therefore the arbiter of its meaning. Jewish approaches reverse this: we are not the interpreter, but rather it is the Torah that interprets us. This is because it is God who addresses us in Scripture; hence the idea of revelation that is so important to a biblical worldview.

"It is not so much that we raise questions about him, but that he raises questions of us."2 This has a transformative effect on us as we take consistent doses to renew our thoughts to the mind of Christ.

This is a change from feeding on to fellowshipping with the Word of God. It consistently has a power to calibrate thought processes to the thinking pattern of the Lord, but it is only activated when we act on it. Mere exposure to it does not change us into agents of the kingdom.

Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. (James 1:22–24)

## Jesus Time

For as long as I can remember I have had a routine like a lot of believers maintain where I spend a bit of time in the morning in the Bible and prayer. For me, there is usually a cup of coffee at hand, a groggy dog at foot, and a guitar nearby to spend a little time in praise and worship. It dawned on me a few years back that I had fallen into a pattern that in effect had me leaving Jesus in that quiet-time corner each morning as I embarked on my daily duties. It was as if I was saying, "Well, gotta' get goin'. Great hanging with you, Lord. See ya tomorrow." It had become somewhat routinized, and it was as if I was leaving Jesus in the book, bookmarked and all.

Now, consciously I was not intending to do that, but practically speaking that is exactly what I was doing. My daily Bible reading duty was checked off the list. It was much like the old-time Country and Western radio shows where thirty minutes of songs about drunkenness, fighting, and fornication would be interrupted as the host drew a serious tone and announced, "It's now sacred time on our show." Everything would slow down and what would follow would be a solemn old-time gospel song. As soon as it was over? Bam! Back to singing about bar fights and kickin' out the footlights. I felt that I was doing something like that... giving Jesus a daily token acknowledgment, then going about my own agenda and pursuits.

Consistently feeding on the Word of God is important, and in that regard my routine had great value. But something very positive happened when I realized how I was limiting the Lord in my life. This had to do with my approach to the Bible, the "why" of my purpose for reading it in the first place. It had become a type of daily booster shot—you know, a "chapter a day keeps the devil away." When I realized this, I began to approach the Bible with an aim of being transformed into a missional person who would live that day with a goal of incarnating the Word for others, of being good news wherever I went. I decided I would no longer leave Jesus stuck in the corner and on the pages of the book. It began to change everything.

Approaching the Bible in this way turns into a daily invitation for Jesus to join us in our routines. My day becomes our day when we seek to incarnate the Word in the here and now of our days and weeks. This, in a way, is letting our flesh become the Word. In my own walk I've made certain passages a "make this verse flesh" goal for each day. Verses such as, "Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the bones" (Prov. 16:24 NKJV) become a challenge to make them come alive. For me, it has become a goal to respond with healthy, pleasant, sweet-to-the-soul words to others—telemarketers and license bureau workers included. Notice I said that this is a goal. I am the first to admit that many days I fail, but it is one of my daily missional goals. Having a conscious challenge brings it into measurable focus.

This is the posture that Lesslie Newbigin commended when he said, "It is possible to indwell the Bible story so that you do not so much look at the Bible from without as look at the world from within the Bible, through the lenses that the Bible gives you."3 This is another way of describing the adoption of a biblical worldview. Newbigin's suggestion takes the position of placing ourselves inside the Word and working our lives out from that position—like looking through a new set of glasses. As we read a section of Scripture, we think through how to contextualize it in our own lives.

So one of the questions we can ask ourselves each day as we read the Bible is, "What situations, people, or issues, in my life right now or where I will find myself today, are similar to what I have just read?" We then look for the appropriate actions, words, or response from the key players in that passage and think and pray through how we might live out the truth of the Word in our parcel of the world.

This actually adds a bit of lab, or homework, to our Bible study. Jewish philosopher Martin Buber spoke of the mistake so many scholars make. They objectify the Bible, turning it into ideology and Sunday Schooled head knowledge alone, moving from what he called an I-and-Thou stance toward an I-and-It relation to the Scriptures. When we objectify it in this way—when it effectively becomes an object, an "It"—we remain firmly in control and are not changed by encountering the living Word. People are not convinced by teaching but by encounter. Doctrine follows as a way of explaining the impact of the encounter.

Not long ago my teenage son and I were driving from St. Louis to Milwaukee when we stopped off for breakfast at a fast-food joint. It was a Sunday morning and the place was woefully understaffed. One poor guy was working the kitchen and there was a middle-aged woman covering both the front counter and the drive-thru. As we walked in, eyeing the situation, I whispered, "Uh oh."

There were literally only two people working the early morning breakfast rush. Between labored breaths and without looking up, the lady apologized to the half dozen or so of us who were in line and explained that two other workers had either called in sick or just failed to show up for work.

Despite their hopeless situation, these two workers buzzed like bees and worked as hard and fast as humanly possible to serve a line of cars outside and a growing stream of customers inside. Fortunately everyone in line was very patient and understanding of the situation, not laying blame on these two people who had faithfully shown up for work. Everyone, that is, except for one guy. Near the front of the line was a man who was probably in his middle fifties, dressed to the nines, and holding his Sunday school lesson in hand, obviously headed to church.

Shortly after placing his order, the guy was leaning on the counter, grunting, groaning, weight shifting from foot to foot, and watching every move of the two workers with steely eyes and pursed lips, as if they were handling the delivery of his firstborn. After a few minutes he literally shouted at the two desperate workers, "I would please like to have my food now so that I can get going!" With teary eyes and flushed cheeks, the lady working the counter maintained her composure and apologized for the delay, although it was obvious to everyone she was on the brink of a dam burst of tears and in the midst of an impossible situation. As this church-bound "saint" stomped out of the restaurant, the disgust of everyone else in the place was evident. Not a person said a word, but thought balloons were floating over everyone's head: "Jerk!" "What an ass." "Hypocrite." "Typical Christian." "Geeze—and the dude's goin' to church." It was clear to everyone where this guy was in such a hurry to get to.

After Sunday School Sam departed, the place was silent and the atmosphere was thick with an undercurrent of sadness rippled with anger. I did the only thing I knew to do at the moment and that was to voice appreciation to the two workers for their great effort. "You guys are doing great, I don't know how you're doing it, but I think you deserve a raise. Hopefully that guy meets Jesus when he gets to church!" This broke the tension, and a few other people pitched in their agreement to the affirmation, and like a person under water for too long and finally breaking the surface, the lady at the counter let out a sigh of relief and gave a thankful smile.

It was easy. I just seized the opportunity to live out the verse from Proverbs that I had been focusing on—"Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the bones." The atmosphere had instantly changed. I thought at any moment munchkins were going to jump out and start singing, "The witch is dead, the wicked, wicked witch is dead!" This is not an isolated scenario. My two daughters worked at a fast-food restaurant, and their most dreaded day to work was Sundays because, they said, the most belligerent customers were the church folk. I still am not sure that is the case, but at the very least I know it seemed that way because they expected more out of Christians. Most of us who have known anyone in the restaurant business have heard that Christians are usually the least generous when it comes to tipping. The scenarios just described are very real examples of why Christians are not generally viewed as good news people by the general population. Too often, their actions and presence are old news or, even worse, bad news. Steve Sjogren seeks to counter this as he implores his flock to tip 25 percent in restaurants on Sundays as a missional practice/discipline.

Imagine the impact we can make by doing the same and focusing always on being God's good news people in restaurants, cafés, and any place we shop. Brennan Manning says: In the last analysis, faith is not the sum of our beliefs or a way of speaking or a way of thinking; it is a way of living and can be articulated adequately only in a living practice. To acknowledge Jesus as Savior and Lord is meaningful insofar as we try to live as he lived and to order our lives according to his values.4 Alan is fond of saying that the gospel is like a virus we sneeze on others. I know that might be a rather gross analogy, but it really is much like that. The gospel needs a host, a carrier, to get spread around. The power of the gospel is activated when we add our flesh and blood to it as Jesus did.

Too often we quarantine it in our systems. Compartmentalizing Christian life into church attendance and church activity and between the covers of our Bibles is an incapacitating straitjacket that pervades Christianity. It not only limits our ability to get the message across; in many ways, it is counterproductive. It parks, or stores, the movement ethos that lies within the very message of the gospel in the first place. But as we allow the Word of God access to our hands, our lips, our time and resources, it is unleashed. It moves freely and powerfully into the streams of our daily lives and throughout neighborhoods and communities. And so we become God's good news people, giving Jesus the right to live through us to our lives.

This is the very essence of what it means to have a missional approach to the Bible. As we study the Scripture, we ask, "How does God's Word call, shape, transform, and send me out into the world today?" We are praying, "Lord, I don't want to just read this passage and leave unchanged by it. Let me not just feed myself from this daily bread but help me feed others with it also."

Engagement with Jesus must move us beyond being spectators to participants. If we wish to become like him, we must learn to participate in Jesus, actively applying him and his teachings right here, right now. We cannot be disinterested spectators when it comes to following Jesus. In fact, in the encounters described in the New Testament, the desire of people to remain neutral observers is in a sense the real sin (e.g., the rich young ruler and Pilate). The Pharisees want to "check him out," objectify him, line him up against their understandings of the faith, and because of this they are judged for their hardness of heart, for holding themselves back from what God is doing in Jesus. It is those who allow Jesus to get into their hearts and heads who end up entering the kingdom.

## Feed Me

Pastors are aware that one of the common critiques uttered by Christians who leave their churches is "I just wasn't being fed." Any guy or gal who has been involved in leading a church for any amount of time has heard this countless times. This sentiment comes from the desire for more and better teaching, either in Bible studies or through better sermons. Many Christians believe the inner hunger they feel will be satiated by more Bible study or through hearing sermons. They are convinced their spiritual strength or lack thereof is the responsibility of the pastor-preacher. I believe their hunger is very real, a gnawing lack of fulfillment and desire for more, but I do not believe it is for lack of teaching.

Several years ago, when the Bible Codebook was the big buzz, from time to time church members would approach me and ask what I thought about the Bible code. I usually replied that I had not really given it any thought, but once we figured out how to live the Gospel Code, then we would look into it. My trite answer belies the fact that I am convinced that most of the books such as this not only fail to produce any substantive maturity in the body of Christ, they actually serve as diversionary devices to keep Christians mesmerized by anything other than the simple but rarely seen gospel-lived life. More knowledge and teaching is not going to do the trick... it is in living out the words of the Bible that the life of God begins to take root in us and spring up.

Jesus didn't say, "Come and study me." He said, "Come and follow me." It is through practicing what we study from the Bible in the laboratory of daily life that transformation happens in our own lives and we become a blessing to others. Bible study is not only important, it is absolutely vital and essential, and neither Alan nor I minimize its place in the daily rhythm of following Jesus. But the point here is that it is only the first step in feasting with the Lord on a daily basis, and just because we've studied something from the Bible doesn't mean the lesson is learned or complete. It has just begun.

## Believing in Jesus

In what is my favorite scene from The Andy Griffith Show, my favorite television series of all time, Opie, Andy Taylor's son, has been caught in an impossible-to-believe tale. The storyline has Opie frequently coming home with various items such as a hand ax and an old quarter. When asked where he has acquired the items, he tells of Mr. Mc Beevee, a man who walks in the treetops and wears a shiny silver hat, has 12 extra hands, blows smoke from his ears, and jingles when he walks. Clearly Opie has dreamed up the mystical Mr. Mc Beevee in order to cover up the truth that he has actually stolen the ax and the money.

The most poignant scene in the episode has Andy attempting to pry the truth from his son as he sternly instructs Opie to simply confess that Mr. Mc Beevee is make-believe and all will be forgotten. The writer's script reads:

Opie makes a decision. He shrugs, speaks in a weary monotone.

OPIE Mr. Mc Beevee... is only make-...

ANDY Say it.

Opie makes a difficult decision.

OPIE I can't, Paw. Mr. Mc Beevee isn't make-believe. He's real.

Andy looks at the boy's upturned face. Now comes the fateful question.

OPIE (continuing) Don't you believe me?

Andy pauses. He wants to postpone facing the all-important question.

OPIE Don't you, Paw?

It's the moment of decision.

Andy is troubled. He looks at the earnest face. Then the answer is there. Andy's sternness relaxes. He finds a strange peace within him as he reaches out to take Opie's hand.

ANDY I believe you.5

Andy leaves the boy in his room, slowly descends the stairs, and is met by his sidekick, Barney, who presses him on the need to punish Opie for what is an "obvious lie" by asking him if he himself believes in the far-fetched Mr. Mc Beevee.

Andy lights a cigarette as he ponders the situation. Slowly and wistfully he says, "No... no... but I do believe in Opie." In a last-ditch effort to make sense of it all, Andy goes out to the woods where Opie claims Mr. Mc Beevee walks in the treetops and ruefully says to no one in particular, "Mr. Mc Beevee." At this point a voice overhead answers, "Hello, somebody call?!" and Mr. Mc Beevee, a telephone company lineman, descends a tree, wearing a shiny hat, and with 12 tools hanging from his belt that jingle at the slightest move, puts out his hand, smiles, and gleefully greets Andy, "Mc Beevee at your service, what can I do for you!" Because of his unwavering belief in Opie, Andy just had to work out the answer to what seemed to be an unbelievable story. It wasn't enough to say, "I believe in Opie," and leave it at that. It was the very fact that Andy did believe in his son that pushed him to pursue the truth of Opie's words.

When we believe in someone, it means we believe in what they say and our actions prove that we do. You can't have one without the other. On the other hand, I can believe that a politician exists, but that doesn't necessarily mean I believe in the politician. I can believe that a car salesman exists but still not believe in him.

A lot of Christians demonstrate by their attitudes, actions, and interactions with others that they believe Jesus existed, but they fall way short of demonstrating that they believe in him. It is up to us to look at our pattern of day-to-day living and ask if our lives corroborate our stated belief in Jesus. Statistical studies consistently reveal no discernable difference in the way Christians live their lives in comparison to non-Christians.

German theologian Johann Metz carries this thought further: If we are to trust the gospel testimonies, it goes through people like a shock, reaching deep down into the direction their lives are taking, into their established system of needs, and so finally into the situations in society they have helped to create; it damages and disrupts ones' own self-interests and aims at a fundamental revision of one's habitual way of life. The crisis (or sickness) of life in the church is not just that the change of heart is not taking place or not taking place quickly enough, but that the absence of this change of heart is being further concealed under the appearance of a merely believed-in faith. Are we Christians in this country really changing our hearts, or do we just believe in a change of hearts and remain under the cloak of this belief in conversion basically unchanged? Are we living as disciples, or do we just believe in discipleship and, under the cloak of this belief in discipleship, continue in our old ways, the same unchanging ways? Do we show real love, or do we just believe in love and under the cloak of belief in love remain the same egoists and conformists we have always been? Do we share the sufferings of others, or do we just believe in this sharing, remaining under the cloak of a belief in "sympathy" as apathetic as ever?6

When referring to knowing God, the OT often uses the word yada. This word derives from the idea of personal intimacy between people and can be used to describe sexual intercourse. It refers to a deeply subjective form of knowledge where intellectual barriers are overcome and the immeasurable distance between knower and known is finally bridged: it approximates what the later mystics would call "union with God." Mere objective knowledge leaves the knower uncommitted, but truly knowing God, in the deepest biblical sense, can only be gained by a thoroughly personal, existential involvement, and through a self-giving that is rooted in the total self-giving which is the very life of God.

## Believing Jesus

Do you just believe in Jesus or do you also believe Jesus? I ask this question neither rhetorically nor with cynicism but to point out the monumental difference between the two. If we harbor any realistic hope of making an impact on our world right here and right now, our lives must manifest the fruit of believing what Jesus said about how to live and love. Our intellectual and theological constructs fail miserably at bringing us into the freedom, glory, and power of the Word made flesh. Brennan Manning pulls no punches when he says: The problem with all this intellectualizing is that it allowed us to wrap the crucified Christ up in words. As we focused on theology, we separated ourselves from his humanity. We marked him only for our minds, so there was never any pressure in our guts to change our lives.7

> It may be that we have actually placed more faith in the Bible than we have in Jesus. I fully believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, but I also believe that the majority of Christians have a Bible-faith rather than a Jesus-faith. Robert Webber address it this way: The primary problem we evangelicals have inherited from the Enlightenment is its emphasis on the foundational nature of Scripture. The church has from its very beginning confessed that Jesus Christ is the foundation of faith: "No one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 3:11). This foundation of Christianity is the incarnation of God into our humanity to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves: Defeat the powers of evil and restore the creation in the new heavens and the new earth.

It was during the Enlightenment that the foundation of the Christian faith shifted from the centrality of the person and work of Jesus Christ to the centrality of the Bible. Theology shifted from the God who acts to the God who spoke. In the worst scenario faith shifted from trust in Christ to trust in the Book. Therefore, the first question we must address as evangelicals in a postmodern world is this: Do we believe in a book or a person?8

Jesus is the one who brought this issue up in the first place in one of his classic confrontations with a group of religious persecutors: You do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He sent. You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life. (John 5:38–40 NASB)

Jesus made it very clear that it is possible to frequently go to the Bible and remain "unwilling to come to [him]." The Pharisees and leaders of the synagogues proved this. No one before or since could come close to matching the Pharisees' knowledge and devotion to the Scriptures. The real issue here has to do with obeying the Word. More study does not always lead to deeper obedience. Again, the menu isn't the meal.

Studying the menu will not provide nourishment nor curb hunger. The twentieth-century martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer said: Since he is the Christ, he must make it clear from the start that his word is not an abstract doctrine, but the re-creation of the whole life of man. The only right and proper way is quite literally to go with Jesus. The road to faith passes through obedience to the call of Jesus. Unless a definite step is demanded, the call vanishes into thin air, and if men imagine that they can follow Jesus without taking this step, they are deluding themselves like fanatics.9

## Just Think It?

When we speak of Jesus as the incarnation, we are agreeing with John's statement that Jesus was the Word of God made into flesh (John 1:14). This is the heart of our message as Christians, the belief that Jesus both fulfilled and reveals God's intention for humans and the world. He is the prototypical human being, and if people want to know how God feels about them, they should be able to listen and look to God's good news people giving life to his Word in order to get the right message.

Theologically thick words sometimes do more harm than good in conveying a meaning, but we may find them helpful on this point. Orthodoxy conveys the idea of right thinking. Orthopraxy speaks to the issue of right action. The globally successful Nike shoe campaign of years ago would have failed miserably if it had said, "Just Think It." "Just Do It" carried much more punch. As Alan and Mike conveyed in The Shaping of Things to Come, "It is our contention that by focusing on the development of the speculative doctrines, the early church lost the vital focus on the historical and practical implications of the faith. Mission and discipleship as such became marginal to theological correctness. Orthopraxy gave way to orthodoxy."10

> IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FORMING A MISSIONAL LIFESTYLE
> Pray—
> - During your morning or evening time in the Bible, pray the Lord will send you out in the Spirit of what you have read.

> Imagine—
> - Concentrate on what it means to "believe Jesus" in light of what you are facing today or this week. Think about the connection between your situation and how Jesus' words relate to it.

> Ask—
> - Formulate a set of questions to take with you to your reading of the Bible. A couple suggestions:
>   - "What would it look like in my life if I made these words flesh today?"
>   - "What orthopraxy is connected to the orthodoxy I am seeing here?"
