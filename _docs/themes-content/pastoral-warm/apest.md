# APEST

## Short description

Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—the fivefold ministry Christ gave for the maturity and mission of his body. Explore 5Q and how to activate all five forms of intelligence in your community.

## Long description

Ephesians 4 names five gifts Christ gave to the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. APEST isn’t just a list of roles—it’s a framework for the kinds of intelligence and ministry the whole body needs to thrive. In *5Q* and *The Permanent Revolution* you’ll discover how these five functions work as a system, why the church has often operated with only two (Shepherd and Teacher), and how to create an environment where all five are valued and released. This theme is for leaders and teams ready to move from “ST” to the full fivefold expression of the body of Christ.
