# Comprehensive Q&A — APEST

## Category: What is APEST?

### What is APEST?
APEST is the fivefold ministry framework from Ephesians 4:11: Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher. In 5Q these are understood as five forms of intelligence (5Q) distributed throughout the body, not only leadership roles. *Source: faq-003.*

### What is 5Q?
5Q is the “fivefold intelligence”—the expanded understanding of APEST as organizational and personal intelligence. Every believer carries all five; the church needs all five operating for the “fullness of Christ.” *Source: 5Q (book).*

### Why are Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist often “exiled”?
The Western church has tended to operate with mainly Shepherd and Teacher (the “ST” model), creating stability but also stasis. APE functions are change agents; when they’re missing, the church struggles with adaptation and mission. *Source: 5Q, The Permanent Revolution.*

## Category: The five functions

### What does each function do?
- **Apostle (AQ):** Pioneering, extending, multiplying, architecting.
- **Prophet (PQ):** Discerning, challenging, calling to faithfulness, exposing falsehood.
- **Evangelist (EQ):** Recruiting, proclaiming, connecting people to the cause.
- **Shepherd (SQ):** Nurturing, protecting, building community, belonging.
- **Teacher (TQ):** Grounding, explaining, equipping, preserving truth.
*Source: 5Q; faq-003.*

### Are APEST functions only for Christians?
No. They appear as universal archetypes in human culture (business, arts, politics) because they reflect the image of God. They are fully revealed and redeemed in Christ and given to the church. *Source: 5Q.*

## Category: Activation

### How do I activate APEST in my context?
Assess which functions are present and which are suppressed. Value and release all five; avoid over-relying on ST. Use 5Q tools and *The Permanent Revolution* for implementation. *See faq-012, practical-guides how-to-activate-apest-5q.*

### What are the fivefold marks of the church?
Apostolic (missional), prophetic (holy and just), evangelistic (proclaiming good news), shepherding (reconciled community), teaching (wisdom and truth). They serve as metrics for health. *Source: 5Q.*
