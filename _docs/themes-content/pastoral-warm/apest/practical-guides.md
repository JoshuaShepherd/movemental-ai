# Practical guides — APEST

## Roadmaps

### 1. Activating APEST in your context
- **Step 1:** Introduce the five functions (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) and the idea that everyone carries all five.
- **Step 2:** Assess: Which functions are visible and valued? Which are exiled or undervalued?
- **Step 3:** Create space for APE functions (pioneering, discerning, recruiting) as well as ST (nurturing, teaching).
- **Step 4:** Use 5Q assessment or similar to help people discover their profile; deploy accordingly.
- **Step 5:** Align structures and culture so all five are celebrated and used. *Source: how-to-activate-apest-5q-in-your-context.*

### 2. From ST to full fivefold
- **Aim:** Move from over-reliance on Shepherd and Teacher to a culture where Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist are also valued and released.
- **Steps:** Name the gap; invite APE-shaped people into leadership and design; reduce bias toward “safe” ST-only patterns; measure by fivefold marks.

## Tools
- **5Q or APEST assessment:** Profile individuals and teams across the five functions.
- **Fivefold marks checklist:** Score the church or team on apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching expression.
