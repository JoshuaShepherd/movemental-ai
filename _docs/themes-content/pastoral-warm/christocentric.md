# Christ at the Center

## Short description

Christ-centered faith and discipleship—the confession “Jesus Is Lord” as the heart of mDNA and the lens through which we see mission, church, and life.

## Long description

“Jesus Is Lord” isn’t a slogan; it’s the center from which everything else in movement DNA radiates. When persecution or crisis strips everything else away, this is what remains—and it’s enough. This theme explores Christ at the center: how Christology shapes missiology and ecclesiology, how to “reJesus” the church by recalibrating around the person of Jesus, and why the simplest confession is also the most revolutionary. From *ReJesus* to *Reframation* and the first element of mDNA, you’ll find resources that keep Jesus central in your theology, your community, and your mission.
