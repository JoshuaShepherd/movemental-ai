# Case studies & stories — Christ at the Center

## 1. Early church under Caesar
- **Type:** Historical / biblical.
- **Summary:** “Jesus is Lord” was a direct political challenge to “Caesar is Lord.” Persecution followed; the church refused to compromise the center. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4.*

## 2. Chinese underground church
- **Type:** Historical.
- **Summary:** Under persecution, the church distilled to essence—Jesus Is Lord. No buildings, no central org; from ~2M to ~120M in seventy years. *Source: The Forgotten Ways; concept-definition.*

## 3. ReJesus in practice
- **Type:** Contemporary.
- **Summary:** Churches that intentionally recalibrate around the person of Jesus (teaching, mission, structures). Use local or anonymized examples. *Source: ReJesus.*
