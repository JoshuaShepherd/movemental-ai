# Core concept — Christ at the Center

**Target length:** 500–1000 words.

“Jesus Is Lord” is not one element among six in movement DNA; it is the **center from which all other elements radiate**. When persecution or crisis strips everything else away, this confession is what remains—and it is enough. The early church and the Chinese underground church both discovered that when access to buildings, clergy, and resources was removed, the message distilled to Jesus: his person, his story, his claim on our lives. The Chinese church grew from roughly 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under severe persecution. They had no external resources. They had the essence—the core truth that all else depends upon.

The confession “Jesus Is Lord” is rooted in the Shema (“Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one”) and the New Testament’s christocentric monotheism: the rule associated with the Father is now revealed in the Son. God has placed all things under Christ’s feet and appointed him head over everything for the church (Ephesians 1:20–23). This confession eliminates all competing claims to ultimate authority—whether Caesar, consumerism, nationalism, or any other false god. It is inherently political, inherently revolutionary, and inherently missional. The lordship of Jesus is not only a theological proposition; it is a reality to be lived. It demands total allegiance and reshapes every dimension of life.

**Christology determines missiology determines ecclesiology.** We cannot get the church right unless we first get Jesus right; we cannot get mission right unless it flows from who Jesus is and what he came to do. The call to “reJesus” the church—in *ReJesus* and throughout the corpus—is to recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus rather than around programs, strategies, or institutional forms. Formation is formation into his image; mission is participation in his mission; community is life under his lordship.

For pastoral-warm audiences, Christ at the Center means: (1) Keeping “Jesus Is Lord” as the confessed and lived center of teaching, worship, and mission. (2) Distilling to essence—simple enough to transfer, profound enough to transform. (3) Resisting every competing claim to ultimate loyalty. (4) Letting Christology shape how we do church and mission.
