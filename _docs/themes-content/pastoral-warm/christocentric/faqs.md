# Comprehensive Q&A — Christ at the Center

## Category: Jesus Is Lord

### Why is “Jesus Is Lord” the first element of mDNA?
It is the center that gives meaning to all other elements. When persecution strips everything away, this confession remains. Christology determines missiology and ecclesiology. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4; concept-definition-jesus-is-lord-mdna.*

### What does “Jesus Is Lord” mean in practice?
Total allegiance; no competing ultimate claims (Caesar, consumerism, nationalism). All of life under his lordship—no sacred/secular split. Lived reality, not only belief. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4.*

### How does this connect to the Shema?
The Shema (“the Lord is one”) is reinformed in the NT around Christ. Christocentric monotheism: we come to God through Jesus; allegiance is to him. *Source: concept-definition-jesus-is-lord-mdna.*

## Category: ReJesus and formation

### What does it mean to “reJesus” the church?
Recalibrate everything around the person of Jesus—not programs, strategies, or institutional forms. Get Jesus right first; then mission and church can align. *Source: ReJesus.*

### How does Christ at the center shape mission and discipleship?
Mission flows from who Jesus is and what he came to do. Discipleship is formation into his image. You cannot have faithful mission or discipleship without Christ at the center. *Source: ReJesus; Disciplism.*

### Why “distill to essence”?
Movements under pressure (early church, Chinese church) distilled to a message simple enough to transfer and profound enough to transform. The essence is Jesus Is Lord. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4.*

## Category: Competing claims

### What competing claims does “Jesus Is Lord” challenge?
Caesar (political), consumerism (cultural), nationalism (tribal), and any other absolute claim. The confession is inherently political and revolutionary. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4.*
