# Practical guides — Christ at the Center

## Roadmaps

### 1. Centering on Jesus Is Lord
- **Step 1:** Audit teaching, worship, and decisions: Is Jesus the stated and lived center?
- **Step 2:** Name competing claims (consumerism, tradition, comfort) and intentionally subordinate them to Christ.
- **Step 3:** Distill your message: Can you articulate the essence in a few sentences? Is it Jesus-centered?
- **Step 4:** Align mission and ecclesiology with Christology (who is Jesus, what did he come to do, what does that mean for us?). *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 4; ReJesus.*

### 2. ReJesus process
- **Aim:** Recalibrate church or team around the person of Jesus.
- **Steps:** Study Jesus in the Gospels; name where we’ve drifted to programs or forms; realign identity, mission, and practice with his person and mission. *Source: ReJesus.*

## Tools
- **Center audit:** Where does our church/team look to for ultimate authority (explicitly or implicitly)? Is it Jesus?
- **Essence statement:** One paragraph that distills our message; it should be Christ-centered and reproducible.
