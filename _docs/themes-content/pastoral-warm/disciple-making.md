# Disciple Making

## Short description

Making disciples who make disciples: frameworks and practices that put formation at the center, so evangelism and mission flow from a life that looks like Jesus.

## Long description

Jesus didn’t primarily build programs or institutions—he made disciples. That commission hasn’t changed. This theme focuses on disciple-making as the church’s essential practice: Jesus-shaped formation, the inseparability of mission and discipleship, and the call to “begin with the end in mind.” Here you’ll find a reframing of evangelism within discipleship (disciplism), practical wisdom from *Untamed* and *Disciplism*, and resources to help you and your community become people who multiply disciples, not just decisions.
