# Core concept — Disciple Making

**Target length:** 500–1000 words.

Jesus did not primarily build programs or institutions—he made disciples. The church’s primary commission is the same: make disciples of all nations. Disciple-making is not one program among many; it is the non-negotiable core practice on which every significant missional movement in history has been built. When movements lose this focus, they decline. When churches prioritize discipleship, they discover the key to multiplication, transformation, and lasting impact.

A critical insight developed in *Disciplism* is that **discipleship is evangelism’s true context, not the other way around**. The church growth movement reversed the order: event-based proclamation and altar calls took precedence over the long-term, relational process of disciple-making. The result has been a Christianity that makes converts but not disciples—and as Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned, Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ. The corrective is “begin with the end in mind”: if the end goal is making disciples, then everything—evangelism, worship, community, mission—must be oriented toward that goal from the start. Evangelism happens naturally within the disciple-making process; it is not a separate activity.

Authentic discipleship is **Jesus-shaped**: centered on Christ’s person and example, becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. It involves the Shema (loving God with all heart, soul, mind, and strength), the inseparability of mission and discipleship (you cannot have one without the other), and the prophetic call to faithfulness. Discipleship must also be **untamed**—wild, dangerous, and beautiful—as *Untamed* argues: obstacles include false images of God and Jesus, the subverting influence of consumerism, and the need to recover a discipleship that begins even before conversion and continues for life. One cannot consume one’s way into the kingdom; the cross must define our relationship to God from the very beginning.

In mDNA, Disciple-Making is the second element: multiplication through formation. Movements grow in direct proportion to their capacity to make disciples. This theme connects formation (how we are shaped), missional church (the system that includes disciple-making), and Christ at the center (the one we are being formed into). Resources include *Untamed*, *Disciplism*, *The Forgotten Ways* (ch. 5), and courses or articles that put disciple-making at the center of church life.
