# Comprehensive Q&A — Disciple Making

## Category: Disciplism and the Great Commission

### What is disciplism?
Disciplism is the view that discipleship should be the “ism” that shapes our approach—not evangelism as a separate activity, but discipleship as the comprehensive framework. Evangelism happens within the disciple-making process. *Source: Disciplism (book); faq-008.*

### Why put discipleship before evangelism?
The Great Commission says “make disciples”; evangelism is part of that process. When we reverse the order (evangelism first, discipleship optional), we get converts who are not disciples. Begin with the end in mind: the goal is disciples who make disciples.

### What does “begin with the end in mind” mean for disciple-making?
If the end is making disciples, then worship, community, mission, and evangelism all serve that goal. We design for formation and multiplication, not just decisions.

## Category: Jesus-shaped discipleship

### What is Jesus-shaped discipleship?
Discipleship centered on Christ’s person and example—becoming like him in character, passion, and practice. Not just knowing about Jesus but knowing him and being known by him.

### How are mission and discipleship connected?
They are inseparable. You cannot have authentic discipleship without mission, or mission without discipleship. Disciples are sent; mission forms disciples.

### What obstacles does *Untamed* name?
False images of God and Jesus (theology), consumerism and culture (culture), and identity/sexuality/family (personal). Discipleship must be “untamed”—wild and dangerous—to match the Messiah we follow.

### How do I implement disciplism in my church?
Shift understanding: evangelism is part of disciple-making. Orient worship, community, and mission toward making disciples who make disciples. Start with one pathway (e.g. apprenticeship, cohort) and expand. *See faq-017.*

### What is the cross from the beginning?
We cannot consume our way into the kingdom. The cross defines our relationship to God from the start; discipleship can begin before someone is a “convert” and continues for life.
