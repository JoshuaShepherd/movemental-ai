# Practical guides — Disciple Making

## Roadmaps

### 1. Shifting to disciplism
- **Step 1:** Teach the Great Commission as “make disciples” and name evangelism as part of that.
- **Step 2:** Audit current practice: Where do we treat evangelism as separate? Where do we form disciples over time?
- **Step 3:** Design one clear disciple-making pathway (e.g. apprenticeship, cohort, missional community).
- **Step 4:** Align worship, community, and mission with that pathway; measure by disciples, not only decisions.

### 2. Jesus-shaped discipleship pathway
- Include: Scripture, prayer, community, mission, and accountability.
- Center on Christ’s person and example (not just curriculum).
- Integrate mission and discipleship (sent and formed together).

## Tools
- **Disciplism audit:** Where does our church prioritize decisions over disciples? Where do we form people over the long term?
- **Pathway map:** One-page map of how someone moves from newcomer to disciple who makes disciples.

## Checklist
- [ ] We have a shared definition of “disciple” and “disciple-making.”
- [ ] Evangelism is framed inside disciple-making, not the other way around.
- [ ] At least one pathway exists for intentional, long-term formation.
- [ ] We measure and celebrate disciples made, not only decisions or attendance.
