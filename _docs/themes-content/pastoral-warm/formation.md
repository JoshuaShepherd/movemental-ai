# Formation

## Short description

Spiritual and leadership formation for disciples and leaders—including the kind of community that forms when people share a liminal journey: communitas, risk, and the edge where growth happens.

## Long description

Formation is more than curriculum; it’s the slow, faithful work of being shaped into the image of Christ and into the kind of leaders and communities that can carry mission. This theme brings together formation for individuals and for teams, with special attention to communitas—the deep bond that forms when people share a threshold experience, risk, or mission rather than comfort-first community. From books like *Untamed* and *The Faith of Leap* to courses and articles, you’ll find resources that honor the whole person and the journey from information to transformation.
