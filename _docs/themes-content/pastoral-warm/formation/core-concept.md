Formation is more than curriculum or programs; it is the slow, faithful work of being shaped into the image of Christ and into the kind of leaders and communities that can carry mission. At the heart of this theme are two intertwined ideas: **formation as transformation** (formation over information) and **communitas**—the deep bond that forms when people share a liminal journey.

Communitas is not the same as community. Regular community often forms around shared interests, comfort, and similarity. Communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks, “How can this serve me?” Communitas asks, “What can we accomplish together?” Communitas is the togetherness that emerges when people face risk, threshold experiences, or shared ordeal. The term comes from Victor Turner’s work on rites of passage: when people are driven to find one another through common experience of ordeal, humbling, and transition, they develop intense social togetherness. That is communitas.

**Liminality** is the threshold—the in-between space where the old has not yet fully passed and the new has not yet fully arrived. Disorientation, risk, and uncertainty create the conditions for breakthrough. You cannot have communitas without liminality. Formation that only happens in safe, controlled environments often produces compliance, not character. Formation that includes liminality—shared mission, risk, and adventure—produces the kind of leaders and communities that can sustain movement.

In Alan Hirsch’s corpus, this theme is developed in *The Forgotten Ways* (ch. 7, Liminality and Communitas), *The Faith of Leap* (adventure, risk, and communitas in discipleship), *Untamed* (untamed discipleship beyond tame religion), and *The Forgotten Ways Handbook* (practices for communitas). Formation is also one of the six elements of mDNA: when churches prioritize safety and comfort over mission and adventure, they replace communitas with consumeristic community and lose the edge that makes movement possible.

For pastoral-warm audiences, formation means: (1) Choosing formation over information—transformation, not just learning. (2) Creating space for liminality—shared mission, risk, and threshold experiences. (3) Building communitas—community forged in purpose and adventure, not just programs. (4) Drawing on resources like *Untamed*, *The Faith of Leap*, and formation courses that integrate content with practice and community.
