# Comprehensive Q&A — Formation

---

## Category: Communitas and liminality

### What is communitas?
Communitas is the deep bond that forms when people share liminal experiences—threshold, risk, or shared mission. It is not comfort-first community but the togetherness that emerges from shared adventure. *Source: The Forgotten Ways, ch. 7.*

### What is liminality?
Liminality is the threshold experience: the in-between when the old has not fully passed and the new has not fully arrived. Disorientation, risk, and uncertainty create the conditions for breakthrough and for communitas to form.

### How do I create communitas?
Create liminal experiences: shared adventure, risk, and purpose. Engage at the edges of society, take risks for mission, embrace uncertainty, prioritize purpose over comfort, and create environments where people face shared challenge. *See faq-016.*

### What’s the difference between community and communitas?
Community often forms around shared interests and comfort; communitas forms around shared purpose, challenge, and mission. Community asks “How can this serve me?”; communitas asks “What can we accomplish together?” *See thematic-deep-dives 05-community-and-communitas.*

## Category: Formation practice

### Why is formation more than information?
Formation changes who we are—heart, mind, and practice. Information alone does not. Courses and resources that prioritize formation include reflection, practice, and community, not just content.

### How do I build formation into my church or team?
Integrate liminality (shared mission, risk, threshold experiences), reflection (guided questions, journaling), practice (field experiments, habits), and community (cohort, communitas). Avoid formation that is only classroom-style.

### What resources support formation and communitas?
Books: *The Faith of Leap*, *Untamed*, *The Forgotten Ways* (ch. 7). Handbook: practices for communitas. Courses: formation journeys that include cohort and practice.

## Category: Connection to mDNA

### How does formation relate to mDNA?
Communitas (and liminality) is one of the six elements of mDNA. When it’s missing or replaced by comfort-focused community, the system doesn’t activate. Formation that includes communitas strengthens the whole.

### Why is “adventure” important for formation?
*The Faith of Leap* argues that Christianity is an adventure of the spirit or it is not Christianity. Removing adventure domesticates faith. Liminality and communitas require some level of risk and journey.
