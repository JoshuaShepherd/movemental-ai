# Practical guides — Formation

## Roadmaps

### 1. From community to communitas
- **Stage 1:** Name the difference (community vs. communitas) with your team.
- **Stage 2:** Identify one shared purpose or mission that lies beyond “keeping us happy.”
- **Stage 3:** Introduce a shared risk or threshold experience (mission trip, neighborhood initiative, formation cohort with accountability).
- **Stage 4:** Reflect together on what formed in the process; repeat and deepen.

### 2. Building formation into a cohort or course
- Include liminality: shared commitment, accountability, or mission.
- Pair content with practice (field experiments, habits).
- Include reflection (guided questions, journaling).
- Design for communitas (small groups, shared journey, not just individual consumption).

## Tools
- **Communitas habits** (from *The Forgotten Ways Handbook*): transformative vision, positioning at the hub of life, shared endeavors, putting adventure back into the venture.
- **Liminality audit:** Where does our church/team avoid risk or threshold? Where could we introduce shared adventure?

## Checklist: Formation-friendly environment
- [ ] We have a shared purpose beyond maintenance.
- [ ] We create some intentional risk/threshold experiences.
- [ ] Formation includes practice and reflection, not only content.
- [ ] We have spaces for communitas (small groups, cohorts, mission teams).
