# Kingdom Mission

## Short description

Kingdom-centered mission and church planting—how the reign of God shapes where we go, how we multiply, and how we partner with what the Spirit is already doing in the world.

## Long description

Mission that flows from the kingdom of God looks different from mission that flows from institutional growth or brand. This theme connects the “already and not yet” of the kingdom to everyday sentness: planting and multiplying communities, joining God’s mission in the neighborhood and the city, and staying rooted in the confession that Jesus is Lord over every sphere. Here you’ll find resources that help you and your church align with kingdom priorities—multiplication, presence, and faithfulness—rather than simply scaling what you already do.
