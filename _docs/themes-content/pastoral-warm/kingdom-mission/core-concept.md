# Core concept — Kingdom Mission

**Target length:** 500–1000 words.

---

Kingdom mission is mission that flows from the reign of God—the “already and not yet” of the kingdom—rather than from institutional growth, brand, or programs. God is a missionary God; the church exists as a missionary people. Mission is not optional; it is the church’s identity. The missio Dei (the sending of God) precedes and shapes the church’s sending. We go because God has first gone; we join what the Spirit is already doing in the world.

This theme connects to several others: **Missional Church** (the missional-incarnational impulse is one of the six elements of mDNA), **Movement Intelligence** (multiplication and movement quality), **Disciple Making** (mission and discipleship are inseparable), and **Christ at the Center** (the kingdom is the kingdom of Christ). Kingdom-centered mission asks: Where is God at work? How do we multiply communities and disciples rather than only add to one organization? How do we plant the gospel and movements, not only churches as institutions? How do we stay rooted in the confession that Jesus is Lord over every sphere?

Practically, kingdom mission involves: **Going out** (missional impulse—sentness; we go to them). **Going deep** (incarnational impulse—embedding in culture and context). **Multiplication** (reproduction at every level—disciples, communities, leaders). **Partnership** (joining the Spirit’s work; prevenient grace). **Faithfulness** (aligning with kingdom priorities: justice, mercy, witness, love). Resources that support this theme include *The Forgotten Ways* (ch. 6, Missional-Incarnational Impulse), *Right Here, Right Now*, *Reframation* (romancing the city), and courses on mission and church planting. When the template or app supports full portal sections, expand with FAQs, case studies (e.g. early church, Celtic mission, contemporary multiplication), and practical guides for kingdom-centered planting and sentness.
