# Comprehensive Q&A — Kingdom Mission

## Category: Kingdom and mission

### What is kingdom mission?
Mission that flows from the reign of God (the kingdom) and the missio Dei—God’s sending—rather than from institutional growth or programs. It is sentness, multiplication, and partnership with what the Spirit is doing.

### What is the missio Dei?
The “sending of God”—God’s initiative to restore and heal creation. The church’s mission derives from God’s mission; we are sent because God has first gone. *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 6.*

### How does kingdom mission differ from church growth?
Church growth can be attractional (come to us) and additive (add to one organization). Kingdom mission is missional (go to them), multiplicative (reproduce disciples and communities), and aligned with kingdom priorities (justice, mercy, witness). *See faq-009.*

### How do we “go out and go deep”?
**Go out:** Sentness; missional impulse; we go to them. **Go deep:** Incarnational impulse; embed in culture and context (presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, passion, proclamation). *Source: The Forgotten Ways ch. 6; thematic-deep-dives 06-mission-and-incarnation.*

### How do we multiply rather than only add?
Reproduce at every level: disciples who make disciples, communities that plant communities, leaders who develop leaders. Organic systems and disciple-making are key. *Source: Movement Intelligence; thematic-deep-dives 12-multiplication-and-reproduction.*

### How do we partner with what the Spirit is already doing?
Pay attention (like Moses at the burning bush); listen to culture and context; practice “interpathy” and “romancing the city” (*Reframation*). Prevenient grace means God is already at work; we join, we don’t only initiate. *Source: Reframation ch. 10.*
