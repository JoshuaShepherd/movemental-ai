# Practical guides — Kingdom Mission

## Roadmaps

### 1. From attractional to missional
- **Step 1:** Name the default (come to us vs. go to them).
- **Step 2:** Identify one context or neighborhood where you will “go” and “go deep.”
- **Step 3:** Develop practices of presence, listening, and partnership (see six P’s or four movements in content-research).
- **Step 4:** Measure sentness and multiplication, not only attendance.

### 2. Multiplication pathway
- **Aim:** Reproduce disciples, communities, and leaders.
- **Steps:** Design for reproduction (simple, reproducible patterns); train multipliers; release rather than retain; celebrate multiplication. *Source: Movement Intelligence; organic systems.*

## Tools
- **Sentness audit:** Where does our church “go”? Where do we only “invite”?
- **Multiplication map:** Where are we reproducing disciples, communities, or leaders?

## Checklist
- [ ] We have a shared understanding of “kingdom mission” and “sentness.”
- [ ] We go to them (missional) and go deep (incarnational) in at least one context.
- [ ] We measure and celebrate multiplication, not only addition.
- [ ] We partner with what the Spirit is doing (listening, discernment).
