# Missional Church

## Short description

Foundations and practices for missional ecclesiology and apostolic movement—the six-element genetic code (mDNA) that has driven every significant Jesus movement in history, and how to recover it in your context.

## Long description

The missional church isn’t a model to copy; it’s a way of being the people of God that flows from the mission of God. At the heart of this theme is mDNA—Movement DNA—the six elements that together form Apostolic Genius: Jesus Is Lord, disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST culture, organic systems, and communitas. When these elements are present and working together, something powerful awakens. Here you’ll find resources to understand that system, assess where you are, and take practical steps toward recovering the forgotten ways in your own community.
