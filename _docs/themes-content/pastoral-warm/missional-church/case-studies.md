## 1. The early church (AD 100–310)
- **Type:** Historical.
- **Period:** First three centuries.
- **Summary:** A tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire. Estimates: as few as 25,000 Christians in AD 100 to up to 20 million by AD 310. No buildings, no professional clergy, no mass media—yet exponential growth. All six elements of mDNA were present: Jesus Is Lord at the center, disciple-making as core practice, missional-incarnational impulse, APEST culture, organic networks, and communitas formed in persecution and mission.
- **Key points:** Simplicity of message (“Jesus is Lord”); multiplication through discipleship; sentness; distributed ministry; reproducible patterns; community forged in risk.

## 2. The Chinese underground church (20th century)
- **Type:** Historical / contemporary.
- **Summary:** From roughly 2 million to 120 million in seventy years under severe persecution. No buildings, no central organization, no mass meetings. The church distilled to essence—Jesus Is Lord—and the six elements of mDNA enabled movement even when every external resource was removed. Demonstrates that Apostolic Genius is latent and can be reactivated under the most difficult conditions.
- **Key points:** Essence under pressure; all six elements present; multiplication through discipleship and organic systems; communitas in crisis.

## 3. The Methodist movement (Wesley)
- **Type:** Historical.
- **Period:** 18th century.
- **Summary:** During Wesley’s lifetime, one in thirty English men and women became Methodists. The movement had all six elements: Jesus Is Lord, rigorous disciple-making (class meetings, bands), missional-incarnational engagement, APEST culture (Wesley apostolic; all functions activated), organic systems (societies, circuits, classes), and communitas through shared discipline and mission.
- **Key points:** Organic structures (class meetings); disciple-making as engine; movemental spread; communitas through shared practice.
- **Source:** *The Forgotten Ways*; movement dynamics case studies.
