## Jesus Is Lord (Christ at the center)
The first and foundational element of mDNA. The confession “Jesus Is Lord” gives meaning to all other elements; Christology determines missiology and ecclesiology. Without this center, the other five elements lack coherence. *Theme slug: christocentric.*

## Disciple-Making
The essential practice of mDNA: multiplication through formation. Movements grow in proportion to their capacity to make disciples. Evangelism belongs inside discipleship, not the other way around. *Theme slug: disciple-making.*

## Missional-Incarnational Impulse
Going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational). The twin dynamic that sends the church into the world and embeds the gospel in culture. Connects to “sentness” and incarnational mission. *Content-research: missional-incarnational-impulse.*

## APEST & Fivefold Ministry
The fivefold intelligence (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher) that creates the ministry environment for maturity and mission. When APEST is active, the body moves toward the “fullness of Christ.” *Theme slug: apest.*

## Organic Systems
Structures that enable movement: self-organizing, adaptive, reproducible, networked. The opposite of centralized, mechanical organization. Connects to “starfish vs. spider” and multiplication. *Content-research: organic-systems.*

## Liminality & Communitas
The sixth element: community forged in shared threshold, risk, or mission. Communitas is not comfort-first community but the bond that forms when people share an adventure. *Theme slug: formation (Communitas).*

## The Forgotten Ways (book/portal)
The book and framework that named Apostolic Genius and the six elements. “Forgotten ways” = the latent patterns we recover, not invent. *Portal: forgotten-ways.*

## Movement Intelligence (mQ)
Movement quality and multiplication vs. institutional growth. mDNA activation leads to movemental outcomes; Movement Intelligence describes what those outcomes look like and how to assess them. *Portal: movement-intelligence.*

## Metanoia / Transformation
Paradigm shift and organizational transformation. Activating mDNA often requires metanoia—a change of mind and culture—so the church can operate as movement rather than institution. *Portal: metanoia.*

## Reframation
Re-enchanting our vision of God, church, and mission. Reframation supports mDNA by addressing the “crisis of interpretation” and helping people see the church and mission anew. *Portal: reframation.*
