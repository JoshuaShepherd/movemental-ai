## 1. Jesus Is Lord: The heart of mDNA
- **Slug:** `01-jesus-is-lord-christocentrism` (or theme christocentric)
- **Excerpt:** The confession “Jesus Is Lord” is not one element among six; it is the center from which all others radiate. When persecution forces movements to distill their message, what remains is this simple yet profound claim. This deep dive explores christocentric monotheism, the Shema, and why getting Jesus right is the first step to getting church and mission right.

## 2. Discipleship and disciple-making
- **Slug:** `02-discipleship-and-disciple-making`
- **Excerpt:** Movements grow in direct proportion to their capacity to make disciples. This piece explores Jesus-shaped discipleship, disciplism (evangelism within discipleship), and why disciple-making is the non-negotiable core practice of mDNA.

## 3. Community and communitas
- **Slug:** `05-community-and-communitas`
- **Excerpt:** Communitas is the deep bond that forms when people share a liminal experience—risk, mission, or threshold. Not comfort-first community but the togetherness that emerges from shared adventure. This deep dive contrasts community and communitas and shows how liminality and communitas function as one element of mDNA.

## 4. mDNA as a living system: The weakest element limits the whole
- **Slug:** `mdna-living-system-limiting-factor`
- **Excerpt:** mDNA is systemic: each element is necessary but not sufficient. This piece explains how the six elements interact, why the “shortest stave” limits the barrel, and how to identify and strengthen your limiting factor without neglecting the others.
- **Source:** framework-mDNA-system; faq-021, faq-024.
