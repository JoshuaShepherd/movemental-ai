## Category: What is mDNA and Apostolic Genius?

### What is the missional church?
The missional church is the people of God living from the mission of God—sent into the world as Jesus was sent, rather than centering on attractional gatherings. It is expressed through the six elements of Movement DNA (mDNA) and the emergence of Apostolic Genius when those elements work together.

### What is Movement DNA (mDNA)?
Movement DNA (mDNA) is the six-element genetic code that has driven every significant Jesus movement in history: Jesus Is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas. Like biological DNA, mDNA is present in every genuine expression of church, carries the information needed to reproduce the whole, and can be reactivated when dormant. *Source: The Forgotten Ways, ch. 3.*

### What is Apostolic Genius?
Apostolic Genius is the life that emerges when all six elements of mDNA are present and functioning together—a paradigmatic shift from institutional to movemental operation. It is not a program but an emergent system; it is latent in the church and can be recovered. *Source: The Forgotten Ways, Introduction and ch. 3.*

### How do the six elements work together?
Each element is necessary but not sufficient. All six must be present and active for the system to activate. The weakest element limits the whole (like the shortest stave of a barrel). You cannot pick and choose; recovery and activation require attention to all six.

## Category: Recovery and activation

### How do I activate movement DNA in my church?
Begin with honest assessment: which elements are present, missing, or suppressed? Start with Jesus Is Lord as the center, prioritize disciple-making, develop missional-incarnational practices, activate APEST culture, build organic systems, and create space for liminality and communitas. Recovery is the goal, not importing a new program. *See content-research faq-010, faq-011.*

### What happens when mDNA elements are missing?
The system does not activate. Churches can do many good things and still not experience movement, because mDNA is systemic. Identifying the “limiting factor”—the weakest element—is the first step toward strengthening the whole. *See faq-021.*

### How do I know if mDNA is activating?
Look for movement indicators: exponential rather than linear growth, reproduction at multiple levels, adaptive capacity, network structures, and a culture that values sentness, discipleship, fivefold ministry, organic structures, and communitas. Use an mDNA assessment tool to map presence and health of each element. *See faq-024.*

### What is the difference between missional and attractional?
Missional means the church is sent into the world (go to them); attractional means the church expects people to come to its gatherings and programs. mDNA’s missional-incarnational impulse is “go out and go deep,” not “come and join.” *See faq-009.*

## Category: Core concepts

### Why is “Jesus Is Lord” the first element?
Jesus Is Lord is the central confession that gives meaning to all other elements. When persecution strips everything else away, this is what remains. Christology determines missiology and ecclesiology; we cannot get the church or mission right without getting Jesus right first.

### What are organic systems?
Structures that behave like living organisms rather than machines: self-organizing, adaptive, reproducible, fractal, and networked. They enable multiplication and spread (e.g. starfish vs. spider). *See framework-organic-systems.*

### What is communitas?
The deep bond that forms when people share liminal (threshold) experiences—risk, mission, or crisis. It is not comfort-first community but the togetherness that emerges from shared adventure. It is one of the six elements of mDNA. *See thematic-deep-dives 05-community-and-communitas.*

## Category: Implementation

### How do I embed mDNA in my church?
Use a roadmap: (1) Assess current state of all six elements. (2) Start with Jesus Is Lord and disciple-making. (3) Introduce missional-incarnational practices and APEST awareness. (4) Shift structures toward organic, reproducible patterns. (5) Create intentional liminal experiences. Work systemically, not programmatically. *See practical-guides how-to-embed-mdna.*

### What if leaders don’t support this?
Invite rather than impose. Share stories and frameworks (e.g. early church, Chinese church). Start with one element (often disciple-making or Jesus Is Lord) and let the system speak. *See faq-027.*

### What if my church is very small or very large?
mDNA applies at every scale. Small churches often have latent communitas and simplicity; large churches can use frameworks like *On the Verge* to move toward movemental thinking. Context shapes which element to emphasize first, but all six remain necessary. *See faq-023.*
