Foundations and practices for apostolic movement

## Description
Foundations and practices for missional ecclesiology and apostolic movement—the six-element genetic code (mDNA) that has driven every significant Jesus movement in history, and how to recover it in your context.

## Hero quote
> How do we account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in just two centuries? … What generative system undergirds these transformative movements, and more importantly, does it still lie dormant within the church today?
