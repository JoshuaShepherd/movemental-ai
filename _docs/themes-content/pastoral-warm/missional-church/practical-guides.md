# Practical guides — Missional Church

Roadmaps, tools, and checklists for the Practical Guides section.

## Roadmaps (1–3)

### 1. Introducing mDNA in your context
- **Stage 1 — Assess:** Map the six elements: which are present, missing, or suppressed? Use an mDNA assessment (see Tools).
- **Stage 2 — Center:** Ensure Jesus Is Lord is the real center (teaching, worship, decisions). Then strengthen disciple-making as the core practice.
- **Stage 3 — Extend:** Develop missional-incarnational practices (go out, go deep); activate APEST awareness across the body.
- **Stage 4 — Structure:** Move toward organic, reproducible patterns (simple rules, common language, distributed leadership).
- **Stage 5 — Community:** Create intentional liminal experiences (shared mission, risk, threshold) that foster communitas.

### 2. Recovering the forgotten ways
- **Aim:** Reactivate latent mDNA rather than add new programs.
- **Steps:** (1) Name the forgotten ways from Scripture and history. (2) Diagnose which elements are dormant in your context. (3) Choose one limiting factor to address first. (4) Embed that element in practice and culture. (5) Re-assess and strengthen the next. Repeat.

### 3. Assessing your mDNA
- **Purpose:** Diagnostic, not verdict. Identifies strengths and the “limiting factor.”
- **Steps:** (1) Score each of the six elements (e.g. 1–5) with honesty. (2) Note which element is weakest. (3) Reflect on what would change if that element were strengthened. (4) Revisit at mid-point and end of a formation cycle (e.g. 8–12 weeks).

## Tools
- **mDNA assessment:** Use a simple questionnaire or rubric covering all six elements (see content-research evals/rubrics if available). Output: profile + limiting factor.
- **Element checklist:** One-page checklist per element (e.g. “Jesus Is Lord: Is he the stated and lived center of our teaching, mission, and structures?”). Use in teams or leadership.

## Checklists (1–2)

### mDNA health checklist (short)
- [ ] Jesus Is Lord is the confessed and lived center.
- [ ] Disciple-making is the primary commission we measure and resource.
- [ ] We go out (missional) and go deep (incarnational), not only attract.
- [ ] All five APEST functions are valued and visible (not only Shepherd/Teacher).
- [ ] Our structures are simple, reproducible, and networked (organic).
- [ ] We create space for liminality and communitas (shared risk, mission, threshold).

### Pre-launch checklist for an mDNA-focused cohort or course
- [ ] Assessment available for Week 0.
- [ ] All six elements covered in content and practice.
- [ ] Limiting factor identified and personalized pathway offered.
- [ ] Field experiments or practices per element.
- [ ] Cohort/community component (communitas) built in.
