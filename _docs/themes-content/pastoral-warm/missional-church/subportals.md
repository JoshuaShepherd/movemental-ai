# Subportals — Missional Church (mDNA hub)

The Missional Church theme functions as a hub for the six elements of mDNA. Each element can be treated as a subportal when the UI supports it.

| # | Slug | Title | Short description |
|---|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | jesus-is-lord | Jesus Is Lord | The central confession that gives meaning to all other elements—Christ at the center. |
| 2 | disciple-making | Disciple-Making | Multiplication through formation; making disciples who make disciples. |
| 3 | missional-incarnational | Missional-Incarnational Impulse | Going out (missional) and going deep (incarnational) into culture. |
| 4 | apest | APEST & Fivefold Ministry | Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—fivefold intelligence in the body. |
| 5 | organic-systems | Organic Systems | Movemental structures: simple, reproducible, networked, adaptive. |
| 6 | liminality-communitas | Liminality & Communitas | Threshold community forged in shared mission and risk. |

When rendering, link each to theme-detail or portal with `?theme=` or `/portals/` equivalent.
