# Pastoral-Warm Themes Index

Quick reference for all themes. **Source of truth** for copy is each theme’s `{slug}.md` file; this index is for scanning and linking.

| Slug | Title | Short description (card/lead) |
|------|--------|-------------------------------|
| [missional-church](./missional-church.md) | Missional Church | Foundations and practices for missional ecclesiology and apostolic movement—the six-element genetic code (mDNA) that has driven every significant Jesus movement in history, and how to recover it in your context. |
| [formation](./formation.md) | Formation | Spiritual and leadership formation for disciples and leaders—including the kind of community that forms when people share a liminal journey: communitas, risk, and the edge where growth happens. |
| [disciple-making](./disciple-making.md) | Disciple Making | Making disciples who make disciples: frameworks and practices that put formation at the center, so evangelism and mission flow from a life that looks like Jesus. |
| [apest](./apest.md) | APEST | Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—the fivefold ministry Christ gave for the maturity and mission of his body. Explore 5Q and how to activate all five forms of intelligence in your community. |
| [kingdom-mission](./kingdom-mission.md) | Kingdom Mission | Kingdom-centered mission and church planting—how the reign of God shapes where we go, how we multiply, and how we partner with what the Spirit is already doing in the world. |
| [christocentric](./christocentric.md) | Christ at the Center | Christ-centered faith and discipleship—the confession “Jesus Is Lord” as the heart of mDNA and the lens through which we see mission, church, and life. |
