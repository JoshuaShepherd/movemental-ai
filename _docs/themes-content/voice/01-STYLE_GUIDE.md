## Sentence Structure Patterns

### 1. Indicative-Imperative Arc

**Pattern**: Statement of truth (indicative) → Call to action (imperative)

**Example**:
> "Jesus is Lord is not a slogan for the margins; it is the gravitational center that reshapes our people into a movement. When we receive that indicative, we are compelled toward a communal imperative—practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood."

**Structure**:
- Indicative: "Jesus is Lord is..." (what is true)
- Imperative: "practice the way..." (what we must do)
- Connector: "When we receive... we are compelled"

**Frequency**: Very common - appears in most chapters

### 2. Three-Part Enumeration

**Pattern**: Lists of three elements, often building in intensity

**Example**:
> "The apostolic genius consists of six key elements: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and communitas."

**Variations**:
- "First... Second... Third..."
- "One... Another... And finally..."
- Simple enumeration with colons

**Frequency**: Common in explanatory passages

### 3. Question-Answer Pattern

**Pattern**: Rhetorical question followed by answer

**Example**:
> "What did the early church see as its mission? What did they believe Christ had birthed the church for? How did they understand John 20:21, when Jesus said to his disciples, 'As the Father has sent me, I am sending you'? In short, what did it mean for the early church to join Jesus on his mission?"

**Frequency**: Common in exploratory sections

### 4. Metaphorical Definition

**Pattern**: "X is like Y" or "Imagine X as Y"

**Example**:
> "Imagine the church as a window flung open to the Kingdom wind. When we polish that window through communal holiness, neighbors glimpse the radiant story of Jesus."

**Frequency**: Very common - appears in most chapters

---

## Paragraph Organization

### 1. Opening Hook Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Engaging quote or question
2. Context-setting sentence
3. Thesis or main point

**Example**:
> "If you want to build a ship, don't summon people to buy wood, prepare tools, distribute jobs, and organize the work, rather teach people the yearning for the wide, boundless ocean."
> 
> —Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
>
> My friend Alan Hirsch wants us to remember the essential mission of the church. He wants us to long for God's kingdom in the way that the early church did.

### 2. Narrative-Concept Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Story or example
2. Transition ("This story illustrates...")
3. Conceptual explanation
4. Application

**Example**:
> "Without doubt my most formative experience of local ministry was my involvement in a remarkable inner-city church called South Melbourne Restoration Community... [story continues]
>
> What is quite remarkable is that here, latent in this spontaneous, chaotic, and unchurched group of people, lay the seeds of an agile, evolving, missional movement, long before we even knew that such concepts existed."

### 3. Framework-Application Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Present framework or concept
2. Explain components
3. Show application
4. Connect to practice

**Example**:
> "The missional DNA we steward is fractal: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas. Each element repeats at every scale so the whole movement stays alive.
>
> Consider disciple making. At the individual level, we are called to become like Jesus. At the community level, we are called to form others into the image of Christ. At the movement level, we are called to create cultures where disciple making becomes the default mode of operation."

---

## Argument Flow

### 1. Problem-Solution Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Identify problem
2. Explain why it matters
3. Present solution
4. Show how solution addresses problem

**Example**:
> "One of the most compelling indicators that Western Christendom is concluding—or rapidly disintegrating—is the proliferation of broad and diverse initiatives to plant untraditional, post-denominational congregations... [problem]
>
> The apostolic genius helps us understand how to maintain the movement dynamic even as we grow and mature. It's about creating systems that support rather than suppress the apostolic impulse. [solution]"

### 2. Historical-Contemporary Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Historical example or pattern
2. Contemporary application
3. Lessons learned
4. Call to action

**Example**:
> "In the study of the history of missions, one can even be formulaic about asserting that great missionary movements seem to always begin at the fringes of the church, among the poor and the marginalized, and seldom at the center... [historical]
>
> This says a whole lot about God and the gospel, and the church will do well to heed it... [contemporary application]"

### 3. Theological-Practical Pattern

**Structure**:
1. Theological foundation
2. Biblical grounding
3. Practical implications
4. Action steps

**Example**:
> "Ephesians 4 is the pivotal section where Paul moves from theology to praxis... [theological]
>

## Opening Patterns

## Style Guardrails

### Prohibited Patterns: Antithesis and Contrast Structures

**CRITICAL RULE**: Write without antithesis or contrast structures. Avoid "not...but..." and similar patterns. Do not affirm one idea by negating another. Use only constructive, forward-moving, integrative phrasing.

**Prohibited Patterns**:
- ❌ "X is not Y, but Z" 
- ❌ "Not A, but B"
- ❌ "This is not about X, but about Y"
- ❌ Any structure that negates one idea to affirm another
- ❌ Contrastive constructions that set ideas in opposition

**Required Approach**:
- ✅ Use direct, affirmative statements
- ✅ Present ideas constructively and integratively
- ✅ Build forward-moving arguments
- ✅ Connect ideas without negating alternatives
- ✅ Use additive language ("and", "also", "furthermore") and avoid contrastive language ("not...but", "rather than", "instead of")

**Examples of Prohibited Patterns**:
- ❌ "The church is not a building, but a people"
- ❌ "This is not about programs, but about relationships"
- ❌ "We are called not to attract, but to send"

**Examples of Correct Patterns**:
- ✅ "The church is a people sent into the world"
- ✅ "This is about relationships that form disciples"
- ✅ "We are called to send people into their neighborhoods"

**For Evals and Voice Prompts**: This guardrail must be checked in all voice/style evaluations. Any output containing antithesis or contrast structures should be flagged as non-compliant.

## Writing Checklist

When writing in Alan's voice, check:

- [ ] Does it start with a hook (quote, question, or story)?
- [ ] Is there a clear indicative-imperative arc?
- [ ] Are metaphors and imagery present?
- [ ] Is "Jesus is Lord" or equivalent Christocentric language present?
- [ ] Is there movement/apostolic language?
- [ ] Is there pastoral warmth (communal, relational language)?
- [ ] Are transitions clear ("So", "This", "When we")?
- [ ] Does it connect theology to practice?
- [ ] Is the tone invitational ("we") not prescriptive ("you must")?
- [ ] Does it end with vision, challenge, or reflection?
- [ ] **Does it avoid antithesis/contrast structures ("not...but..." patterns)?**

## Examples by Pattern

### Example 1: Indicative-Imperative Arc
> "Jesus is Lord is not a slogan for the margins; it is the gravitational center that reshapes our people into a movement. When we receive that indicative, we are compelled toward a communal imperative—practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood."

### Example 2: Metaphorical Definition
> "Imagine the church as a window flung open to the Kingdom wind. When we polish that window through communal holiness, neighbors glimpse the radiant story of Jesus and are invited into the pilgrimage."

### Example 3: Framework-Application
> "The missional DNA we steward is fractal: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas. Each element repeats at every scale so the whole movement stays alive."

### Example 4: Problem-Solution
> "One of the greatest challenges facing the church today is the tendency toward institutionalization. Over time, movements become institutions, and institutions tend to focus on maintenance rather than mission. The apostolic genius helps us understand how to maintain the movement dynamic even as we grow and mature."
