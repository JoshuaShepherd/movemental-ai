## Overview

The voice and style system measures five dimensions of Alan Hirsch's writing voice. Each metric is scored 0.0-1.0, and this guide shows you what those scores look like in actual writing.

---

## 1. Prophetic Intensity (Target: 0.5-0.8)

### What It Measures
Apostolic urgency, transformational language, movement-oriented vocabulary

### Score Ranges

#### 0.0-0.3 (Too Low)
**What it looks like**: Passive, descriptive, lacks urgency
**Example**:
> "The church has various programs that can be helpful. Some people find these programs useful for their spiritual growth."

**Why it's low**: No movement language, no urgency, purely descriptive

#### 0.4-0.6 (Good Range)
**What it looks like**: Balanced urgency with pastoral care
**Example**:
> "Jesus is Lord is not a slogan for the margins; it is the gravitational center that reshapes our people into a movement. When we receive that indicative, we are compelled toward a communal imperative—practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood."

**Why it's good**: Movement language ("movement", "compelled"), transformational ("reshapes"), but balanced

#### 0.7-0.9 (Strong, May Need Balance)
**What it looks like**: High urgency, strong transformational language
**Example**:
> "We must multiply missional communities across every neighborhood. The apostolic mandate demands radical decentralization. Transform the church or watch it die."

**Why it's high**: Multiple urgent terms ("must", "demands", "radical", "transform", "die")

#### 0.9-1.0 (Too High - Lacks Balance)
**What it looks like**: Overly aggressive, lacks pastoral warmth
**Example**:
> "The institutional church is dead. Burn it down. Start over. Revolution now. No compromise."

**Why it's too high**: All urgency, no balance, no pastoral care

### Language Patterns That Increase Score

**High-Impact Terms** (use 2-4 per 100 words):
- `apostolic`, `missional`, `movement`, `multiply`, `decentralize`
- `transform`, `radical`, `prophetic`, `calling`, `sent`
- `commission`, `mandate`, `urgency`, `breakthrough`, `catalyst`

**Sentence Patterns**:
- "We must..." (imperative)
- "The movement requires..." (necessity)
- "This compels us to..." (urgency)
- "We are called to..." (commission)

### How to Adjust

**To Increase**:
- Add movement-oriented vocabulary
- Use imperative language ("must", "need", "require")
- Include transformational language ("reshape", "transform", "renew")

**To Decrease**:
- Add more descriptive language
- Include questions or reflections
- Balance with pastoral warmth terms

## 2. Pastoral Warmth (Target: ≥0.5)

### What It Measures
Relational, communal language, care-oriented vocabulary

### Score Ranges

#### 0.0-0.3 (Too Low)
**What it looks like**: Cold, academic, detached
**Example**:
> "Ecclesiological paradigms undergo punctuated equilibrium when apostolic environments collapse into clericalism."

**Why it's low**: Academic jargon, no relational language, no warmth

#### 0.4-0.6 (Good Range)
**What it looks like**: Warm, relational, inviting
**Example**:
> "Imagine the church as a window flung open to the Kingdom wind. When we polish that window through communal holiness, neighbors glimpse the radiant story of Jesus and are invited into the pilgrimage."

**Why it's good**: Relational language ("we", "neighbors", "invited"), communal ("communal"), warm imagery

#### 0.7-1.0 (Very Warm)
**What it looks like**: Highly relational, deeply caring
**Example**:
> "Together we journey, walking alongside one another in this beautiful adventure of faith. We care for each other, nurture each other, and support each other as family."

**Why it's high**: Multiple relational terms ("together", "alongside", "care", "nurture", "support", "family")

### Language Patterns That Increase Score

**High-Impact Terms** (use 2-4 per 100 words):
- `together`, `community`, `formation`, `journey`, `shepherd`
- `care`, `belonging`, `family`, `brothers`, `sisters`, `fellowship`
- `nurture`, `encouragement`, `support`, `compassion`

**Sentence Patterns**:
- "We journey together..." (communal)
- "As a community, we..." (relational)
- "Let us care for..." (pastoral)
- "We belong to..." (belonging)

### How to Adjust

**To Increase**:
- Add relational pronouns ("we", "us", "together")
- Include care-oriented vocabulary
- Use communal language
- Add warmth through imagery

**To Decrease**:
- Use more third-person language
- Remove relational terms
- Make language more formal/academic

## 3. Christocentric Anchoring (Target: ≥0.7)

### What It Measures
Gospel-centeredness, Christ-focused language, biblical grounding

### Score Ranges

#### 0.0-0.4 (Too Low - Missing Center)
**What it looks like**: Generic spirituality, no explicit Christ reference
**Example**:
> "Organizations need better structures. Leadership requires vision. Communities should collaborate more effectively."

**Why it's low**: No mention of Jesus, Christ, gospel, Kingdom, or biblical concepts

#### 0.5-0.7 (Good Range)
**What it looks like**: Christ-centered but not overwhelming
**Example**:
> "The missional DNA we steward is fractal: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas."

**Why it's good**: Explicit "Jesus is Lord", gospel concepts ("disciple making", "missional-incarnational"), Kingdom language

#### 0.8-1.0 (Very Strong)
**What it looks like**: Deeply Christ-centered, gospel-saturated
**Example**:
> "Jesus is Lord is not a slogan for the margins; it is the gravitational center that reshapes our people into a movement. When we receive that indicative, we are compelled toward a communal imperative—practice the way of the Kingdom in every neighborhood."

**Why it's high**: Multiple Christ references ("Jesus is Lord", "Kingdom"), gospel language ("indicative", "imperative"), biblical concepts

### Language Patterns That Increase Score

**High-Impact Terms** (use 3-5 per 100 words):
- `jesus`, `christ`, `gospel`, `kingdom`, `biblical`
- `scripture`, `god`, `lord`, `savior`, `redeemer`, `cross`
- `resurrection`, `incarnation`, `redemption`

**Sentence Patterns**:
- "Jesus is Lord..." (explicit confession)
- "The gospel compels us to..." (gospel-centered)
- "In the Kingdom..." (Kingdom language)
- "Scripture teaches..." (biblical grounding)

### How to Adjust

**To Increase**:
- Add explicit Christ references
- Include gospel language
- Reference Kingdom concepts
- Add biblical citations or allusions

**To Decrease**:
- Remove Christ references (not recommended)
- Use generic spiritual language
- Focus on abstract concepts

## 4. Narrative Imagery (Target: ≥0.5)

### What It Measures
Metaphors, stories, journey language, concrete imagery

### Score Ranges

#### 0.0-0.3 (Too Low - Abstract)
**What it looks like**: Abstract concepts, no imagery
**Example**:
> "Organizational structures require systematic analysis. Functional paradigms must be evaluated through quantitative metrics."

**Why it's low**: No metaphors, no imagery, purely abstract

#### 0.4-0.7 (Good Range)
**What it looks like**: Rich imagery, concrete metaphors
**Example**:
> "Imagine the church as a window flung open to the Kingdom wind. When we polish that window through communal holiness, neighbors glimpse the radiant story of Jesus and are invited into the pilgrimage."

**Why it's good**: Strong metaphor ("window"), journey language ("pilgrimage"), imagery ("radiant story")

#### 0.8-1.0 (Very Rich)
**What it looks like**: Dense with metaphors and imagery
**Example**:
> "The missional movement flows like a river through the landscape of our neighborhoods. Like a seed planted in good soil, it grows organically, branching out like a tree whose roots run deep into the gospel story."

**Why it's high**: Multiple metaphors ("river", "seed", "tree"), journey language ("flows", "grows", "branching"), dense imagery

### Language Patterns That Increase Score

**High-Impact Patterns**:
- Metaphor markers: `like`, `as`, `metaphor`, `symbol`, `image`, `picture`
- Journey language: `journey`, `path`, `way`, `road`, `walk`, `pilgrimage`, `travel`

**Sentence Patterns**:
- "Imagine X as Y..." (metaphor)
- "The journey of..." (journey language)
- "Like a [concrete object]..." (simile)
- "Picture this..." (imagery)

### How to Adjust

## 5. Theological Depth (Target: ≥0.4)

### What It Measures
Biblical grounding, scholarly rigor, theological terminology

### Score Ranges

#### 0.0-0.3 (Too Low - Shallow)
**What it looks like**: Practical tips, no theological grounding
**Example**:
> "Here are five ways to grow your church. First, have better music. Second, improve your website. Third, host more events."

**Why it's low**: No theological terms, no biblical references, purely practical

#### 0.4-0.6 (Good Range)
**What it looks like**: Theologically grounded but accessible
**Example**:
> "The missional DNA we steward is fractal: Jesus is Lord, disciple making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment (APEST), organic systems, and liminality that births communitas."

**Why it's good**: Theological concepts ("missional-incarnational", "apostolic", "liminality"), biblical grounding, accessible language

#### 0.7-1.0 (Very Deep)
**What it looks like**: Dense theological language, extensive biblical references
**Example**:
> "The ecclesiological implications of a missiological hermeneutic reveal the soteriological dimensions of apostolic ministry. As Paul articulates in Ephesians 4:11-12, the pneumatological distribution of charismata enables the eschatological fulfillment of the missio Dei."

**Why it's high**: Multiple theological terms, biblical citation, academic language

### Language Patterns That Increase Score

**High-Impact Terms**:
- Theological: `theology`, `doctrine`, `ecclesiology`, `missiology`, `christology`
- Advanced: `pneumatology`, `soteriology`, `eschatology`, `hermeneutics`, `exegesis`
- Concepts: `orthodoxy`, `orthopraxy`

**Biblical References**:

### How to Adjust

**To Increase**:
- Add theological terminology
- Include biblical references
- Engage with doctrine
- Reference theological concepts

**To Decrease**:
- Remove theological terms
- Focus on practical application
- Use simpler language
