### B. Integration Pattern

**Standard Structure**:

1. **Opening Question/Challenge**
   > "How do you account for the fact that..."

2. **Historical Data**
   > "The early church grew from 25,000 to 20 million..."

## III. Metaphor Usage

### A. Primary Metaphor Systems

**1. Movement/DNA Metaphors** (Use Frequently)
- Apostolic Genius, mDNA, movement DNA
- Dormant potential, activation, expression
- Genetic code, elements, components

**2. Organic/Biological Metaphors** (Use Frequently)
- Seeds, growth, fruit, roots
- Viral spread, embodiment
- Living systems, organic structures

**3. Journey/Travel Metaphors** (Use Moderately)
- On the verge, hitting the road
- Path forward, the way
- Journey, travel, movement

**4. Light/Illumination Metaphors** (Use Moderately)
- Silver imagination, awakening
- Vision, blindness, seeing
- Revelation, illumination

**5. Architectural/Structural Metaphors** (Use Moderately)
- Foundation, framework, template
- Building blocks, structure
- Blueprint, design

### B. Metaphor Guidelines

**Do**:
- Use metaphors consistently within systems
- Develop extended metaphors over paragraphs
- Connect metaphors to frameworks
- Explain metaphors when introducing
- Maintain coherence within systems

**Don't**:
- Mix incompatible metaphor systems
- Use metaphors without explanation
- Overuse metaphors (maintain balance)
- Use clichéd metaphors
- Force metaphors where inappropriate

### C. Extended Metaphor Development

**Pattern**:
1. **Introduction**: Introduce metaphor clearly
2. **Development**: Develop over 2-3 paragraphs
3. **Application**: Connect to principle/framework
4. **Extension**: Extend to new contexts carefully

**Example**:
> "Apostolic Genius is like DNA - it contains the genetic code of movements. Just as DNA determines the characteristics of living organisms, so Apostolic Genius determines the nature of authentic Jesus movements. This genetic code lies dormant in every local church, waiting to be activated. When we understand and activate this code, we unlock the potential for transformation."
