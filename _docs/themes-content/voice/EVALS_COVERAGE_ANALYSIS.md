## Evaluation Dataset Best Practices

### Optimal Dataset Size

**Industry Standards**:
- **Minimum viable**: 20-30 questions (basic coverage)
- **Recommended**: 50-100 questions (comprehensive coverage)
- **Large-scale**: 200+ questions (exhaustive coverage)
- **No maximum**: More questions = better statistical reliability

**OpenAI Recommendations**:
- Start with 20-30 examples
- Expand based on failure patterns
- Aim for 60% positive examples, 25% edge cases, 15% failure modes
- Iterate and expand continuously

### Distribution by Complexity

**Recommended Distribution** (from your guide):
- **60%** Level 1-2 questions (foundational understanding) = 30-60 questions
- **25%** Level 3 questions (application) = 12-25 questions
- **15%** Level 4-5 questions (synthesis/critical analysis) = 8-15 questions

**For 50 questions**: 30 foundational + 12 application + 8 advanced  
**For 100 questions**: 60 foundational + 25 application + 15 advanced

### Coverage Dimensions

**Topics to Cover**:
1. ✅ Apostolic Genius (core framework)
2. ✅ Movement DNA (mDNA) (core framework)
3. ✅ APEST / 5Q (core framework)

## Optimal Dataset Size: 50-100 Questions

### Why 50-100 Questions?

**Statistical Reliability**:
- **50 questions**: Good coverage, reliable pass rates, manageable evaluation time
- **100 questions**: Excellent coverage, high statistical confidence, comprehensive testing
- **200+ questions**: Diminishing returns, very long evaluation cycles

**Practical Considerations**:
- **Evaluation time**: 50 questions = ~2-3 hours, 100 questions = ~4-6 hours
- **Maintenance**: More questions = more ideal answers to maintain
- **Coverage**: 50-100 questions can cover all major frameworks and scenarios

**Recommended Target**: **75 questions**
- 45 Level 1-2 (60%)
- 19 Level 3 (25%)
- 11 Level 4-5 (15%)

### Distribution Across Topics

**For 75 questions, distribute as**:
- **Apostolic Genius**: 8 questions (already complete)
- **Movement DNA**: 8 questions (complete existing)
- **APEST / 5Q**: 8 questions (add all levels)
- **Metanoia**: 8 questions (add all levels)
- **Missional Church**: 6 questions (add all levels)
- **Movement Dynamics**: 6 questions (add all levels)
- **Organic Systems**: 6 questions (add all levels)
- **Framework Integration**: 6 questions (complete existing)
- **Disciplism**: 6 questions (new set)
- **Reframation**: 5 questions (new set)
- **Liminality/Communitas**: 5 questions (new set)
- **Contextual Application**: 3 questions (new set)

## Is More Better?

### Yes, But With Diminishing Returns

**Benefits of More Questions**:
- ✅ Better statistical reliability
- ✅ More comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Better regression detection
- ✅ More edge case testing
- ✅ Higher confidence in agent quality

**Costs of More Questions**:
- ❌ Longer evaluation cycles
- ❌ More maintenance (ideal answers to update)
- ❌ Diminishing returns after ~100 questions
- ❌ Higher computational costs

### Sweet Spot: 50-100 Questions

**Why This Range**:
1. **Coverage**: Covers all major frameworks and scenarios
2. **Reliability**: Statistically reliable pass rates
3. **Practicality**: Manageable evaluation time (2-6 hours)
4. **Maintainability**: Reasonable number of ideal answers to maintain
5. **Cost**: Balanced evaluation costs

**Beyond 100 Questions**:
- Only add if you identify specific gaps
- Focus on edge cases and failure modes
- Consider separate "advanced" eval set

## Conclusion

### Current State: Insufficient

**You have**: ~7-15 questions (many incomplete)  
**You need**: 50-100 questions for comprehensive coverage  
**Gap**: ~35-85 questions

### Recommendation: Expand to 75 Questions

**Why 75**:
- Comprehensive coverage of all frameworks
- Statistically reliable
- Manageable evaluation time
- Reasonable maintenance burden

**How to Get There**:
1. Complete existing 8 Q&A sets (Priority 1)
2. Add 3 missing core frameworks (Priority 2)
3. Add application/context questions (Priority 3)
4. Add edge cases as needed (Priority 4)

### No Maximum, But Diminishing Returns

**More is better**, but:
- Focus on **quality** over quantity
- Ensure **ideal answers** are authoritative
- Maintain **coverage** across all frameworks
- Balance **comprehensiveness** with **practicality**

**Target**: 75 questions (comprehensive, reliable, manageable)  
**Maximum**: No hard limit, but 100+ has diminishing returns  
**Minimum**: 50 questions for basic reliability

---

## Next Steps

1. **Audit current questions**: Count exact number, identify gaps
2. **Prioritize completion**: Start with Priority 1 (complete existing sets)
3. **Generate questions**: Use SSOT content as source material
4. **Create ideal answers**: Alan edits these (authoritative source)
5. **Iterate**: Add questions based on evaluation failures

**Remember**: Each ideal answer is the authoritative source. Quality > quantity. But you need sufficient quantity for statistical reliability.
