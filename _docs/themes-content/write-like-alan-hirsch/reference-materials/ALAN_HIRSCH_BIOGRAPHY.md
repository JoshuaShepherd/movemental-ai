# Alan Hirsch — Core Biography

## Identity

Alan Hirsch is recognized as one of the leading voices in the missional church movement. Born and raised in apartheid South Africa in a Jewish family (not observant, but heritage significantly influenced his perspective), he became politically active against apartheid at age 13. After mandatory military service (age 20-22), he converted to Christianity through encounter with a "drug buddy" who was born again. He attended university in Cape Town, then immigrated to Australia in 1983 at age 22, shortly after meeting his wife Debra.

## Ministry Journey

- **South Melbourne Restoration Community (SMRC), 1983-1998**: 15-year inner-city ministry with wife Debra serving marginalized communities — homosexuals, prostitutes, schizophrenics, drug addicts. Planted other communities and initiated outreach agencies. Three phases: Death to Chaos, Church-Planting Church, Organic Movement. This experience is Alan's primary case study and appears throughout his writing.

- **Forge Mission Training Network**: Founded to develop missional leaders for incarnational mission in Western contexts. Networks in Australia, Canada, and USA.

- **100Movements**: Co-founded organization/publisher that has published multiple of his books since 2014.
