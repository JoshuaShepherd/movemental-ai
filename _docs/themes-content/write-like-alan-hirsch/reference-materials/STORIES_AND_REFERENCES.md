## Personal Stories

### SMRC (South Melbourne Restoration Community)
15-year ministry (1983-1998) with wife Debra, serving marginalized communities in inner-city Melbourne — homosexuals, prostitutes, schizophrenics, drug addicts. Three phases:
1. **Death to Chaos**: Raw, unstructured beginnings
2. **Church-Planting Church**: Planting other communities
3. **Organic Movement**: Movement dynamics emerging

This is Alan's primary case study. It appears in every major book.

### George and John
Two Greek brothers, drug dealers who came to faith. George chose jail over paying parking fines, took his mother's "big, fat Greek family Bible" to prison, encountered God. Used KJV Bible and "Late Great Planet Earth" video. Within 6 months, led 50+ people to faith. Within three months of his release, "about sixty-five people had given their lives to the Lord."

### The Main House
Former brothel turned community center. Pat Kavanagh's redemptive love. "Drug deals going on in the back rooms and Bible studies in the front." Despite chaos, something "wonderfully apostolic" about the group.

### Dual Role
Directing DMED while leading SMRC "nearly killed me" but gave strategic perspective — experiencing both the pastoral and the systemic simultaneously.

## Historical Movement Stories

### Early Church (AD 100-310)
- Grew from 25,000 to 20 million in 200 years
- No buildings, no Scriptures, no professional leadership — yet exponential growth
- The purest expression of Apostolic Genius
- Persecuted for 250+ years yet multiplied
- Key data point: shows what's possible when mDNA is activated

### Chinese Underground Church
- 2 million in 1949, 120 million today
- Systematic persecution by Communist state removed all external structures
- "All unnecessary complexities are extracted"
- "A simple, reproducible, transferable faith is born"
- Shows: distill to "Jesus is Lord" and multiplication follows
- Growth pattern: 60x in 70 years

### Methodist Movement
- Wesley's movement: one in thirty in Britain, 2% to 34% in America
- Class meetings as simple, reproducible system
- Movement killers identified: professionalization (1850) and optional discipleship (1860)
- Shows: how movements die when complexity replaces simplicity

### CMA (Church Multiplication Associates)
- Neil Cole's movement: 10,000+ churches in a decade
- Life Transformation Groups (LTGs) as simple, reproducible system
- Contemporary example of Apostolic Genius

### Celtic Missionary Movement
- Patrick's movement across Ireland
- Monasteries as missional communities
- Integration of local culture with gospel message

### Moravian Movement
- Count Zinzendorf's community
- 24/7 prayer meeting lasting 100 years

## Cultural Reference Stories

### Wizard of Oz
Dorothy had ruby slippers all along — answers already within us. Used to illustrate: Apostolic Genius lies dormant in every church. "We already have what we need."

### The Mission (Film)
Father Gabriel and cultural distance. Through music, established bridge across cultural chasm. All gospel communication is now cross-cultural.

### Burning Man
Alan and Deb regularly attend. Six elements Alan observes: belonging, survival, empowerment, sensuality, celebration, liminality. "What church is supposed to offer" — people seeking community, transcendence, and shared ordeal outside institutional religion.

### The Children of Men (Film)
Parabolic pointer to church infertility. "After 20 centuries, we haven't seen the transformation implied in the gospel." The inability to reproduce as a theological crisis.

### The Matrix
Taking the red pill — choosing to see reality as it actually is. Metanoia as paradigm shift that cannot be reversed.

### Groundhog Day
Repeating the same day — the church repeating the same failed patterns. The Sisyphean task.

### The Simpsons ("Missionary Impossible")
Homer as "Jeebus" missionary — knowing nothing about Jesus yet claiming his name. The danger of Christological ignorance.
