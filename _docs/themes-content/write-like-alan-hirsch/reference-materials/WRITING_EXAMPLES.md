## Example 1: Article Opening — Hook, Reframe, Thesis
**Source**: *Reframation*, Chapter 1: "Moving the Moon"

Alan opens with Martin Buber's metaphor of a solar eclipse — the Sun doesn't move; something moves between us and the Sun. He pivots this into "an eclipse of God" where "objects, ideas, and idols insert themselves into our viewpoint, obscuring our capacity to view God in all his fullness." He layers Charles Taylor's "immanent frame" and Benjamin Mann's lament about loss of transcendence, arriving at the thesis: "The crisis of the modern world is the 'eclipse of God.'"

Key opening line: "In his book, The Eclipse of God, Martin Buber points out that a solar eclipse is something that concerns the relation of our eyes to the Sun, rather than a movement or changing of the Sun itself."

**Voice markers**: Narrative imagery (eclipse metaphor sustained across paragraphs), theological depth (Buber, Taylor's "immanent frame," Aquinas), prophetic intensity ("this fading of God from human consciousness has been catastrophic"), Christocentric anchoring (problem framed as obscured vision of God).

**Form technique**: HOOK with borrowed metaphor, EXTEND into theological territory, LAYER scholarly voices, LAND on reframing thesis, LIST cultural forces to make abstract concrete.

## Example 2: Blog/Reflection Style — Personal, Conversational, One Idea
**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Preface to the Second Edition

Alan recounts the personal moment when Apostolic Genius crystallized — "a flash of revelatory insight." He reflects on being a "custodian" rather than inventor: "I am a mere custodian — and I hope a faithful one — of that which has been vouchsafed to me." He notes feedback consistently says people feel they "kinda already knew this" — confirming the Spirit is "once again brooding over the church."

**Voice markers**: Pastoral warmth (first-person vulnerability, genuine humility), theological depth (stewardship language, Matthew 25:23 allusion, "brooding" Spirit echoing Genesis 1), prophetic intensity (claims revelatory origin), speaking from ahead (recovery of something ancient).

**Form technique**: PERSONAL ENTRY, HONEST POSITIONING (disclaims ownership, claims stewardship), CONFIRMATION FROM OTHERS, THEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION, SINGLE IDEA explored from multiple angles.

## Example 3: Book Chapter Opening — Narrative Entry, Tension, Direction
**Source**: *Untamed*, Chapter 1: "Jeebus Made Me Do It"

Alan opens with a Simpsons episode where Homer becomes a missionary despite knowing nothing about Jesus — crying "Jeebus? Jeebus? But I don't know Jeebus!" Homer builds a casino on the island, introducing "alcohol, gambling, and violence." Alan pivots: "We start the chapter with this story because it highlights the impact of how ignorance of Jesus by those who claim his name is toxic."

Key pivot: "Following 'Jeebus,' Homer wreaked utter havoc on the population, and we are left wondering if this does not describe large tracts of Christian history equally well."

**Voice markers**: Narrative imagery (pop-culture as theological parable), prophetic intensity (Homer-to-Christian-history comparison is sharp), Christocentric anchoring (recovering real Jesus vs. "Jeebus"), pastoral warmth ("we of all people do not want to say that God doesn't use the odd Homers").

**Form technique**: POP-CULTURE NARRATIVE entry, DETAILED RETELLING, PIVOT from comedy to prophetic challenge, GRACIOUS QUALIFIER, THESIS SIGNAL.

## Example 4: Framework Teaching — Definition + Biblical Grounding + Metaphor
**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 3: "Preparing for the Journey"

Alan introduces mDNA by first defining biological DNA from the Encyclopedia Britannica, then mapping it onto ecclesiology. He lists DNA's properties (found in every cell, self-replicating, carries vital information) and declares: "What DNA does for biological systems, mDNA does for ecclesial ones."

Key metaphorical move: "Because of the latency of mDNA in [every church]... the future is in the womb of the present."

**Voice markers**: Theological depth (scientific metaphor to ecclesiological principle), narrative imagery (DNA metaphor sustained — cells, organisms, seeds), speaking from ahead ("The possibility of movement lies at the heart of every church"), Christocentric anchoring (mDNA grounded in Jesus movements).

**Form technique**: BORROWED VOCABULARY, AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITION, METAPHORICAL MAPPING, HISTORICAL VALIDATION, LATENCY CLAIM.

## Example 5: Historical Example Development — Data, Principle, Application
**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 4: "The Heart of It All: Jesus Is Lord"

Alan develops the Chinese underground church as case study. Historical data: persecution removed "all external structures and reference points." Growth "from around 2 million to around 120 million in seventy years." Mechanism: "a simple, reproducible, transferable faith is born" when "all unnecessary complexities are extracted."

Key principle: "At the heart of all great movements is a recovery of a simple, uncluttered message — one that accurately reflects the Jesus of New Testament faith — they are Jesus-shaped movements."

**Voice markers**: Christocentric anchoring ("Faith is once again linked in utter simplicity to Jesus"), theological depth (movement theory, viral dynamics), prophetic intensity (implicit challenge to "weighty systematic theologies"), narrative imagery (viral metaphor, stripping/distilling language).

**Form technique**: HISTORICAL QUESTION, MECHANISM IDENTIFICATION, STRIPPING METAPHOR, MIRACLE MOMENT, CONTEMPORARY APPLICATION, VIRAL ANALOGY.

## Example 6: Story / Personal Narrative — Lived Experience, Theological Reflection
**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Chapter 1: "A View from the Edge"

Alan tells the SMRC origin story. "A Greek guy named George" — a drug dealer who chose jail over paying parking fines, took his mother's "big, fat Greek family Bible" to prison, encountered God, emerged to evangelize his network. Within three months, "about sixty-five people had given their lives to the Lord!" The community included "gays, lesbians, goths, drug addicts... rabid party animals." The main house, "previously used as a brothel," had "drug deals going on in the back rooms and Bible studies in the front."

**Voice markers**: Pastoral warmth ("if the reader will indulge me"), narrative imagery (vivid, gritty detail), Christocentric anchoring (radical conversion through encounter with Jesus), theological depth (chaos as seedbed for movement theory).

**Form technique**: PERMISSION-SEEKING, CHARACTER INTRODUCTION, COMIC DETAIL, ESCALATION, CONTRAST, THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION emerging from lived chaos.

## Example 7: Prophetic Challenge — Naming What's Wrong, Calling for Change
**Source**: *Metanoia*, Chapter 1: "The Apocalypse of the Ecclesial Soul"

Alan frames the current moment as sovereign judgment: "judgment begins with the household of God (1 Peter 4:17)." Prophetic questions: "What is God saying to us in these portentous events? What is being revealed about us in this crisis? What must change?" Fourfold crisis: spiritual, missiological, theological, ecclesiological.

Key prophetic line: "If we fail to respond faithfully to our particular kairos moment, then we effectively abdicate our responsibility before God."

**Voice markers**: Prophetic intensity ("we are being collectively weighed in the balance"), Christocentric anchoring (crisis as God's sovereign action), theological depth (kairos theology, 1 Peter 4:17, Sisyphus analogy), pastoral warmth ("as believers we must recognize that the sovereign Lord of history is somehow at work").

**Form technique**: THEOLOGICAL FRAMING, INTERROGATIVE BATTERY, CATEGORICAL NAMING, ESCALATING URGENCY, WARNING, KAIROS LANGUAGE.

---

## Example 8: Scripture Integration — Organic Weaving, Not Proof-Texting
**Source**: *Disciplism*, Chapter 6: "It's All About Jesus"

Alan weaves Scripture into an argument about Christological correction. Moves from Ephesians and Colossians to Romans 8:28-30 to 1 John 2:5-6 — none cited as proof-texts but flowing naturally. Central move: "we have (inadvertently) committed probably the most dangerous heresy of all by divorcing the work of Jesus from the person of Jesus."

Key integrative line: "Discipleship is about Christ being formed in you and you being formed in Christ."

**Voice markers**: Christocentric anchoring (recovering fullness of Jesus), Scripture integration (5+ references woven into flowing prose), prophetic intensity ("the most dangerous heresy of all"), pastoral warmth ("In other words, discipleship is about Christ being formed in you").

**Form technique**: PERSONAL ANCHOR, SCRIPTURAL FLOW, BOTH/AND REFRAMING, ESCALATING STAKES, PAULINE LANGUAGE repurposed.

## Example 9: Closing / Vision Statement — Forward-Looking, Never Summary
**Source**: *The Forgotten Ways*, Conclusion

Alan closes with vision: "Jesus's people have always contained the possibilities of the earth's immense future — the kingdom of God." He names responsibility: "the discovery of great truths brings a certain responsibility" and "the potential that has lain hidden at the very heart of God's people for much too long." Continuity: "as it was for Paul, the early church, and all throughout the ages, so it will be for us."

**Voice markers**: Speaking from ahead (hidden potential as present reality), Christocentric anchoring (Jesus's people, kingdom of God), prophetic intensity (responsibility language), pastoral warmth ("our deepest heritage").

**Form technique**: NO SUMMARY, VISION DECLARATION, RESPONSIBILITY LANGUAGE, HISTORICAL CONTINUITY, SINGLE-SENTENCE LANDING.

---

## Example 10: Question Reframing — "That's the Wrong Question"
**Source**: *The Permanent Revolution*, Chapter 1

Alan opens with the myth of Sisyphus — declares "the historic church has been engaged in a Sisyphean task." The implicit wrong question is "How do we push harder?" His reframe: the problem is not effort but design. "to mess with the DNA of the church (that is, its original design and function) means to seriously damage our capacity to actually be ecclesia."

Key reframing line: "We are called to believe that Jesus has given us everything that we need to be the kind of church that he intended us to be."

**Voice markers**: Narrative imagery (Sisyphus myth sustained), prophetic intensity ("we have been our own worst enemy"), theological depth (genetic mutation analogy, Ephesians 4), Christocentric anchoring (Jesus gave "everything that we need").

**Form technique**: MYTHIC ENTRY, IDENTIFICATION, IMPLICIT WRONG QUESTION, REFRAME, LOGICAL CHAIN, SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS.

## Cross-Corpus Patterns

Across all 10 examples from 8 different books:

**Structural**: Never opens with abstract theology — always image, story, question, or metaphor. Pivots from concrete to theological within 2-3 paragraphs. Layers multiple voices — Scripture, scholars, pop culture, personal experience. Closes forward, never backward.

**Voice signatures**: "We" dominance. Borrowed metaphors sustained across paragraphs. Prophetic-pastoral tension. Scripture as flowing argument. History as theological evidence. Latency language — "hidden," "forgotten," "already there," "womb of the present."

**Christological center**: Every example returns to Jesus regardless of topic. Not decorative but structural — Jesus is the organizing principle of every argument.
