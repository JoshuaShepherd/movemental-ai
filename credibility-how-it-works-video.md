## Video Script (Full Narration)

*Scene numbers [S1]–[S24] map to the Remotion asset list below. Each scene is one composition or one primary visual.*

---

**[S1 — TITLE]**  
*[0:00–0:08]*  
**VO:** How does credibility actually work? And what do you do about it when the internet can’t tell the difference between you and everyone else? This is the story—from the room to the algorithm.

---

**[S2 — CREDIBILITY IS A JUDGMENT]**  
*[0:08–0:28]*  
**VO:** Credibility isn’t a substance. It’s a judgment. Someone holds you credible *for something*, *to someone*, *in a context*. We grant it when we have reason to believe you’re reliable—track record, consistency, who points to you. We don’t run a checklist. We sense it. We say: I trust this person on this. At the human level, credibility is a network of judgments. Not a score.

---

**[S3 — OFFLINE: TWO CHANNELS]**  
*[0:28–0:45]*  
**VO:** Offline, credibility travels two ways. **Institutions**—publishers, universities, networks—attach a signal: we vetted this, we put our name on it. A book from Baker or Zondervan carries that. And **people**—colleagues, peers, gatekeepers—vouch. They invite you, cite you, put you in the room. So: institutional imprimatur, and relational vouching. Both slow. Both gated. Credibility is something others confer. You can’t unilaterally declare it.

---

**[S4 — ONLINE: EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME]**  
*[0:45–1:05]*  
**VO:** Online, the same need remains—who do I trust?—but everything arrives in the same format. A blog, a paper, a press release: they look identical. The old signals are flattened. So platforms and algorithms step in. They don’t care about truth; they care about engagement and proxies for “worth surfacing.” One of the main arbiters of digital credibility is **E-E-A-T**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Make the author legible. Show what they’ve done. Show who points to them. Behave in trustworthy ways. The signal online is: who created this, and are they connected?

---

**[S5 — CLAIM VS NODE]**  
*[1:05–1:35]*  
**VO:** Take a good article. By itself it’s a **claim**. “I know this; here’s my take.” It exists. But the internet doesn’t know it’s there. Now run the full SEO thing—structure, metadata, internal links—and add a **linking plan**: get a moderate network of relevant sites to link to it. The words might not change. So what changed? The piece of content is no longer just a claim. It becomes a **node**. It’s discoverable. Legible to systems. Connected—other nodes point to it. Weighted—who links matters. Same article. Same claim. But now it has **findability and graph position**. Offline, “Baker published this” did that work. Online, you replicate it through your own platform, SEO, and links. Claim plus discoverability plus graph position. Without that, you’re mostly invisible.

---

**[S6 — SCENIUS VS PUBLISHER]**  
*[1:35–2:00]*  
**VO:** So can a **scenius**—a visible network of peers who vouch for each other—replace or supplement the Baker or Zondervan model in 2026? Yes, for a defined audience. If your people already care about a movement or a tradition, they don’t need a publisher’s imprint. They need to see your work, your voice, and your connections to others they trust. The network does the vouching. The graph becomes the signal. It’s viable for the right people—not for everyone in a Barnes & Noble, but for being the go-to voice inside a movement.

---

**[S7 — THE PLAYBOOK]**  
*[2:00–2:35]*  
**VO:** So what do you do? This isn’t a list of hacks. **One:** Own one home—one place where your name, work, and affiliations are clear. **Two:** Make the author legible. E-E-A-T in plain language: who you are, what you’ve done, who you’re connected to. **Three:** Publish and structure for findability. Good writing first; then structure so your best content can be found. **Four:** Build and show the graph. Link to peers. Get linked. Be in the scenius visibly. **Five:** Protect the gap. Don’t overclaim. Credibility is moral—it’s built on consistency between who you are offline and who you appear to be online. Success isn’t go viral. It’s **faithful reach**: the right people find you, trust you, and carry your work forward.

---

**[S8 — THE CHECKLIST]**  
*[2:35–3:00]*  
**VO:** Before you amplify, get clear. **Do you have credibility?** You do if people who matter already trust you—peers invite you, your people cite you, gatekeepers point to you. **Is it online credibility?** That’s when the same trust is legible and findable on the internet. If you have credibility but it’s not yet online, the task is translation—making what’s already true about you visible and connected. If you don’t yet have credibility, the playbook won’t manufacture it; it only amplifies what’s there. Get clear on which box you’re in.

---

**[S9 — IF YES: AMPLIFY]**  
*[3:00–3:20]*  
**VO:** If yes—one home, author legible, content as nodes, linking in and out, restraint. Amplification means making existing credibility legible and connected so it can circulate. Not more followers. Not viral. Legible and connected.

---

**[S10 — 100 IN THE SYSTEM]**  
*[3:20–3:50]*  
**VO:** What does it mean when a hundred movement leaders are in this system? You get a real graph—nodes and edges, links and citations. A hundred coherent platforms. Cross-linking built in. “Who points to you” becomes answerable. Content circulates inside the ecology. Mutual elevation—success for one lifts the network. Bounded scale: at a hundred, people can still know each other and vouch. So: a real, visible, linkable credibility graph. Not infinite scale. Enough for discoverability, vouching, and circulation.

---

**[S11 — VALUE & REVENUE]**  
*[3:50–4:10]*  
**VO:** Value for the movement? A credibility ecology—content that matters can move. Faithful reach. Content that compounds. And revenue? Many leaders have strong credibility but little from *owned* digital content. Books return 10–15%. A credibility ecosystem makes you findable and lets you keep the majority of revenue from your content. So owned content can contribute to sustainability. Not get rich—sustainable.

---

**[S12 — STEWARDSHIP]**  
*[4:10–4:30]*  
**VO:** How do you steward a system like this? Curation over growth. Quality and accountability. Transparency—who’s in, how they’re linked. Infrastructure that serves participants, not extraction. Refusal to scale past the point where relational credibility breaks. And nurture the graph—links, collaboration, relationships. Stewarding is active and moral.

---

**[S13 — HOW DO YOU KNOW?]**  
*[4:30–4:55]*  
**VO:** How does one even know when they’re credible? There’s no single meter. But you can look for signs. Your people find you—they land on you when they search. Your peers point to you—you get invited, cited, put in the room. Your work moves—taught, linked, quoted. And the ask matches the claim—people come to you for what you’re actually good at. If yes to those, you’re building credibility. If not, the playbook isn’t more content or more tricks. It’s making what’s already true about you visible and connected—so the people who are supposed to trust you can finally see why they should.

---

**[S14 — CLOSING]**  
*[4:55–5:15]*  
**VO:** Credibility is a judgment. Offline it travels through institutions and people. Online it travels through legibility and topology—one home, author legible, content as nodes, the graph. You’re not trying to be famous. You’re trying to be found and trusted by the right people. That’s how credibility works. And that’s what you’re building.

## Remotion Timeline Suggestion

- **Total duration:** ~5:15 (script) + ~0:30 buffer for pauses and transitions ≈ **5:45–6:00**.
- **Scene duration:** 8–30s per scene; average ~12s.
- **Transitions:** Use **BUMPER_TRANSITION** between Parts (e.g. after Offline, after Claim→Node, after Playbook, after 100, before Closing).
- **Voiceover:** Record full script; align each [S*] block to the corresponding asset. Assets 12–15 (Claim→Node) can share one composition with 4 phases (claim alone → +SEO → +links → full graph).
- **Export:** 1080p or 4K; 24fps or 30fps. Optional: export segments for web (e.g. “Part 1: What is credibility”) as clips.

---

## Image/GIF Sourcing Notes

- **Icons:** Use a consistent set (e.g. Lucide, Heroicons, or custom line) for E-E-A-T, playbook steps, stewardship, signs.
- **Abstract visuals:** Prefer Remotion-built (shapes, paths, layout) for graphs and “flattened format” so they match the narrative exactly.
- **Photography:** Only if needed for “room,” “people”; otherwise silhouettes or abstract figures keep the explainer timeless and on-message.
- **GIFs:** Optional for “content stuck” vs “content moving” (e.g. orbit vs network flow); can be replaced by Remotion animation (two compositions).

If you want, the next step is a `remotion/` folder structure and a `CredibilityVideo.tsx` composition that imports these 32 assets and wires them to the script timings above.
