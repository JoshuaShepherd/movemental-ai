People praise your competence, your availability, your willingness to step in when others can\'t.' },

Your capacity becomes the ceiling for everyone else\'s growth.' },

Problems get solved, decisions get made, crises get averted. But over time, the cracks begin to show. Your team stops taking initiative because they\'ve learned you\'ll do it better. Emerging leaders stop developing because they never get the chance to try and fail and learn.' },

And ironically, the very people you\'re trying to help become dependent rather than developed.' },

It requires a fundamentally different mindset—one that moves from addition to multiplication, from doing to developing, from leading to leading leaders.

We calculate impact by what we personally contribute—the sermons we preach, the decisions we make, the people we counsel, the strategies we develop. If we want to increase our impact, we work harder, put in more hours, take on more responsibility. This is addition thinking: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.' },

What if every person you developed could develop others, who could develop others, who could develop others? This is multiplication thinking: 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, then 16, then 32, then 64.' },

But if you invest in ten people who each invest in ten more, you\'ve multiplied to one hundred. And if those one hundred each invest in ten, you\'ve reached one thousand—all from your initial investment in ten.' },

You spend less time solving problems and more time coaching others to solve them. You spend less time doing ministry and more time developing ministers.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'I remember the first time I truly embraced multiplication thinking. A crisis emerged in one of our ministries, and my instinct was to step in and fix it. But instead, I asked myself: Who could I develop through this situation? I called a young leader on our team and said, "I think you\'re the right person to handle this. I\'ll coach you through it, but this is your opportunity to lead."' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'It was harder than doing it myself. It took more time, more patience, more trust. But watching that leader rise to the challenge, work through the complexity, and emerge with new confidence and capability—that was multiplication. And the next time a similar crisis arose, I didn\'t have to be involved at all. That leader could handle it, and they could coach someone else through it too.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'Multiplication leaders ask different questions. Instead of "How can I do this better?" they ask "How can I develop someone to do this?" Instead of "What do I need to accomplish?" they ask "Who do I need to invest in?" Instead of "How do I solve this problem?" they ask "Who can I coach to solve this problem?"' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'The multiplication mindset also requires a longer time horizon. Addition produces immediate results—you do something, it gets done. Multiplication requires investment, patience, and trust. You invest in someone who might fail, who will certainly struggle, who won\'t do it as well as you could—at least not at first. But over time, they grow. They develop. They multiply. And eventually, they surpass you.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'This is the power of the multiplication mindset. It transforms your leadership from a solo performance into a movement. It shifts your impact from what you can accomplish in your lifetime to what generations of leaders you\'ve developed can accomplish long after you\'re gone. It\'s the difference between being a hero and making heroes.' }

This sounds simple, but in practice, it\'s one of the most difficult shifts a leader can make. Why? Because giving permission means giving up control.' },

They micromanage decisions. They step in at the first sign of struggle. They say "Go for it" but really mean "Go for it exactly the way I would do it." This isn\'t permission giving—it\'s permission withholding with a thin veneer of empowerment.' },

It means you allow people to try, fail, learn, and grow. It means you resist the urge to swoop in and save the day every time something doesn\'t go according to plan. It means you believe in people\'s potential more than you trust in your own ability to control outcomes.' },

A young leader on our team came to me with an idea that I thought was misguided. My first instinct was to explain why it wouldn\'t work and suggest a better approach. But before I could, I paused and asked myself: What would happen if I gave permission instead of direction?' },

I committed to supporting her, coaching her, and helping her learn regardless of the outcome. And then I let go. It was terrifying. But it was also transformative—for both of us.' },

But through the process, she learned more about leadership, problem-solving, and resilience than any amount of instruction from me could have taught her. And she came back with a revised approach that was actually better than anything I would have suggested. Giving permission unlocked something in her—a sense of ownership, creativity, and confidence that only comes when someone truly believes you trust them to lead.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'Permission giving doesn\'t mean abandoning people. It doesn\'t mean throwing them into the deep end without support. It means clearly defining boundaries, providing resources, offering coaching, and then trusting them to lead within those parameters. It means being available to guide without being compelled to control.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'In practical terms, permission giving looks like this: You identify emerging leaders with potential. You invite them into opportunities slightly beyond their current capacity. You clarify expectations and boundaries. You provide resources and support. And then you step back and let them lead. You resist the urge to micromanage. You celebrate progress, not perfection. You debrief both successes and failures as learning opportunities.' },
                { type: 'p', text: 'The most powerful question a permission-giving leader asks is not "How can I make this better?" but "How can I help you grow through this?" This question shifts the focus from the task to the person, from the outcome to the development. It communicates trust, investment, and belief. And it creates a culture where people feel empowered to take initiative, make decisions, and lead with confidence.' },

Until you genuinely give others permission to lead—to make decisions, to take risks, to fail and learn—you cannot develop them into the leaders they\'re capable of becoming. And until you develop leaders, you cannot multiply your impact. It all begins with permission. The question is: Are you ready to give it?' }
