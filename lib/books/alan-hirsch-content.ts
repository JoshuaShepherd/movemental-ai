They happen when an element which may even be important, but isn’t central, looms so large that people can’t help talking about it, fixating on it, debating different views of it as though this were the only thing that mattered. ## — N. T. W R I G H T Alas! the world is full of enormous lights and mysteries, and man shuts them from himself with one small hand! ## — RABBI YISRAEL BAAL SHEM TOV > If you comprehend God, he is not God. A comprehended God is no God at all. ## — THOMAS AQUINAS In his book, The Eclipse of God, Martin Buber points out that a solar eclipse is something that concerns the relation of our eyes to the Sun, rather than a movement or changing of the Sun itself. Although an eclipse appears to impact the Sun, in fact it has no influence on it at all.1 Seen from the perspective of Earth, a solar eclipse is caused by the Moon moving between the Earth and the Sun and therefore blocking all or some of the Sun from Earth’s view. Similarly, an “eclipse of God” occurs not because God moves away from our sight, but rather because objects, ideas, and idols insert themselves into our viewpoint, obscuring our capacity to view God in all his fullness. ## The Eclipse Of God We now understand that after a short period of time the Sun reappears at the end of an eclipse, as the Moon moves out of its path. But our understanding has not always been this advanced. Primitive beliefs viewed an eclipse as an apocalyptic event. As the darkness came upon the people in the middle of the day, and as they saw the Sun disappearing and felt the cold breezes starting to surround them, their limited understanding caused them to believe that the Sun had died and the world was ending. Although this is an inaccurate scientific interpretation of a solar eclipse, there is metaphorical significance in suggesting that a world that has lost connection to its radiant Sun (God) is a world that is ending, and that it is a dark and precarious place.2 The eclipse (or concealment of God) is therefore a powerful twentyfirst-century metaphor because it explains so much about the struggle we face to know God. The eminent philosopher Charles Taylor talks about the secular West as being trapped in what he calls “the immanent frame”— meaning that we find ourselves enclosed (framed) within a view of the world that locks out the possibility of transcendence. Our awareness of God is therefore obscured and eclipsed, and we find ourselves cut off from the enchanted, theistic, sacramental worldview that has been lost in the last three centuries or so.3 The process by which we arrived at this unfortunate state has been considerably analyzed by some of our greatest thinkers.4 In summary, it is the net result of the confluence of cultural and intellectual forces that have been growing for the last 500 or so years and have snowballed in the middle to late twentieth century.5 Rather than pointing creation toward their Source, a host of influences, including ideologies, events, idols, and people, are in fact obscuring a culture’s awareness and perception of God. And this fading of God from human consciousness has been catastrophic. Benjamin Mann, a one-time atheist, now a Catholic priest, laments: > God’s eclipse means the loss of an infinite horizon, and its replacement > with a purely finite sphere: in which our freedom has no higher goal or > reference point, principled values are indistinct from mere preferences, Man was never meant to live in such a world; he cannot make sense of it, or make sense of himself within it. Yet this—despite the persistent personal faith of a great many individuals—is the kind of world in which we increasingly live our common life. Moving the Moon 5 The crisis of the modern world is not primarily its moral disorientation— which is serious, but largely symptomatic. Nor is it the loss of specific, traditional religious faith—which is also alarming, but is really one part of a greater whole. The crisis of the modern world is the “eclipse of God.”6 The issue is not just a loss of traditional religious faith and a declining church but a more profound loss of our whole sense of transcendence, our spiritual instincts, and our consciousness of the divine. It is a growing blindness and deafness to the Eternal, and we find ourselves tragically limited to the horizon of this finite world, such that we “no longer grasp the ‘transcendent’ character of our ‘existence as man.’”7 People (both in the church and out of it) increasingly lack the plausibility structures to make sense of faith in God, or their place in the world. Seminal British missiologist John V. Taylor names those who reduce every vertical to a horizontal, all language to the literal meaning of words, and all relation with God to a relation with others, as “contemporary flat earthers.”8 This loss of a sense of the divine can be traced to numerous cultural forces prevalent in our day, such as: - the ever-present secularism as a dominant worldview that eliminates religious expression (Taylor’s “immanent frame”) - the philosophical atheism that has dominated the arts and science over the last 120 years - the specializing tendencies of scientific methods that reduce a total vision in order to study the parts - the rampant materialism that has very effectively supplanted the role of religion - the anti-religious bias of psychology and the social sciences - the pervasiveness of capitalism and the associated market forces that inevitably reduce people to economic units of consumption - the domination of depersonalizing technique and data, and - the polarizing political propaganda that we are subjected to every day. It’s no wonder people can’t seem to find God—so many things have moved in to obscure our vision. As a result of the coalition of these and other forces, we now see the world as an object to be categorized and consumed—a significant move away from the premodern perception, which considered the world to be the realm of the sacred. In many ways, it is this shift in perspective that has destroyed the opportunity for intimacy with an eternal, ever-present God. God is still here (he never moved); it is we who have lost our sense of spiritual attunement. God is revealing himself to us but our senses are blunted, and we no longer have the eyes to see him. God is speaking to us but we have lost the ears to hear him and lack the language to respond.9 When an animal can only hear certain ranges of sound, or a man is color blind, it is not that the sound or the color is absent, but that there is an inability to perceive. So it is with the silence and speech of God: we can no longer “see” (recognize) or “hear” (respond to) God. We have little in terms of common language or concept within which to frame a true knowledge of God. The real problem at this moment in history is that God is “disappearing” from the human horizon. Consequently, the light that comes from him is dimming, and humanity is losing its bearings, with increasingly destructive effects.10 ## The Great Reduction Alongside the eclipsing of God, there has been a corresponding loss of the whole due to a focusing on the parts. In other words, we have lost a sense of the big Story that makes sense of all our little stories. It is this loss of wholeness that contributes to the eclipse, concealing and alienating us from the truth of the one God—and it is this loss of the whole that lies at the core of heresy. In its original meaning, the word heresy does not infer that someone is wrong or has believed a falsehood. Rather, it simply refers to a particular truth or belief that has been extracted from its true and complete context and is subsequently treated as if it were the whole truth. This explains why every heretic in the history of the church has had a verse or two of Scripture they rigidly hold to. Or, as N. T. Wright notes: > The greatest heresies do not come about by straightforward denial […] > They happen when an element which may even be important, but isn’t > central, looms so large that people can’t help talking about it, fixating on > mattered.11 > that has been lost, ignored, or suppressed. That is something to get excited > Moving the Moon 7 > and sectarian by making the newly-recovered particular truth into the > greater Truth from which it has been extracted.12 Truth thereby becomes The poet Rumi lamented this shattering of truth: The Truth was a mirror in the hands of God. It fell, and broke into pieces. Everybody took a piece of it and they looked at it and thought they had the truth.13 Heresy is not exclusive to theology and religion. If we look into just about every other domain of knowledge, we can see that this sort of reductionism affects everything. For instance, it happens when ideas—be they theological, political or sociological—are reduced and distilled into a singular controlling “ideology” through which the insiders interpret their world and organize their purposes in order to act on it.14 In the fields of science and philosophy, heresy occurs when knowledge becomes over-specialized and fractured, leading to various specialties warring with one another about who is really correct. Bemoaning this very fact, the philosopher E. F. Schumacher quotes the renowned psychiatrist Viktor Frankl as saying that: > The present danger does not really lie in the loss of universality on the > part of the scientist, but rather in his pretense and claim of totality […] > What we have to deplore therefore is not so much the fact that scientists > true nihilism of today is reductionism […] Contemporary nihilism no > as nothing-but-ness.15 > the monomaniac or fanatic is the result. The fanatic is a person with little > the exemplary fanatics. Such people are “radicalized” by over-focusing on They become radical sectarians, losing all meaningful relationship and perspective. And in case we are tempted to assume that ideological fanaticism is limited to those “Muslim crazies,” consider the current state of “uncivil war” in the United States. The “either/or” ideology of the monomaniacal conservative or the arrogance of the elitist liberal becomes prohibitive to even “seeing” the truth in/of the other, let alone finding the ability to engage them as fellow humans. Refining that thinking down further to Christian circles: > If you consider most conservative evangelicals, they do not believe that > God is a lively character and a real agent, because they’ve got God all > packaged up into sustained systematic explanations. And if you consider > character and a lively agent either, because they really believe that God > We are so easily imprisoned by our own interpretations and so convinced > ever-greater God. This was precisely the problem with Israel’s leaders in > for their own souls and minds as well as for the collective mind of Israel. In Jesus’ words, they had access to the keys to the kingdom but ignored them, and blocked others from them as well (Matthew 23:13; Luke 11:52). When this reductionism occurs today, the story we tell manifests itself as propaganda rather than theology. Please do not misunderstand us here—the fact is, because truth is so big and complex, analytical reductions are necessary if we are going to successfully negotiate the world (or communicate the gospel for that matter). However, because they are only fragments extracted from the whole, they should never be mistaken` },
      { number: 3, title: "Chapter 3: Stranded in Grey Town", slug: "03-stranded-in-grey-town", content: `order to change this impending tragic ending, he must proactively enter into the story and change it by involving himself, rather than allowing lazy indifference and empty rituals to determine him. In other words, Harold determines to live a better story. The result is seen near the end of the movie, when the narrator comments: Harold Crick became stronger in who he was, what he wanted, and why he was alive. Harold no longer ate alone. He no longer counted his toothbrush strokes. He no longer wore neckties. And, therefore, no longer worried about the time it took to put them on. He no longer counted his steps to the bus stop. Instead, Harold did that which had terrified him before. That which had eluded him Monday through Friday for so many years. That which the unrelenting lyrics of numerous punk-rock songs told him to do: Harold Crick lived his life.1 Stranger Than Fiction is the story of a man who has been asleep for most of his life and suddenly wakes to realize he has very little time left in a life he’s barely lived. He grasps hold of the reality that he has the chance to do something that is universally desired—to actually live a better story. ## A Third Reduction In so many ways this is a parable of our contemporary Christian experience. If we are honest we, as the church, have by and large failed to live the fullness of life we have been given by Jesus.2 This eclipsing of the grandeur Stranded in Grey Town 41 of truth (chapter one) and the failure to live into a Warhead-infused Story as it unfolds (chapter two) have a sad and inexorable outcome: a severely cramped existence, eking out a life as it passes by. In this chapter—as part of this first section of the book exploring various reductionisms—we want to consider how so many of God's people end up with a rather sad, attenuated, moralistic, adventure-less, and churchy spirituality by which they scrape out something of a spiritual existence. Why would any pilgrim on any trail or at any art festival have any interest in the type of reduced life that is portrayed to them by the average churchly Christian? Why do we talk about the satisfaction of eating pancakes when the Story we have been called to was described by Jesus as a “real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of” (John 10:10 MSG)? > HELL’SDOORSARELo CKEDFROMTHEINSIDE Perhaps one of the most disconcerting portrayals of the reduced life is found in The Great Divorce. This book by C. S. Lewis is not only a brilliant parable about how the dynamics of heaven and hell play out in everyday human life, but is also an outstanding example of the sheer power myth, imagination, and story have to renew life. The story is set against a backdrop of Grey Town, a rather loveless, grumpy, and alienated “place,” where the miserable inhabitants of the town—Lewis calls them the “shrunken souls of the damned” and “greasy stains on a window pane”—live increasingly insubstantial, ghost-like lives. Early in the parable we learn that Grey Town is ever-expanding because the inhabitants inevitably quarrel and are constantly moving further and further apart to get away from one another. This is a relatively easy accomplishment because, in this hell of a place, all they need to do to build a new house is to think it. Apparently, in Grey Town “you get everything you want (although of poor quality, of course) by just imagining it.” There are no constraints: the undisciplined desires of the insiders create an unreal and disordered world, well-suited to their preferences. But evil desires are at odds with joy, so that even though in some sense the damned get what they want, they are left empty and frustrated. What they want is to be happy on their own terms, but that is impossible, so strictly speaking they do not get what they want after all, even though Grey Town endlessly adapts and expands to their wishes.3 This description of Grey Town is strikingly different to Lewis’ version of heaven, where everything is available upon request but is only given on God’s terms. These substantial, authentic gifts and graces of God are in stark contrast to the flimsy, poor-quality reality of Grey Town. What if, Lewis wonders, these damned souls were permitted to ride a bus from hell toward heaven? And what if, when they got halfway there, they were met by the souls of the blessed who, arriving from heaven, try to convince them, even at this halfway point, this place of decision, to give up their sin and pride and embrace the mercy of Christ? What would they do? Astonishingly, we find that in all but one instance, the unrepentant sinners freely choose to return to hell (Grey Town) where they will carry on their ghostlike, thin existence until finally they are infinitely alienated from God, each other, and therefore ultimately from their own selves. Their rejection of grace has not only blinded them to the truth, it has robbed them of their own humanity. To borrow a phrase from The Last Battle, they are so afraid of being taken in by the saints sent to help them that they cannot be taken out of their self-imposed imprisonment and willful exile from God.4 One of the more startling aspects of The Great Divorce is that many live in hell without even knowing it. The problem is that this hellish existence passes off as normal for all those who are in it. And what is more shocking is that, according to Lewis, this would include many who claim to be believers but who refuse The Way of following Jesus. An implicit message of Lewis’ book is the implications our choices have on the direction of our life. Where we find ourselves has a lot to do with whether we choose to retreat into the alienated and reduced life (i. e. Grey Town) or venture into a larger experience of life offered to us in God. Hell is a mindset that comes about through the willful narrowing of life until what we have left is insubstantial … unreal … fractured … and hellish. “Hell is a state of mind […] And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell” (italics ours).5 Therefore Lewis warns us that: Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature.6 The key idea of The Great Divorce is that the damned are, in a real sense, successful rebels to the end; and that people actually do get to choose hell Stranded in Grey Town 43 over heaven. What Lewis is saying to us here is that hell’s doors are locked from the inside.7 It is all in the little choices we make on a daily basis, in our daily accepting or rejecting of God’s grace. Our choices and perspectives matter … hugely. There is a quality of heaven or hell in the decisions we make that determines the meaning and trajectory of our lives. Both these processes begin long before death. “The good person’s past begins to change so that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: the bad man’s past already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness.”8 And herein lies the danger of the shrunken or reduced human life—the life in Grey Town. It is this “state of mind” that we are hoping to address in the call for all people everywhere to learn what Harold Crick learned. > LIVINGCIVILIZEDINTHEUNITEDSTat ESOFGENERICA Timothy Tennent, President of Asbury Seminary and one-time missionary laments that: Our long sojourn under the spell of Christendom has also meant that we find ourselves adhering to a rather domesticated version of the gospel. One of the legacies of Christendom is that it is willing to provide a safe haven for Christianity, but only at the cost of the steady domestication of Christianity, gradually smoothing down most of its rough prophetic edges, so that Christian identity and cultural identity became virtually seamless.9 The seminal missiologist David Bosch likewise observes that, “Christianity has become nothing but the religious dimension of the culture” and “ listening to the church, society hears only the sound of its own music.”10 The problem is that contemporary Christianity is the product of the longterm, religious domestication process that has been going on for hundreds and hundreds of years. In the words of Mickey Goldmill, of the Rocky movie franchise, who gruffly tells Rocky after a defeat, “The worst thing happened that could happen to any fighter: you got civilized.”11 Asimilar fate has fallen on those of us following Jesus: we have become civilized and domesticated in both our living and telling, and in doing so the gospel itself has been likewise domesticated. Like the proverbial frog in the kettle, Western Christians are now largely unaware that they are living out a significantly reduced experience of the good news of Jesus than the one portrayed in the New Testament. ## Unca Lonny Says Lonny Davis, a zany friend of Alan’s who goes by the tag Unca Lonny, claims that most Christians experience their faith as deists. He says: Deism pretty much sums up the present state of things with regard to the faith posture of the Western world. It goes like this: God created the world, sent Jesus, gave us the Bible, and then walked away, left it up to us to work it out from there. We have to settle for a religion pretty much void of wonder, the supernatural, and an unmediated engagement with God, but we get to go to church instead. As long as we get this basic “theory” correct, and as long as we maintain a keen desire to exert moral order, we’re good to go.12 Sociologists Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton agree with Unca Lonny. In their 2005 book Soul Searching, they suggest a form of deism that has entrenched itself in our time—they call it Moralistic Therapeutic Deism (MTD).13 The research shows that MTD involves a simplistic, formulaic, and moralistic creed to which many people’s faith can be reduced. - It is moralistic in that faith is reduced to rules for a happy life—do not intentionally hurt anyone and be decent to people around you. - It is therapeutic insofar that religion is reduced to a self-help tool that is used only when needed. The goal is to live in a way that “makes you happiest.” - It is deistic because God is reduced to a removed and distant Being. It is not atheistic, as there is a creator “out there somewhere,” but this god is perceived to be somewhat indifferent to human concerns and uninvolved in the drama of life, except maybe to grant a child a wish now and then. The problem with deism is that it lacks radical openness and receptivity; it is closed to the possibility of God’s involvement in real life and history, and does not cultivate the personal vulnerability required to truly know God and be known by him. It claims to have knowledge about God—more like facts about God—while lacking any knowledge of God. It certainly has no real experience of living in a covenantal relationship with God, one that has a dynamic give and take. In other words, it is an inherently closed and codified religion. Reduced. It is rather like living a day-to-day faith akin to a carefully controlled, OCD life as a tax agent named Harold, counting toothbrush strokes` },
      { number: 5, title: "Chapter 5: Thro' Narrow Chinks in the Cavern", slug: "05-thro-narrow-chinks-in-the-cavern", content: `loss of Truth. In time, these beliefs become integrated in > prone to deny truths about ourselves and the world around us that threaten > and anybody else. The actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, a one-time atheist who > knowledge of God, concluded that being an atheist was like living in a In his compassion, God continues to ask, “Where are you?” That question—addressed to Adam and to us—is designed to awaken the person to responsibility and to lure them out of their respective system of hideouts. When we hear that question, and when we shed our alibis and try to respond, then the wall built by our callousness begins to crumble away. God is never distant from the honest and repentant heart, for the biblical God is not essentially a hidden God, but one who is always revealing himself.7 ## The Disenchanted Paradigm As we consider what it means to be human, we’d do well to note that in the New Testament, the word mind (nous, dianoia) constitutes “not an instrument of thought” but “a mode of thought” or “mind-set.” It therefore refers to the outlook, filter, orientation, or frames, as well as the rationale implicit in these. There are similarities here to the cultural imprint ideas Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 73 we explored in chapter four, but excavating the idea of “mind-set” takes us even deeper toward understanding the spiritual depth of imprints. This mind-set is “a complex of thoughts and assumptions which make up the consciousness of a person” or their “way of thinking.”8 For instance, Paul talks about the “cravings of our flesh” in Ephesians 2:3 as a way of talking about a darkened perception, and in Romans 12:2 he talks about having one’s perception cleansed, “renewing the nous.” To translate nous/dianoia as simply “mind” therefore does not fully convey the full biblical understanding. Rather, it approximates what we might generally call a worldview or paradigm; a particular set of frames used to view the world. And while paradigms allow us to see the world and negotiate it, they also come along with what is called “paradigmblindness.” By opting for one view of reality, the perceiver automatically deselects possible alternatives.9 It is this that either allows us to see—or blinds us to—what is really there. And so perhaps the most truly terrifying thing about living in a darkened cave is the paradigm—the “cave-rationality” by which it operates—the mind-set that is now suitably adjusted to the reduced reality of the hideout. The narrowed and darkened confines of the cave become the very definition of what is to be considered normal.10 Those on the inside don’t even notice, as they have simply inherited a way of seeing things and use the same rationality to escape their own existential culpability before God. We are once again reminded of Lewis’ image of hell in The Great Divorce (the name of which, incidentally, is a direct riff off the title of Blake’s poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell). However, now we discover that the problem is rooted in human consciousness itself. As we noted in chapter three, C. S. Lewis claims that, “Hell is a state of mind” and warns that, “every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell.”11 This “darkening of the nous,” might best be described as disenchantment, a darkness that has come about from a refusal to see and acknowledge this living and active God. Such disenchantment of the mind (the nous) is even more dangerous than outright revolt. In becoming disenchanted, an individual effectively silences the only inner voice that can keep their heart lively and alert as they grow older. They have stifled the voice of the child they once were. It was Jesus who said that it is only through the simple eyes of the child, the eyes that see the world through the ever-expanding frames of wonder, surprise, and imagination, that one can understand God.12 “Disenchantment therefore is as full and dense as hell itself. In this icy place, all fire from above has been extinguished. The only person who can be disenchanted is the one who has not grasped that the world is a dark marvel. Disenchantment is a sign of stupidity.”13 It is “stupidity” here because, in claiming to be wise, the disenchanted have proven themselves to be fools in the most fundamental sense of the word (Romans 1:22). Disenchantment is therefore a characteristic of the darkened prison in which all deniers of God inevitably find themselves.14 It is therefore the nous—the paradigm or door of perception—that needs to be cleansed, reoriented and reimagined so that a sense of re/ enchantment might prevail. And according to Paul it is this disenchantment that the gospel of Jesus addresses by restoring a right relationship with God (Romans 3–4), reconstituting a new humanity (Romans 5), uniting us with Christ, reorienting our lives around Jesus (Romans 6), bestowing his Spirit to lead and enlighten us (Romans 8), and granting us a new nousparadigm (Romans 12) through which we can attune ourselves to God and his purposes. God has overcome our brokenness and rebellion, has cleansed our perceptions, and has enlightened us with a comprehensive vision of reality that includes his eternal purposes for his entire cosmos (Colossians and Ephesians). Hardly a vision of the world from the confines of a cave.15 Seeing Is Believing And Believing Is Seeing “To see what is in front of one’s nose requires a constant struggle” (George Orwell).16 The story is told that when Columbus first arrived in what was to become known as the Caribbean in 1492, the indigenous people on the shore could not see Columbus’ large ships sitting on the horizon. The reason for this was that the idea of “ships” was beyond their conceptual experience, beyond their knowledge, and therefore beyond their perceived realm of possibility. They could not see what was right in front of them.17 It should be obvious simply from any experience of looking for something that was under your nose all along … Things can hide in plain sight. 18 Even when something might be right in front of us, if we do not have the proper mental slots or receptors to process what we are seeing, we fail to see at all. Limited perceptual categories mean that people will often not “see” what is directly in front of them. Eugene Webb warns that it requires great effort for a philosopher, a psychologist, or a scientist to grasp what is lacking in their own respective spheres of expertise; they are so trained in a certain way of thinking, it is almost impossible to “see” the gaps. Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 75 We’ve all experienced this when we have been so preoccupied with one thing that we fail to see something else right in front of our eyes. (Smartphone-obsessed pedestrians dawdling along the bike path, this means you.) We tend to see only what can be incorporated into our entrenched frame of reference, our already established frame, and to reject anything that doesn’t “fit.” We de/select those aspects of reality that confront our assumptions about the world and make us uncomfortable. We can only see what we believe to be possible.19 This is a warning to us all. In his book Simply Good News, N. T. Wright points out that Jesus had similar problems in proclaiming good news to his hearers; there were plenty of people who couldn’t see or receive his message because it was not what they expected or what they had been trained to see. “Jesus’s contemporaries—even his Jewish ones, and how much more his nonJewish ones!—had their heads and hearts full of wrong ideas, and he constantly ran the risk that they would hear what he was saying within the context of those wrong ideas and so twist it completely out of shape.” In fact this is a problem that runs throughout history. Jesus’ message to his contemporaries, and the church’s subsequent message about Jesus, never seems to fit what people expect. Often enough, it doesn’t even fit what the church itself expects. The good news seems to baffle its hearers because it is never what people think it ought to be. For some people, it’s so different (they were not expecting Warhead Candy) they can’t even begin to recognize it. That is why, as Paul said, the gospel is the power of God to some and foolishness to others.20 Some perceive the message as threatening and therefore become fearful of it or try to stamp it out. Wright goes on to say: How we understand things is a function of our whole personality. But if that whole personality is significantly flawed in some way—and sadly, that seems to be the case with all of us—this will affect the mental framework with which we start. It isn’t, in other words, that we are flawed human beings in other respects but our minds are clear and fully operational, just waiting like a blank sheet of paper for someone to write true ideas on them. Our minds, which are intimately connected with our imaginations, our emotions, and our physical bodies in a rich and multitextured combination, need to be sorted out just like the rest of us. If we insist on keeping our mental, emotional, and imaginative world the way it’s always been, the good news just won’t fit. We will then either reject it or distort it, cutting off the bits we can’t fit in or reshaping parts to conform to the ideas we already have.21 And so it is our whole mind-set, our whole way of seeing that needs to be cleansed in order to receive the good news. Jesus was so challenging to many of his hearers because he constantly pushed them to see things differently. He wasn’t giving new or more detailed answers to questions they were already asking. He was doing and saying things designed to tease his hearers into facing new and dangerous questions, into looking at familiar ideas (such as the kingdom of God) from new and unexpected angles. Most people, then and now, find that disturbing and try to avoid it.22 > As long-term inmates of our respective dungeon-hideouts, we really do not > see reality as it is, which leads to a delusional understanding of the human > condition.

It is noteworthy that the New Testament word for truth (aleitheia) literally means unveiling, unconcealment, disclosedness, and so the concept is implied in the revelation of truth itself.24 The writers of Scripture often use the imagery/ metaphor of unveiling when it comes to the knowledge of God and to various theophanies. For instance, Paul refers to it in 2 Corinthians 3:13– 18: “Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed” (2 Corinthians 3:15–16 NRSV); it is mentioned throughout the writings of the Old Testament prophets, including in the vision of the Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37), where God unveils Ezekiel’s eyes to see what he was calling Israel toward; and, of course, we see it in the tearing of the temple veil at the death of Jesus, with all its associated symbolism.

What if Christianity was never meant to be simple?11 Krish Kandiah’s book Paradoxology makes a bold claim: that the paradoxes that at first sight appear to undermine belief are actually vital to a vibrant faith, and that it is only by continually wrestling with them—rather than trying to pin them down or resolve them one way or another—that we can really worship God, individually and corporately. When paradox is surrendered, then we end up with the unbelieving doubt of a person who cannot permit his or her mind to be blown, or the sloppy sentimentality of liberal ideology and religion, or just the plain old grumpy fundamentalism of conservatives who like things to be black or white. > JUSTWIGGLEYo URSHOULDERSLIKETHIS I (Alan) was recently in an art gallery exhibiting a number of the twentiethcentury artist Wassily Kandinsky’s paintings. I love Kandinsky’s art because in many of his paintings he claims he was actually trying to paint music, to visualize what he was hearing. Think about that for a moment. In a recording of an interview with the artist, he advised that, in order to understand his paintings (and in fact all abstract art), one has to take Jesus’ advice to become like children very seriously indeed. One has to look at the paintings with the simple and innocent eyes of a child and, in doing so, re-educate one’s eyes in the art of seeing.12 Children are naturally humble (as well as playful) when it comes to acquiring knowledge; they are always deep in learning mode, always accepting they have more to learn. This is why Jesus says we must change and become like children to be able to enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 18:3–4). J. M. Barrie, famous for writing Peter Pan in 1904, encouraged adults to see the world through the eyes of the child, and, in doing so, brought about a re-education of sight. The 2004 movie Finding Neverland depicts Barrie bringing Peter Pan to life on the stage of the West End in London.13 Before the premiere, conflict arises as the producer (i. e. “the money” behind the show) is extremely skeptical that the story will appeal to his upper-class theatre patrons. On opening night, Barrie reserves twenty-five seats, scattered around the theatre, for children from a nearby orphanage. Of course, the children are instantly drawn in to the show, regardless of the elegant surroundings and the stodgy theatre goers on either side of them. As the appropriate amount of pixie dust is sprinkled on the actors, and as the instructions are given to “just wiggle your shoulders like this and let go,” even the most curmudgeonly of adults, when seated next to a child, begin to see with new eyes, and so enter into the world of Neverland. The obvious question for each of us to consider is, can we approach God with a similar innocence and joy? For it will be the playful, unprejudiced, humble, and curious who will be able to make sense of the God who is beyond our wildest imagination, and who will begin to pursue wholeness in ways that bring about meaning and purpose. It was the childlike eyes of the early church Fathers and Mothers that meant they were able to plumb the depths of beauty, goodness, and truth of God in the way that they did. Like children, they had unprejudiced, humble, and curious eyes of wonder.14 And this childlike reverence and awe is a prerequisite for grasping mysterious truth. The quantum physicist Max Planck eulogizes childlike thinking in contributing to advances in the area of science: The feeling of wonderment is the source and inexhaustible fountainhead of [the child’s] desire for knowledge. It drives the child irresistibly on to solve the mystery, and if in his attempt he encounters a causal relationship, he will not tire of repeating the same experiment ten times, a hundred times, in order to taste the thrill of discovery over and over again. The reason why the adult no longer wonders is not because he has solved the riddle of life, but because he has grown accustomed to the laws governing his world picture […] He who does not comprehend this situation, misconstrues its profound significance, and he who has reached the stage where he no longer wonders about anything, merely demonstrates that he has lost the art of reflective reasoning.15 As we noted in chapter two, God is both above and beyond all things (transcendent), and yet as Creator he is also within all things (immanent). We therefore need to widen the doors of our perception in an attempt to take it all in. In doing so, we are able to discern the presence of God in everything that he has made. We will thereby discover that “the whole universe is a cosmic Burning Bush filled with the divine Fire yet not consumed.”16 Or, as poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning noted, > Earth’s crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God; > But only he who sees, takes off his shoes, > The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries, ## Blake hints that a way forward is: > To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower > Hold I nfinity in the palm of your hand > And Eternity in an hour18 > to be everywhere … infinite. It’s all in the seeing! William Blake (echoing > some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands > To live in God’s world is to have a willingness to see and experience the > our primary vision.20 Episcopalian priest Barbara Brown Taylor recounts I could no longer see myself or the least detail of my life in the same way again. When the service was over that day I walked out of it into a Godenchanted world, where I could not wait to find further clues to heaven on earth. Every leaf, every ant, every shiny rock called out to me—begging to be watched, to be listened to, to be handled and examined. I became a detective of divinity, collecting evidence of God’s genius and admiring the tracks left for me to follow: locusts shedding their hard bodies for soft, new, winged ones; prickly pods of milkweed spilling silky white hair; lightning spinning webs of cold fire in the sky, as intricate as the veins in my own wrist. My friend taught me to believe that these were all words in the language of God, hieroglyphs given to puzzle and I could no longer see myself or the least detail of my life in the same way again.21 Ben (a friend of Alan’s) once had a teaching role where he had to play a mad scientist in order to introduce kindergarten children to the wonders of science. At one point he was trying to explain to a group of children how magnets worked. One child kept saying that Ben was all wrong, insisting instead that they worked by “magic.” Ben again attempted to explain the scientific nature of magnetic fields and their intricacies, to which the young girl responded, “Yeah, that’s magic!” Ben had to agree. Sometimes you just have to wiggle your shoulders like this and let go... > ALway SYEARNING, ALway SLEARNING In his 1952 groundbreaking book, Your God Is Too Small, J. B. Phillips calls on Christians to reframe their understanding of God by embarking on a personal search for a more meaningful concept of him.22 Phillips felt then, as we do now: the trouble facing us today is that we do not have a god big enough to help us make any real sense of our world, a world where our experience of life has grown in myriad directions and our mental horizons have been expanded to the point of utter bewilderment by world events and scientific discoveries. Our inherited maps no longer fit the territories. In fact, although we live in this incredibly complex, ever-evolving world, our ideas of God have remained largely static and formulaic for many centuries. Phillips wrote from a deep conviction that if it is really true—that there is a God who is in charge of the whole cosmos, of human history, as well as the mysteries of life and death—then we can hardly escape a sense of futility and frustration until we begin to see what he is like and what his purposes are. We all need to expand our vision of who God is. The very fact that it is God with whom we engage means that we should always expect to be expanded while being reframed—in other words it means that we should expect to have our minds blown every time. Consider the inconceivable size and scale of the universe itself; then consider that the Being we call “God” is the Being who created this infinite space with words. He spoke everything into existence … from nothing to something … just like that! How do you get your mind around that?! If we were to similarly recast God’s love and grace in a wi-l]der frame, then consider how, in the Incarnation, the eternal, all-knowing, mindblowing God emptied himself and entered fully into the very limited human experience of a servant, enduring the depths of darkness and sin on our behalf in and through the cross (Philippians 2). We must ask ourselves, why would this Eternal Being do this for me/us? And the only possible answer to this is … inconceivable love and grace, the kind which, once again, blows any normal sense of ratio and scale that we might possess. This is the grace of God in a wi-l]der frame. Consider Nicodemus in John 3. He seemed to be similarly overwhelmed during his interactions with Jesus, late one evening in the dark of night. “How can this be?” he responds, when Jesus tells him he must be born again if he is to see the kingdom of God. Perhaps Nicodemus was beginning to realize that the very small world he had been inhabiting was not the reality he had always believed it was. Jesus was blowing the doors off his small-minded religious tendency to tweak a few laws here and there, and instead was calling him to new birth. Any encounter with Jesus requires the same. Any time we truly contemplate who Jesus is must surely blow our minds. His call to us is always to more. To a bigger God. Abigger story. Abigger life. It really doesn’t matter if all this feels somewhat overwhelming. Actually, the point is that one ought to feel overwhelmed when dealing with the Infinite and the Eternal.23 The unquenchable sense of yearning for God does not come to a halt even at the end of all things, when all creatures are brought face-to-face with > God. Genuine longing can never tire of looking at the beloved. Augustine > uses the term “insatiable satisfaction” to express this “ever-moreness.”24 > In seeing the Face that surpasses all desire, “we will be insatiably satisfied, > filled.”25 “We will have attuned the ear for that Voice,” which, once heard, > When God sends his own living Word to his creatures, he does so not to > their deepest needs and yearnings. Rather he communicates and actively > awestruck by a love which he could never have hoped to experience.27 ## Learn More, Understand Less One of the things we lament in contemporary expressions of Christianity is that we have failed to really inculcate a love of learning, a culture of deep and searching theology, especially one that rests comfortably in the ineffable mysteries of God. Where in our faith communities are we providing opportunities for this to happen, alongside each other? Where are we allowing the "Jacobs" in our churches to cross the Jabbok River and wrestle their faith out with God? Where does one come across groups like the Inklings (those who regularly share` },

      { number: 1, title: "Introduction", slug: "00-introduction", content: `her very wings had grown balder and balder. Horrified, she remembered how, slowly, imperceptibly, day by day, it had been getting harder and harder to fly, and how she had told herself it was no matter. She could always stop before it was too late. Now suddenly here she was, trapped on the ground. She looked up and saw the merchant looking at her. Was that a small, sly grin spreading across his face? He grabbed the now helpless bird, put her in a cage, and walked away laughing.^1 ## The Cage of a Thousand Compromises We start with this parable because, like all bargains with the devil, it mirrors so many processes that make up human life and, for the purposes of this book, the nature of the Christian walk gone wrong. Tragically, like the formerly wild skylark, little by little we give up our freedoms in Christ, only to end up in a cage made of a thousand little compromises. This of course need not be so. When we try to take shortcuts to costly discipleship, we end up with a domesticated existence that is far from the liberated, untamed life Jesus calls us to. Much of what we write here is about exposing some of the personal and cultural issues, and the idolatry so often associated with them, that in the end undermine our capacity to experience full, Christlike lives. If some of what is set forth in these pages seems strange to us, then it might well be because we have become too domesticated, accustomed to being featherless, and have now lost the art of flight. Perhaps it is because we have forgotten what it really means to follow the untamed, revolutionary Jesus. We must now remember in order to reactivate the journey. In your hands is a book on what we call “missional discipleship.” In many ways it contains ideas and a call to live a lifestyle that should be normative for Jesus’s people. But we know all too well from personal experience and observation that following Jesus doesn’t always come easy. And being involved in various expressions of missional Christianity has given us an appreciation for just how hard it is to be consistent followers of our Lord and Savior. To be a truly radical disciple does require a relentless evaluation of life’s priorities and concerns, together with an ongoing, rigorous critique of our culture, to ensure we are not adopting values that subvert the very life and message we are called to live out. We sincerely believe discipleship has become a frontier issue for the people of God at this time in history. In C. S. Lewis's words, "Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one—the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts."^2 North America is a vestige of the original [Christian] movement, an institutional expression of religion that is in part a civil religion and in part a club where religious people can hang out with other people whose politics, worldview, and lifestyle match theirs.^3 If this is indeed the case, we should be clear this is not what the church is called to be, and is, in fact, a failure in discipleship. And it must be addressed if we are to give faithful witness to our century. Therefore, rediscovering what it means to radically follow Jesus is an area of strategic, missional concern. The gospel is the power of God for the salvation of the world (Rom. 1:16), and God wants to redeem the broken and lost world around us. He has chosen to do this through us. Our lives, individual and corporate, play a vital role in the unfolding of the grand purposes of God. More is at stake in discipleship than our own personal salvation. The gospel cannot be limited to being about my personal healing and wholeness, but rather extends in and through my salvation to the salvation of the world. To fail in discipleship and disciple making is therefore to fail in the primary mission (or "sent-ness") of the church. And it does not take a genius to realize that we have all but lost the art of disciple making in the contemporary Western church. ## The Structure of Untamed We have divided the book into four sections. Following our approach of removing impediments to discipleship, we have identified three areas where problems in discipleship locate themselves: theology, culture, and personal issues. - Section One: Untaming (Our Idea of) God The church has always believed that our most fundamental problems in discipleship have their roots in faulty views of God. If not properly addressed, these distorted views deeply impact our effectiveness as disciples and missionaries in our world. The first section therefore will look at some foundational theological issues related to our understanding of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Although we have tried to write this in a very accessible manner, some readers might find this section somewhat abstract and feel impatient to get to the "practical" issues. But nothing is more important than a right perception and experience of God. So, our advice is to slow down, and seriously examine your heart and engage your mind here. In probing issues relating to God, it is hard to avoid dealing with concepts in one form or another. - Section Two: Untaming Our Culture Culture is the context we all swim in. We can't help but be deeply informed by it at every level of our human life—individual as well as social. Culture is a complex jungle of ideas, history, language, religious views, economic systems, political issues, and the like. Culture forms the basic way in which human beings communicate and share life and meaning together. But not all of it fits nicely with reality as God defines it. The problem is that most of us are unaware of these issues because we simply assume that our culture is right. If we are not careful, then, the culture rather than God actually gets to define reality. This section will explore the power of money and status, our understanding of the family, and (yes) the church. We put issues of church here because the church, as a human agency, must always express faith culturally. But it is often more conditioned by culture than it is by the gospel. For instance, how does the culture of consumerism affect our experience of the church? Is the church challenging society here, or are we being co-opted to a larger cultural agenda? - Section Three: Untaming the Self On a more distinctly personal level, there are numerous obstacles to discipleship that are part of our own scripting (or software) as individuals. While theology and culture do impact us personally, the issues explored here are felt within our own psyches. How we understand who we are (self-image) and how we understand sexuality has everything to do with how we follow Jesus and engage the world. We cannot avoid these issues. - Section Four: Untaming the Mission As people captivated by the incarnation, we couldn't finish the book without suggesting some practical ways of implementing untamed discipleship based on the life of Jesus. And so the final chapter is exactly that: a simple guide to incarnational mission. This chapter, based on six principles of incarnational living, includes a number of examples of individuals and communities doing just that in their local contexts. Nothing too heady, just some simple clues to going deep into culture based on the life and example of Jesus. ## Practices and Group Discussions At the end of every chapter is a set of practices along with some questions for group discussion. The practices are designed to be suggestions the reader can adopt in order to activate a more untamed version of following Jesus. By applying them you can act your way into a new way of thinking. As for the group discussion, we really do believe that community is the best context for discipleship and the right place for accountability and the pursuit of truth. Don't do this alone. ## Signature Themes If the book is structured around theology, culture, psychology, and mission (in that order), the reader will also discern that consistent themes pervade the entire book. Each chapter is spiced with four distinctive motifs or themes that, taken together, will create a certain vibe, or atmosphere, in the book. They are... ## Jesus-shaped discipleship It seems crazy to say it, but the first thing we can say about missional discipleship is that it must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had/has for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples. Every single aspect of the way we live out our lives needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. A dynamic, vital, living reality and response to Jesus in every moment of our lives is our most fundamental truth, and we have forgotten it to our great peril. N. T. Wright notably states that the longer you look at Jesus, the more you will want to serve him—that is, of course, if it is the real Jesus you are looking at.4 Because Jesus defines our concepts of God, getting it wrong here means getting it wrong everywhere (as we shall see in chapters 1 and 2). And because Jesus defines and models for us a perfected humanity, he shows us the way of true holiness. ## Shema spirituality The Shema (Deut. 6:4–9) is considered the most important confession in the Old Testament and in Judaism, and is confessed three times a day by every orthodox Jew. The word shema itself stems from the first word of this text and simply means “listen!” or “take heed.” “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” But its defining influence extends through the New Testament to each one of us. > One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'H ear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'L ove your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these." Jesus explicitly places the Shema at the epicenter of what it means to be a true disciple—to love God, to love others, and to live this out authentically in God's world. We believe that we must simply take Jesus at face value here; he is saying that "Shema spirituality" is core to the outworking of our discipleship—our life under God. Actually, when we look into this, there are thoroughly good reasons for it. We suggest that Shema spirituality helps us do the following: - Rediscover the true nature of worship (we must love one God, not many—no idols and images, please) - Learn what it means to love God in and through the whole of life (with intellect, passion, family, culture, money, sexuality, and so on) - Understand our relationship to the world and our obligation to "the other" (we can never come to a true discipleship in isolation from the love of people) - Recover an authentically monotheistic worldview, out of which we can rightly interpret our world (operating with a unified worldview around the kingship of God) Loving the one true God with all that we are, and loving others as ourselves, is as simple as it is profound. We have discovered that this core truth can indeed provide the answer to the obstacles we encounter on the road. In its simple but profound summation of the law and prophets, we find something of an antidote to the various forms of deceptive` },
      { number: 2, title: "Chapter 2: Your God Is Too Sick", slug: "02-your-god-is-too-sick", content: `well as the momentous parting words of commission under which we live (Matt. 28:18–20). As C. S. Lewis says, “Obedience is the ‘holy courtesy’ required for entering into the divine relationship.”15 In the Bible, the real test of what you know is how you live your faith. S Think of Christians whom you admire, and you can be sure they are not simply devout people who got their theology or devotional lives right, but rather people who actually did something significant in their worlds. We think of St. Patrick, Martin Luther, John Wesley, William Booth, Corrie ten Boom, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Mother Teresa, Jackie Pullinger, as well as countless other known and anonymous saints who have made a difference in their own unique ways. ## Thinking thoughts after God With our hearts open to God, and a commitment to obey, it’s time to seriously engage God with our minds. I ntellectual laziness is simply not an option for disciples. This doesn’t mean that God expects all of us to be intellectual giants, but he does require that we love him with our minds. As the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley rightly said, “The mind becomes that which it contemplates.” This has both negative your god is too sick and positive consequences, for if we think about nothing, our minds become nothing. But if we think thoughts after God, we become more like him. Besides, for many it can be a pathetic and dangerous cop-out to just “feel” God in worship and prayer—this is necessary but not sufficient for a fully fledged Shema spirituality. T ## A Mature Community To be mature disciples, we need to engage with knowing and loving God on all three levels: our minds, our hearts, and our actions. And because we are all wired differently, we will tend to prefer one over the other, which is why real knowledge of God reached at in the context of the community of faith where people can learn from one another. The activists learn from the theologians, who learn from the pastors, and so on. This way we can complement each other’s strengths and compensate for the more underdeveloped areas. The local and broader church community also provides for us a form of accountability, where we can measure our “knowledge of God” against historical witness as well as that of other brothers and sisters. We do not arrive at truth alone. ## Another One Bites the Dust Leading a community of faith for over fifteen years has not only been a great privilege and an incredibly enriching experience, but at times it has been a source of great anxiety and heartbreak. One of the sources of heartbreak is to look back and see how many have left the way of discipleship. It's like The Pilgrim's Progress gone wrong—where way too many are not pilgrims and so they do not progress. Sadly, our experience has seemed to correlate more with the parable of the sower (Matt. 13:1–23), where only one in four remains faithful and becomes fruitful in the end! Many of these friends have redefined Christian discipleship to suit their respective lifestyles, or have reframed God in some way, or have simply ditched the faith altogether—and in so doing have sold their feathers for worms, only to have lost the capacity to fly. Much of this book is an exposition of the inner dynamics of the parable of the sower, or, to return to our parable of the skylark, of why so many sell their feathers. People leave the path for reasons such as spiritual shallowness, status anxiety, pursuit of wealth, fear of persecution, or because of many other, sometimes even demonic, anti-discipleship forces that are at work in our world. Dealing with the complex, sexually charged (often in a very broken way) community at South that emerged largely from fringy, non-Christian backgrounds has forced us to come to grips with the actual motives of why people choose to leave the path of following Jesus. We think we are given a vital clue in Ezekiel 14, where Ezekiel narrates the situation of some of the elders of Israel coming to him to get a prophecy. At this point he is given an insight into the nature of their inquiring. God says to him: > Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and > put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let > them inquire of me at all? Therefore speak to them and tell > raelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling > will answer him myself in keeping with his great idolatry.” > In verse 7 he continues, “When any Israelite or any alien > your god is too sick > face and then goes to a [false] prophet to inquire of me, I the > is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the Lord have enticed that It appears that what is being said here is if someone is pre-committed to falsity and will not pursue God with pure heart and motives, they will hear only what they want to hear. (We do well to remember that it is only the pure in heart that will see God [Matt. 5:8].) The horrifying result of impure motives is that people sincerely believe it is God who has spoken, when all along it was their own lying hearts! Isaiah agrees when he utters this chilling warning: Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God. But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. But this is what you shall receive from my hand: You will lie down in torment. (Isa. 50:10–11) When we deliberately turn our hearts from the love of truth and redefine it to suit ourselves, we will experience the anguish of our choices. God's truth can be for me a guiding light, something that gives me direction, only if it has been revealed to me in my encounter with God—not if I have somehow selected it for myself from among many existing options. The heresy in this act is nothing other than the clinging to a particular thought or idea simply because it is one's own. And the result is, as Charles Williams wrote, "the disintegration of the intellect, the justification to oneself of error and evil."^17 In Romans, Paul draws directly on this prophetic understanding of idolatry in his sharp (and always current) exposé on the inner nature of unbelief. He reminds us that although all can discern God, they suppress this knowledge (and therefore their conscience) in order that they might engage in immorality (1:18). He ends up describing well the dark sides of twenty-firstrst-century culture. T This “handing over” is what is The Hall of Mirrors meant in both Ezekiel’s as well “In normal circumstances people as Isaiah’s prophecies above. The who turn their backs on reality are judgment we receive is this: as soon set straight by the mockery we ignore God, we are handed and criticism of those around them, over to our sins, to ungodly rawhich makes them aware they have tionalizations, and ultimately to lost credibility.

It requires real integtimes over.” rity (purity of heart) to stay true —The testimony of Albert Speer, to God and self in this way. The one of Hitler’s henchmen Christian community is called to walk in this light. Abiblical spirituality collapses when we refuse to walk in the light of the God revealed in Jesus, and thereby fail to have fellowship with one another (1 John 1:5–10). Truth, and the disciple’s commitment to truth no matter what, plays a vital role in keeping us walking in the way of Jesus (2 Thess. 2:9–10). And to do this we must constantly, your god is too sick as well as comprehensively, repent of our idolatry! (See Ezek. 14:6; 1 Thess. 1:9.) Here are a few ways we idolatrously attempt to redefine God and confine discipleship. ## Theology of the little head We hope the reader will excuse the slightly risqué heading, but we believe this humorous little phrase captures the very point we want to make here. Again, this comes from tons of experience with sexually charged young adults of both the heterosexual and the homosexual variety. We once heard Tony Campolo tell of a time when he was head of the department in a secular university. Being Tony Campolo, he was well-known as a follower of Jesus and became something of a mentor to many Christian students on the campus who would seek his advice on various issues they were facing. He tells a story of a young man he was mentoring who, after six months of being at the university, declared that he now had significant intellectual problems with his faith. As a result, he was undergoing a serious existential crisis. Tony wryly asked the question, "When did you start sleeping with your girlfriend?" The student, now somewhat taken aback, asked why this had anything to do with his deep existential crisis, but eventually confessed that he had started having sex with his girlfriend two months prior to this conversation. T Psychology has a great name for this—it's called cognitive dissonance. It occurs when a person's beliefs, knowledge, and values clash with persuasive information that calls them into question. This inconsistency causes psychological discomfort, and the mind adjusts to reduce the discrepancy. In ethics, cognitive dissonance is important because of its ability to alter values. This squares completely with our pastoral experience. Almost every time someone comes to us saying that they suddenly have serious intellectual problems with God, the real issue is that they are having sex with someone—or want to and are working themselves up to it! They have begun thinking with the little head and not with their big head. And the penis, as it has often been noted, is not known for its conscience! Although this metaphor is distinctly masculine, the exact same sexual motive lies behind the sins of many women who claim the same issues. The reality is that disciples sometimes have to obey God simply because of the joy of doing God’s will—even, and perhaps especially, when this runs up against the dictates of our passions and desire. If we wish to preserve the life-giving connection with God, we must learn the discipline of obedience to God in a world that will reward us for waywardness. your god is too sick Our love of God, and hence our discipleship, is at stake in our choices, so we need to beware. We “do not fail in obedience through lack of love, but have lost love because [we] have not attempted obedience.”21 ## Adishonest buck People can lose integrity and focus when it comes to money. One of the clearest religious examples of this is seen in the so-called prosperity doctrine. The great danger in this prosperity doctrine is that it is almost true.22 This is what makes it an even more insidious error, because there is enough truth in it to allow us to legitimize it with some “shonky” theology.

This is strange, because the initial founder, missiologist Donald Mc Gavran, was a movement thinker, while later theorists (Win Arn, C. Peter Wagner) were more technical, managerial, sociological, and marketing people — which allowed the movement to lean into technocracy. Missional-incarnational churches (mid-twentieth Grassroots, Arising in the middle to late twentieth century, century – missional, the missional paradigm (which places mission present) movemental as the organizing principle of church) begins to completely reframe ecclesiology around missiology. When missional ideas are informed by incarnational approaches, a distinctly grassroots perspective of the church is birthed. But in many cases these lack organization and structure and therefore are problematic to maintain over periods of time. Transformative movements do require a vision and translocal structure, which the grassroots movement resists. On the other hand, when missional ideas fail to embrace incarnational approach together with a movement ethos, it tends to become a rather boring technical theological discussion mainly in mainline Protestant Christianity, which is very institutional and lacks the theological funding and energy to be able to produce missional movement. - Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms Multisite megachurches (2000 – Structural, Essentially, this was the logical extension of present) movemental the successful megachurch movement of the eighties and nineties that was birthed in the evangelistically driven church-growth movement. The idea of multisites was motivated largely by the desire to extend the megachurch’s impact and maximize on resources through developing a regional approach to church. As such, it’s a more institutional, somewhat inorganic and top-down attempt to reproduce churches. What it misses is the dynamic of bottom-up people-movements. But because multisite thinking involved the desire to reproduce churches, its key practitioners began to probe the missional math of multiplication. They are already committed to multiplication; the logic leads them to people-movements. Reproducing churches, church-planting movements (CPMs) (1990 – present) Movemental, Here is where the prevailing, more strucstructural tural model of the multisites really begins to think and act movementally. Church planting becomes a major thrust, but it still tends to reproduce more institutional forms. Most church planting here is simply an attempt to reproduce the contemporary megachurch model. At this stage, it has yet to seriously engage incarnational-mission ideas. But the desire for exponential viral growth begs the question of reproducibility and what we call movementum. To become truly exponential, churches have to significantly de-professionalize the ministry, simplify ecclesiology, and activate the whole people of God. continued... > Ecclesial Primary Description Shifts Paradigms Apostolic movements/Verge churches (2000 – Movemental, Verge churches are essentially reproducing present) missional, churches that are now beginning to reframe structural, church around the missional/apostolic function grassroots (not just evangelistic) and are beginning to restructure and organize toward exponential movement. Even grassroots dimensions are being factored into the equation as churches seek to empower all believers as agents of the King. Verge church thinks and acts like a translocal/regional movement. Micro and macro forms of church are employed in the process. The big difference between this and the missional-incarnational is that, true to its inclusive both/and approach, it’s much more organized and includes hybrid forms of organization. At the risk of oversimplifying what we have said above, we can say that the paradigm, or systems story, of the vast majority of churches in the West (contemporary and/or historical) has been primarily an institutional one. In Verge church thinking, we must recognize it’s precisely this central paradigm that must be dislodged if we are going to become a viral gospel movement in our day. It is our belief that it’s the overwhelming predominance of the institutional imagination — the Constantinian captivity of the church, so to speak — that is keeping us from becoming genuinely missional as well as exponential. We can picture it as in figures 1 and 2. Catholic Reformational Christendom Christendom institutional paradigm contemporary church church growth ## Figure 1 New Testament and grassroots renewal early church movements movemental paradigm missional-incarnational Verge churches/apostolic movements movements ## Figure 2 ## Verging the Church: Key Themes The idea of pivotal design is where something that is invented or designed becomes the base design in all subsequent technologies. For instance, the airfoil designed by the Wright brothers is still the base design in all aircraft. The transistor is another example. Or even closer to the idea of movements, the Twelve-Step program; many different interpretations and applications, but the principles remain the same. All further developments build off the base one. We believe that Verge churches — or what we hope will become apostolic movements — might well provide us with one of the pivotal designs for the church in the twenty-first century and beyond.11 But in order to comprehend and apply the “new technology” of apostolic movements, we are going to have to do a lot of reframing our thinking and practice. Throughout thebook, the reader will find we are moving from more distinctly conceptual material to that which is more concrete and practical. There is simply no way around having to do the conceptual spadework; if we wish to birth apostolic movements in our day, we cannot avoid the intellectual rigor of rethinking the paradigm, recalibrating the system, changing the metaphor, and reframing the story of church. But you will find that all the way through there are practical handles, tips, and checklists to facilitate application of what is being said. ## You Gotta Move It, Move It We insist that a genuinely apostolic paradigm of the church is by nature inclusive of all forms in ser vice of its mission, whereas the more institutional paradigm is by nature exclusive, demanding high conformity. So we fully recognize, with the writers of The Starfish and the Spider, that all organizations are really hybrids of both centralized and decentralized forms of organization.12 And while it’s highly unlikely many of the prevailing forms of church in the West can become pure people-movements, we believe that the future viability and growth of the church requires that we have to move more and more toward embracing the forms we call apostolic movements. We say this because (as we have seen) what has gotten us here will not get us there, but also because it’s clear from church history that movements are our best and most effective expressions of ecclesia. Not only is it our most primal story — the New Testament church was clearly an apostolic movement — but also throughout history it appears we're at our very best when we have little or nothing of what we think constitutes the church institution. Multiplication + Church Planting + Mission of All People Everywhere = Apostolic Movement Looking at the early church, the Celtic movement, the Moravian movement, contemporary China, India, and so on, we are at our transformative best as decentralized movements, and we grow faster that way than we ever can with all the institutional accoutrements of church. The church Jesus designed is a movement and not a religious institution. If this isn’t the case, then there’s no way to understand why Jesus reserves his harshest criticisms not for the so-called sinners but rather for the religious people of his day. It also explains why he chose and empowered ordinary people and not the religious elite to take the gospel to the world. This isn’t to say God doesn’t like order or that there’s no structure to movements; it is to say the original church structure is very unlike the kind of structures that emerged with the Christendom form of church. We aren’t saying God hasn’t or doesn’t use all expressions of church — clearly he does. We are not even saying that a certain level of institution is not actually necessary to maintain longevity; it is. What we are saying is that we can all do it a whole lot better, and with more theological integrity, by activating an apostolic imagination and by developing movemental forms of the church. ### Discarding Either/Or, Embracing Both/And We have shared this vision of Future Travelers and this book with our grassroots missional friends, and a common response has been, "It can't be done." We also have spent time with leaders of large established churches who shake their heads in pessimism. The truth is that both groups, being purists, are captive to the limits of their own acquired (somewhat prejudicial) thinking and are blinded to the possibilities of seeing the church become more. The problem is that for the vast majority of churches and Christians, this oppositional thinking has blocked our capacities to discern a way forward. It also implies that the only way forward for the established church is to close up shop and start again from the ground up. It is a counsel of despair for the established church and signals increasing marginalization from the mainstream for the missional movement as it now exists. Part of the problem with this is because, to use business consultant Jim Collins’ terms, they fail to embrace the genius of the and. Both groups are locked into the trap of either/or thinking. Seen from the perspective of either/or, these forms of church are irreconcilable, but reconceived from the perspective of the both/and, the supposed clash of imaginations begins to fade away. Collins rightly says that a truly visionary organization “embraces continuity and change, conservatism and progressiveness, stability and revolution, predictability and chaos, heritage and renewal, fundamentals and craziness. And, and, and.”13 In moving forward and engaging the issues we face, we have no doubt this must be the case. I (Alan) admit that in my own early days as a church planter, leadership developer, and missional strategist for my denomination, I was much more inclined to this oppositional kind of thinking. The breakthrough happened for me in researching for The Forgotten Ways, when I came to the astonishing realization that every church, incarnational and attractional and everything in between, already has the full potential of Apostolic Genius resident in it, and all that is needed is for us to reactivate it.14 This is a very powerful idea you should ponder for a while, because if it’s true — and I am convinced it is — then it changes everything. > We'll spend time later on the process of reactivation, but we mention it here simply to suggest that every church, indeed every believer, has the full capacity for world transformation within, and when we activate it, it changes everything. But we have to be able to see it first. And, if we are willing, then we will find that the missional and the established forms are not mutually exclusive, because our core ecclesiology not only allows for but also champions both approaches. But let us be clear: we believe church can be attractional and missional at the same time only if the organizational genetics, our core ideas, the paradigmatic brain at the center, legitimizes both impulses as important and justifiable expressions of what it means to contextualize the gospel in the Western world. It is this victory on the level of imagination — of our vision of the church as Jesus designed it to be — that makes a Verge church a real live possibility. This` },

This is not to say that institutional structures are all bad; certainly, their intent is almost always good. Even so, concretized institutionalization does tend to block some of the most powerful aspects of ecclesia as Jesus intended it: a potent social force and gospel phenomenon that sweeps through populations. Any reading of history, Christian or otherwise, shows us that institutional religion can become repressive, stifling creative expression. One of the most fundamental reboots we need to do in our day is to rediscover ourselves as the same potent, transforming people-movement that started with Jesus and went on to change the world. The institutional forms have gotten us where we are now and can’t take us much farther. We need to become a people-movement again. We need to take the New Testament’s meaning of ecclesia/church again with utmost seriousness. I’m more and more convinced this word contains the full meaning of what we are trying to articulate about apostolic movement. Ecclesia in the Bible doesn’t refer to some building or religious institution (no scholar would argue otherwise); rather it was borrowed from the process of Roman city assemblies — it means “gathering.” But even more significant, as far as I can determine, ecclesia has four distinct levels: 1. Ecclesia as the people of God expressing the ministry of Christ in every sphere and domain 2. Ecclesia as the local church 3. Ecclesia as the citywide church 4. Ecclesia as the universal church The term applies at every level of expression and organization! In other words, ecclesia is movement! We’ve allowed this big word to come to mean something profoundly different than what it originally meant — we have had a nasty case of long-term paradigm blindness, and it’s time to move. What we now have are somewhat inflexible, backward-looking, often fearful and defensive forms of church. What we need are missionally responsive, culturally adaptive, organizationally agile multiplication movements. Verge churches — because they are apostolic movements — mobilize the whole people of God, are reproducing and reproducible, are structurally agile networked (avoiding centralization of power and function), and employ missional leadership and ministry modes. Both Dave and I have no doubt that if there is to be any advancing of the Western church in the twenty-first century, it will be marked by the recovery of the apostolic movement form of church. In fact, we suggest that if we fail to somehow rediscover this mode of church, we may eventually lose all significant cultural impact and become a footnote to Western history. In the final section of this book, we will present a detailed approach to what it means to activate movements, but at the very least: - Movements mobilize the whole people of God. The real revolution comes when all the people of God get to embrace their Godgiven destiny as active agents of the King. Surely, one of the most potent ecclesial doctrines in the New Testament is the priesthood of all believers, yet it’s one we’ve seldom lived out. Clergy and professionals can be control freaks. We need to recognize that Jesus is well able to lead his people and doesn’t require professionals to keep us on track! - Movements are reproducing and reproducible. In truth, much of what we do as church is unwieldy and very hard to reproduce — largely because of our captivity to institutional forms. In contrast, exponential missional movements thrive on rapid and spontaneous expansion and can be achieved by all agents in the system. That’s why they’re able to achieve what Roland Allen calls “spontaneous expansion.” To say it another way, reproduction necessitates “reproduce-ability,” and reproducibility requires an ecclesiology simple enough for any disciple to reproduce. The church Jesus designed, the one in the pages of the New Testament, is precisely that: a grassroots people-movement with a vision for the transformation of society, operating as a decentralized network, spreading like a virus, and profoundly reproducible by every active agent in the system. Verge churches must be willing to reconceive themselves as people-movements. They can no longer simply see themselves, through an institutional lens, as “churches”; rather they must see themselves as embryonic movements in the making. (In other words, they must become ecclesia!) When we are willing to see that every believer can be a church planter and every church can be a church-planting church, then we will reorganize to make that happen, and things will change.10 Verge churches recognize the power of this form of ecclesia and are willing to increasingly move in this direction. For instance, Soma is one of the Future Travelers churches that has already morphed into the early stages of movement envisioned here.11 Others are heading in the right direction,12 but it's important to note that in order to be a decentralized movement, we need to activate all six elements of mDNA and not just one. This is not to say that pure movemental forms are the only true manifestations of missional structure. By God’s common grace, there are many ways in which humans organize, some more theologically consistent and missionally potent than others. But it is to say that intentional movemental forms are most consistent with the reality of being an apostolic movement. Most likely, Verge churches will have elements of centralized organization in them — they will be hybrids of sorts — but they will definitely need to learn what it means to operate as a decentralized network if they are determined to move beyond the limitations (and costs) imposed by hierarchical organization. Much will depend on whether these churches can activate the whole people of God, but when and if they do, they will almost certainly need to learn the power of the more fluid, networked, movemental structures. If we can’t become a fully-fledged organic underground movement like the one in China (and that is unlikely, given our context, culture, and history), we can certainly begin to approximate it by moving in that direction. ## Communitas The word communitas captures the idea of the enhanced forms of community that emerges from the context of a shared ordeal, a common task, an organizational challenge, even danger. The context of the challenge forces a restructuring of the basic relational fabric of the group. In such situations, people move from being associates to becoming comrades, from being acquaintances who happen to bump into each other at church-related activities to being partners bound together in common cause. Communitas is easy to spot once you’ve seen it: sports teams, leadership teams at work facing deadlines, short-term missions teams, friends painting a house together. It forms a fundamental code that informs almost every story of coming together against the odds, whether in film, comics, or novels. People are moved outside what is perceived as safe, predictable, and normal, only to find themselves and others in a new and profound way. It forms the most basic aspect of the human adventure. Relating this to the most current expressions of church will mean we become far less risk-averse, more missional, and more willing to experiment by engaging in open-ended learning together. It will also mean we need to lean into the future and engage with our cultural contexts, as these will force us to more adaptive expressions of ecclesia. As we have seen in the section on paradigms and innovation, too much concern with safety and security, combined with comfort and convenience, has lulled us out of our true calling and purpose and has effectively blocked our God-given creativity.13 ## A Mindset, Not a Technique We suggest that any church wishing to move toward being a Verge church will need to really study the paradigm shifts necessary to become an apostolic movement (see the resources section in the back of this book). But if God is in the details, so is the Devil! Don’t let annotated bibliographies keep you and your community from (as John Wimber used to put it) doing the stuff! Trust what God has put into you; be willing to follow your deepest instinct in living it out. What you should be inspired by here is the sheer vigor of a church that can combine all six elements of the mDNA in Apostolic Genius: when a church takes Jesus with utmost seriousness and refers all matters of its life to him, when it embeds discipleship as a defining activity at every level, when it activates a broader missional ministry based on Ephesians 4, when it learns to organize and operate as a decentralized people-movement, engaging in incarnational mission and being willing to takes risks and learn, you can be sure it’s spiritually healthy and transformative. When this happens, it not only describes the possibility of movement; it is movement. Please note: I do not mean to suggest some sort of ecclesiological “technique” or church methodology here. Apostolic Genius is a mindset, an approach, a phenomenon, a way of thinking and doing church. It is the much-needed silver imagination for our times. There are internal checks and balances within it to keep it from degenerating into a mere technique. For instance, commitment to Jesus' kingdom at the heart of the church — together with the willingness to become more and more like him (apprenticeship) — ensures the spiritual health of the movement, at the heart of the movement. A movement of radical disciples worshiping Jesus as Lord cannot but be a worshiping, praying, Spirit-led, Spirit-empowered church. Now pause. Take a deep breath: God is good. Selah. If you feel like you’ve absorbed too much in this chapter, let it go. But circle back to it again later and read the material more slowly, leisurely. Anything worth knowing is worth knowing thoroughly, and we needn’t make ourselves frenetic wrecks while doing so. This is a vital discipline in our media-saturated world. You’ll be shocked at how much clearer everything will become on a subsequent read. This is the Missio Dei, and to participate in it is the highest calling you can possibly imagine, so relax and enjoy it. Let your longing lead you. The vision we’re seeing for the church can be summed up in this quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “If you want to build a ship, don’t summon people to buy wood, prepare tools, distribute jobs, and organize the work — rather, teach people the yearning for the wide, boundless ocean.” ## Dave's Response to "Apostolic Genius: The Genetic Code of Movement" While Alan took the lead on this chapter, I fully endorse and believe the inherent truth in what he calls Apostolic Genius, and I wholeheartedly agree that it gives us the genetic code of all apostolic movements. I believe this in part because it’s supported by my own research, observation, and personal experience as a church planter (Community Christian Church) and leader of an emerging movement (New Thing). The other reason is because I have heard Alan very humbly and privately talk about the six elements of mDNA as a grace that God gave him for the church. He would tell you that his understanding of Apostolic Genius is not merely a product of his own intellect but came to him almost supernaturally as a gift from God for the church, and I believe him. While I don’t want to elevate this apostolic paradigm to the level of Scripture, I am saying that both the source of this revelation and my own practice of it tell me that what we have here is a missional archetype from the primal heartbeat of God. ## Beware of Being Too Familiar As a practitioner in the midst of interacting with this apostolic paradigm, let me offer some words of caution. The elements you think you know the most may be the ones you know the least. As I have interviewed church leaders transitioning their churches to movemental thinking and behaving, a common reaction to looking at the first two of the six` },

The New Testament consistently teaches that repentance changes the way we perceive and make sense of our world—a change that goes to the very heart of consciousness. And here we arrive at the New Testament concept of metanoia, upon which this book is centered. The word metanoia is typically translated in the Bible as "repentance." But this is not a particularly accurate or comprehensive translation. This diminished understanding of the biblical concept of repentance stems from the fact that Jerome, in translating the Bible into Latin, rendered metanoia into the Latin word poenitentia, thus limiting its meaning to feelings of remorse and regret. This translation carries strong personal overtones, and so when we hear the word "repent," we tend to think of it as something we can engage in some form of restitution by actively trying to change and make amends. While it is important to feel some level of remorse in relation to our sins, as well as some form of contrition, this reductionistic understanding does not actually convey what is meant by the word metanoia. Consider instead Alister Mc Grath’s take: The Greek term metanoia—traditionally and inadequately translated as “repentance”—means something more like “a radical change of mind,” or “a fundamental intellectual re-orientation,” through which we turn thinking and living. Repentance means not primarily a sense of regret, large enough for God’s mystery. It is about a transformed metaphysical A renunciation of small-minded thinking along with a transformed vision of reality! And if this sounds over the top, what Mc Grath is asserting is clear in the linguistic structure (etymology) of the word itself. Look at the prefix meta in other words: metamorphosis (change into something completely different); metaverse (a virtual world where people can experience things like they would in the real world); or metaphysics (the study of what is "above," or "overarching." Used as a prefix it means "more comprehensive" or "beyond," suggesting an opening up to something at a higher level of reality. The second part of the word is noia, which is derived from the Greek word nous. In the New Testament, it refers to a person or society’s outlook, mental filter, orientation, or mindset. The nous is made up of a complex system of narratives, assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them. It is a “way of thinking” or a paradigm.12 “[It] is the whole group of faculties which compose intelligence: It is sight and perception, thought and reflection, apprehension and comprehension—all that is popularly known as the intellect or understanding. But it also embraces more than this, namely, a large portion of the moral and affectional nature. It occupies the realm of the heart.”13 Taken together, we believe the best translation of meta-noia is simply “paradigm shift”—or perhaps more colloquially, the experience of having your mind blown. Using the more disciplined language of the scholar, undergoing metanoia experiences the inception of a new, ultimate, and ously known: “Metanoia can be defined as being either ‘another mind’ or Clearly, metanoia is a much broader concept than the standard reduced mistranslation of repentance conveys. As theologian Richard Niebuhr observes, “The Christian responsibility ‘to repent’ demands more vague desire for reform. [Rather,] it involves the recognition and rejection metanoia always brings with it a corresponding transformation. Metanoia him, deep gratitude, and a growth in self-awareness that increases our as well as for faithful living in the kingdom.16 Crucially, as we will explore All in all, metanoia is something like the red pill in the 1999 film The Matrix.17 Take it and everything changes; you wake up in a new world. And importantly, with regards to our various VUCA situations, we believe that when individuals and organizations embrace metanoia, it increases their ability to adapt, to mature, to persevere, and to be resilient hopeful and innovative people in the midst of trials. (Much more of this in this gift, nor have we meaningfully appropriated it in our individual and has been significantly closed; our spiritual instincts have been suppressed the ever-greater God has been severely impaired. Far from the stereotypical negative perception of repentance, which leaves us feeling diminished and ashamed, it is time for us to see metanoia as of our current condition and opens us up to an ever-greater, multi-dimen- Correctly understood, repentance is not negative, but positive. It means, whole life on the Trinity. It is to look, not backward with regret, but upwards at God’s love. It is to see, not merely what we have failed to be, we see. To repent is to open our eyes to the light.18 In the rest of this chapter, we want to highlight the many dimensions of metanoia and how it can bring about fruitful change in both our lives and ## Metanoia as a Mind-Blowing Transformation of Understanding The first sentence in Jesus’ active ministry could have included any number of topics. He would later give us the Great Commandments and the Great Commission, teach the Sermon on the Mount, engage in Upper Room Discourse, and pray a high priestly prayer for the unity of his church. But those weren’t the focus of his first words. Instead, he announced, “The time has come … the kingdom of God has come near. Metanoiete and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15). The lesson? To even be able to hear and understand the most profound truths that Jesus teaches, we must first open our minds and hearts and undergo metanoia. It’s the doorway to a real experience of God. We encounter the Lord Jesus, and he immediately invites us to fundamental transformation—to metanoia! To know God is to change. Therefore, the true following of Jesus (discipleship) is marked by a significant reorientation that involves centering our whole being around the reality of God. Metanoia is the doorway to the spiritual revolution of Jesus. It allows us to discover that God is not “out there” but that we are in God and God is in us. And because we have been united to God in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, the source of all reality, we no longer look out at reality; we now look out from reality. That’s what it means to have the mind of Christ—the place where everything changes. Stuart Devenish has conducted exhaustive study on the idea of conversion, and says that authentic metanoia—because it integrates the biblically related dimensions of a radical re/orienting of life, together disciples with a whole new way of processing their lives and negotiating Paul’s conversion when scales fell from his eyes (Acts 9:18), the convert and unrecognized dimensions of reality.”20 We can perhaps now better understand what Paul means when he admonishes all believers to be constantly “transformed by the renewing of mational experience will gain a renewed way of understanding themselves, values is also thoroughly reevaluated. Metanoia allows us to experience customs, attitudes, or ideas; something that sparks a deeper connection our own role in the world; and offers a deepened perspective on things. Theologian Bernard Lonergan says that this new way of seeing the world involves what he calls a “horizon change” or a “paradigm shift.”22 In that revelatory moment, we are literally seized by a “way,” a vision, and we begin to experience our lives as meaningful through serving the new construct. Everything, including our mental maps and core commitments, are reordered as a result. Metanoia therefore involves the capacity to imagine new possibilities—the idea of an open and invigorated imagination. It is much more than a confession of personal guilt or doing penance! Likewise, theologians such as von Balthasar and Heschel see conversion as being awakened to wonder, even though this wonder is usually somewhat contained at first. The full implications of our for us to grasp in one go, and we need time to assimilate what it is that a single momentous and permanent change but also a process spread out teaches that sanctification is both instantaneous as well as ongoing, as We are both “saved” in a moment in time, but we are also called to “work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12). This twin nature of conversion is counter to much of Western evangelicalism, which places undue emphasis on conversion as a one-time, momentary decision. Our language reflects this viewpoint, with phrases such as “Get ’em saved,” and “If you died tonight, do you know where you would go? Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus.” But conversion, as Eugene Peterson puts it, is also a long obedience in the same direction.24 We never stop learning; genuine learning involves a prolonged process that will occupy a whole lifetime. This is the essence of discipleship. Metanoia is powerful because the smallest realization and new discovery can lead to new habits, patterns, and ways of relating to the world. Breakthrough thinker Olivia Fox Cabane notes that “break- lens through which you view the world has been suddenly, gloriously understanding that moves you past a barrier and makes you see things, Unfortunately, these moments can be all too rare. But this ought not to be so! Openness to ongoing metanoia ought to characterize the life of all people committed to loving, worshipping, and serving the ever-greater God. ## Metanoia as an Ever-Expansive Reframing of Reality As humans, we have the propensity to be bound by ideologies (reduced truth that claims to be the only defining truth) and by idolatries (reductions in our understanding of God, of making God small) that claim our allegiance. The only way to be released from such ideologies and idolatries is to reevaluate them in light of a greater truth.26 Metanoia involves a transformational cleansing of perception, which enables a new, expansive, way of viewing the world.27 It is therefore essential for ongoing transformation and the growth in all knowledge, especially when it comes to experiencing the God who is ever greater. If we fail to engage with conversion as an ongoing reality, we will always remain somewhat misdirected and distracted, distanced from God, and therefore unable to experience the spiritually intimate relati- metanoia in principle, we are no longer able to recognize the ever- to show us. Maturity (telos), fullness (pleroma), and the ever-expansive do so. ## Metanoia as a Crack in Your Cosmic Egg Metanoia brings with it paradigmatic insight and learning that is characteristic of breakthrough moments—those “Eureka!” experiences that seem to radically reorient our lives and trajectories. Consider, for example, creative philosopher Joseph Chilton Pearce’s description of the creative process itself as an experience of becoming aware of a crack in our seemingly self-contained worldview (what he likens to an “egg”) that eventually leads to a paradigm change at a certain point in time. His own story is one that many of us can relate to. I’ve been writing since I was old enough to read, and I have always around with it for a few days or weeks or months (and in one case that it wasn’t ready to birth.

I discovered in we become aware of the egg, and then a small crack in it, and then—by enough that the light of understanding flows in and it’s all just so clear My (Alan) own experiences are eerily similar.

Being converted and being called to mission are seen as two separate experiences, the latter being entirely optional and only for the stout-hearted. ## Broadening It All Out So far, our discussion of the heroic paradigm could give the impression that we are calling people to discover their own personal, individualistic quest, like Frodo. But the challenge of risky adventure is invariably a communal challenge. It is a band of fellow travelers thrown together to engage a greater cause than one of their number could undertake. We need to broaden Campbell’s hero myth to include, or more accurately, to presuppose, a collective rather than an individual. Also, one of the most common complaints we have received about our thoughts on liminal church is that people can’t imagine living their lives in a constant state of heightened missional activity. Surely, they ask, there must be time for contemplation, regeneration, worship, and time alone with God. Nowhere do we suggest otherwise. As we began, mission must be seen as one of the four primary functions of the church, together with discipleship, worship, and community. And as we said from the outset, mission is a marvelous catalyst, or organizer, of those other functions, but it must not be undertaken to the exclusion of them. A way to make this clearer is found in the book Metavista, written by two friends of ours, Colin Greene and Martin Robinson. In it they present what they call the “missional matrix,” an interactive framework for understanding how a community organized by mission could be shaped without compromising the essential biblical nature of the church. This framework also helps to make sense of the idea of collective heroism. They identify five broad elements to healthy missional activity: leadership, discipleship, mobilization, societal engagement, and communitas. And they see these elements being undertaken within four dimensions. We reproduce it with slight developments here:12 Figure 4.1 internal communities discipleship > Leadership communal Team individual > (APEST) social action-reflection engagement (mobilization) external ## A Missional Matrix ## The Missional Matrix According to Greene and Robinson, the Christian is responsible to serve and strengthen the internal life of the church, as well as being The Hero’s Journey involved in the mission, or external dimension, of the church. While we are called to be active and reliable members of the community of believers, we are also loved by God as individuals, and our individuality is never subsumed into the corporate. The church is not an all-assimilating collective like a beehive; it is made of unique individuals bearing the unique stamp of the imago Dei. This is seen in Jesus’s delightful stories of the one lost coin, the one lost sheep, and the one lost brother (Luke 15). When we discuss the power and importance of communitas, we do so knowing that it must be seen as one of the dimensions of the church’s life and mission. Alan developed this idea in his model of a missional DNA in The Forgotten Ways, where he highlighted communitas as one of the essential features of a missional community. With these four dimensions in mind, Greene and Robinson then develop four quadrants in which the missional life of a church unfolds. They are the internal-individual, the external-individual, the external-community, and the internal-community. In each of these quadrants, a different aspect of missional life is catalyzed. It should also be borne in mind that each of the quadrants informs and inspires the others in some measure as well (indicated by the doubleheaded arrows in the diagram above). By examining each of these quadrants, we can show that while communitas is essential, it sits within a broader matrix of missional activity. 1. The I nternal-Individual Quadrant—Discipleship The church is responsible to create and mature individual disciples, and this is an “internal” aspect of the church, although as we stated earlier, engagement in mission is a marvelous catalyst for discipling believers. Greene and Robinson indicate this in their diagram by showing how the mobilizing of believers into mission helps shape them as disciples. Unless the church is equipping believers to embrace the values and vision of the kingdom of God and turn away from the materialism, consumerism, greed and power of the present age, it not only abandons its biblical mandate, it is rendered missionally ineffective. Greene and Robinson identify two particular aspects of disciple-making: developing habits of the heart, and embracing spiritual disciplines. On the former they say, “The phrase habits of the heart is used to describe those core disciplines which are normally built deeply into the lives of individuals and communities and enable those individuals and communities to flourish.”13 Following Robert Bellah, from whom they borrow the phrase, they identify important habits of the heart as including an orientation toward community rather than rampant individualism, an abandonment of consumerism, and a separation of happiness from virtue. From the platform of these transformative habits of the heart, the authors then suggest we build a number of spiritual disciplines and undergird a deepening and developing commitment to discipleship. They point out, Spiritual disciplines offer us a range of commitments and rhythms which build on other good habits, further reinforcing them but also moving us closer to a capacity to hear God and so develop a sense of direction in relation to our calling or vocation in the world.14 This is nothing we haven’t written ourselves in such books as Untamed (Alan) and Exiles (Michael), but it does very helpfully place the exercise of spiritual disciplines within the broader matrix of missional engagement. In our opinion, most people write about spiritual disciplines as though they are ends in themselves, or at least divorced from the liminality of adventurous discipleship. For instance, we have never seen risk-taking, or even mission, suggested as a spiritual exercise. But seeing them as one quadrant, necessarily catalyzed by missional mobilization and in the context of communitas, is very helpful. This takes us back to the Celts’ cell and coracle that we mentioned earlier. They are not mutually exclusive experiences. Indeed, each is diminished markedly by the absence of the other. 2. The External-Individual Quadrant—Mobilization When individual believers are adequately discipled—taught, mentored, corrected, encouraged—they cannot but live out their deep devotion to Jesus in their homes, their workplaces, and their leisure pursuits. This is the external-individual aspect of mission, the mobilization of disciples into the world. Indeed, this is the very place that such discipleship is to be lived out. As David Bosch says, The Hero’s Journey Discipleship is determined by the relation to Christ himself, not by mere conformity to impersonal commands. The context of this is not in the classroom (where “teaching” normally takes place), or even in the church, but in the world.15 Every believer who takes seriously their vocation as a disciple of Jesus will see themselves as a “sent one” wherever they find themselves, and will look to be mobilized into action in that place. As Greene and Robinson make clear, There comes a time when as individuals we accept responsibility for the calling we have been given and begin to experiment with a specific ministry to serve others. Every Christian has a vocation that needs to be exercised.16 This could take the form of being a “good witness” at work or a good neighbor to those who live nearby, or it could involve volunteering to serve on the PTA or the local neighborhood watch committee. These are the kinds of things individual Christians involve themselves in as an expression of their devotion to Jesus. But there are also those communal missional projects where we are encouraged to join with other believers in a concerted effort for the sake of the gospel. This leads us to the third quadrant. 3. The External-Community Quadrant— Societal Engagement Greene and Robinson’s third quadrant sees believers joining together in a missional project, or a “societal engagement,” to use their expression. While affirming the importance of being a strong Christian example in our workplaces, they also point out that it is necessary and important for us to find opportunities to work together as disciples on a joint project. They explain, The mobilization of many individuals requires a social context in which the ministries that mobilization produces can be exercised. Most Christians will engage with the world within a relatively small distance from their home and workplace. Of course, for some people the workplace can be a huge distance from the home and that raises particular challenges for those individuals—but again, most people wish for some kind of engagement with the community of people where they worship, where they have friends, where their children go to school, and where they play sport or socialize with others.17 This external-community quadrant is essential for healthy mission, and we would argue, for healthy discipleship. Many people have told us that they see their primary “calling” is to serve the church and to simply be a good witness at work and in their neighborhood. They have no need, nor desire, to join a communal missional project. But when this quadrant is missing, so is the opportunity for communitas, and indeed, so is the opportunity for healthy discipleship. There is something insidious about the idea of solo discipleship. As we mentioned earlier, Paul’s letters were written to communities, and they presuppose a communal response to the teaching they contain. We don’t dismiss the validity and importance of individual witness, but we can’t step away from the biblical imperative of communal mission. 4. The I nternal-Community Quadrant—Communitas When disciples adopt a communal missional project, they find that the internal-community dynamic is that of communitas. As we’ve been saying, the communal aspect of the church-in-mission is that deep, intimate sense of comradeship Victor Turner termed communitas. We don’t intend to say much more here, other than to point out its relation to discipleship and engagement. According to Greene and Robinson’s missional matrix, you can’t expect to experience communitas unless you are engaged in mission with fellow disciples. ——— Having looked briefly at these four quadrants, it might be tempting to see them in some simplistic cause-and-effect relationship—when we disciple individuals, they will naturally be mobilized into action, and when enough of them are so mobilized, they will get involved in joint projects, and that in turn leads to communitas. It might be illustrated like this: Figure 4.2 discipleship action societal communitas (spiritual disciplines) (mobilization) engagement The Hero’s Journey By developing their model as a matrix, Greene and Robinson are indicating that there is no linear cause-and-effect at work here. It’s not as simple as assuming that if we disciple believers effectively, they will end up being mobilized into service. There are too many incidents of well-trained and discipled Christians never serving anyone. Likewise, it’s naive to assume that by just throwing people into a communal missional project, they will automatically experience communitas. Indeed the matrix shows that all four quadrants play on each other quite dramatically. They need to be managed as concurrent priorities, believing that discipleship, personal witness, communal mission, and communitas catalyze and sharpen each other. Combining this with what we believe to be the four functions of the church (more on this later), this can be illustrated as follows: Figure 4.3 liminality risk communitas mission discipleship engagement disciplines spiritual societal missio Dei community worship action reflection (mobilization) mission adventure Our growth as disciples influences our personal mobilization and our communal engagement in society. Our communal engagement in society influences our experience of communitas and our growth as disciples. And so on. The missional matrix reminds us that keeping all four quadrants healthy is essential for effective mission. It reminds us that as much as we need to embark upon a heroic journey, we ought rarely to consider doing this alone. Never underestimate the power of an heroic band of brothers and sisters setting out on a risky journey to participate in the unfurling of the kingdom of God in` },
