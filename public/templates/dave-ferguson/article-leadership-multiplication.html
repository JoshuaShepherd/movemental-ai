    <article class="e-article-body">
      <p>For most of my leadership journey, I was trying to be a hero. I wanted to be the one who preached the best sermons, cast the biggest vision, and solved the hardest problems. I measured my success by how much I accomplished, how many people showed up, and how indispensable I became to the organization.</p>

      <p>I didn't realize I was trapped. The hero role is seductive because it feeds our ego and garners immediate results. But it's also limiting, exhausting, and ultimately counterproductive to building movements that outlast us.</p>

      <p>The shift from hero to hero maker isn't just a leadership technique—it's a complete reorientation of how we measure success, spend our time, and invest in others. And it changes everything.</p>

      <h2 id="the-hero-trap">The Hero Trap: Why Being Indispensable Is a Problem</h2>

      <p>Most leaders fall into the hero trap without even realizing it. We start with good intentions—we want to serve, make an impact, help people. But somewhere along the way, we become the center of everything. People come to us for answers. We're in every important meeting. Nothing significant happens without our involvement.</p>

      <p>This feels like success. After all, isn't this what leadership is supposed to look like? Aren't the best leaders supposed to be the smartest, most capable people in the room?</p>

      <p>The problem is that hero leadership creates a ceiling. Your organization can only grow as big as your personal capacity. Your influence can only extend as far as you can personally reach. And when you're gone—whether for a sabbatical, a vacation, or eventually retirement—things fall apart.</p>

      <h3>The Metrics That Mislead Us</h3>

      <p>Hero leaders measure the wrong things. We count attendance, budget size, square footage, and programs. These metrics all have one thing in common: they measure what we've personally accomplished. They feed the narrative that we're the indispensable hero.</p>

      <p>But what if we measured something different? What if instead of counting how many people we've led, we counted how many leaders we've developed? Instead of tracking our personal impact, we tracked the collective impact of the people we've empowered?</p>

      <h2 id="multiplication-mindset">The Multiplication Mindset: A Different Way to Lead</h2>

      <p>Hero makers operate from a fundamentally different paradigm. Instead of asking "How can I accomplish more?" they ask "How can I multiply my impact through others?" Instead of being threatened by rising leaders, they actively look for opportunities to give away responsibility and authority.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"The true measure of a leader is not what you accomplish, but what you accomplish through others. And the ultimate measure is what they accomplish after you're gone."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This shift in mindset leads to a shift in behavior. Hero makers invest the majority of their time developing leaders rather than doing the work themselves. They create permission-giving cultures where people are empowered to experiment, fail, and learn. They measure success in generations, not just increments.</p>

      <h3>From Addition to Multiplication</h3>

      <p>There's a mathematical principle at work here. When you do the work yourself, you're adding to the total output. When you develop one leader who develops other leaders, you're multiplying. And multiplication always outpaces addition over time.</p>

      <p>Think about it this way: If you personally lead one person to Christ every day for a year, you'll reach 365 people. Impressive. But if you invest in one person, and both of you reach one person who reaches another person, and that pattern continues with each generation taking just one month to reproduce—within three years you'd reach over 16 million people. That's the power of multiplication.</p>

      <div class="e-article-wide-img"></div>

      <h2 id="five-practices">The Five Essential Practices of a Hero Maker</h2>

      <p>Making the shift from hero to hero maker isn't magic. It's not about personality type or natural gifting. It's about learning and implementing five essential practices that any leader can develop.</p>

      <h3>1. Multiplication Thinking</h3>

      <p>Before you can become a hero maker, you have to think like one. This means regularly asking yourself: Who am I developing? How am I empowering others? What would happen if I wasn't here? Multiplication thinking is intentional and strategic. It doesn't happen accidentally.</p>

      <h3>2. Permission Giving</h3>

      <p>Hero makers create cultures where people don't have to wait for permission to lead, innovate, and take risks. Instead of being gatekeepers, they're door openers. They default to "yes" and actively look for opportunities to hand off responsibility to emerging leaders.</p>

      <h3>3. Disciple Multiplying</h3>

      <p>This goes beyond simply recruiting volunteers or filling positions. Hero makers are intentional about investing in people who will invest in others. They think in terms of spiritual generations—disciples who make disciples who make disciples.</p>

      <h3>4. Gift Activating</h3>

      <p>Every person has God-given gifts and talents. Hero makers are talent scouts, constantly looking for the unique abilities in others and creating opportunities for those gifts to flourish. They understand that their job isn't to do everything well—it's to help others discover and deploy their gifts.</p>

      <h3>5. Kingdom Building</h3>

      <p>Hero makers are more committed to the kingdom than their own kingdom. They're willing to release their best leaders to plant churches, start new initiatives, or take on roles in other organizations. They celebrate when their people succeed, even if it means losing them from their own team.</p>

      <h2 id="getting-started">How to Start Making the Shift Today</h2>

      <p>If you're ready to move from hero to hero maker, here's where to start:</p>

      <p>First, do an honest audit of how you spend your time. What percentage of your week is spent doing work versus developing people who can do that work? For most leaders, this reveals that we're spending 80% of our time being heroes and only 20% making heroes. Flip that ratio.</p>

      <p>Second, identify three to five emerging leaders you can invest in deeply. Don't try to develop everyone at once. Focus on the people who have the potential and desire to multiply. Meet with them regularly. Give them real responsibilities. Coach them through failures. Celebrate their wins.</p>

      <p>Third, start giving away what you love to do most. This is the hardest part. We all have areas of leadership we're good at and enjoy. But if we never release those areas to others, we cap their development and our collective impact. What's one thing you could hand off this month?</p>

      <p>Finally, change what you celebrate. In your team meetings, one-on-ones, and public gatherings, start highlighting and honoring people who are developing other leaders. Make hero making the new definition of success in your organization.</p>

      <h2 id="transformation">The Transformation Ahead</h2>

      <p>I won't pretend this shift is easy. Moving from hero to hero maker requires dying to our ego, letting go of control, and redefining how we measure success. There will be moments when it feels like you're accomplishing less because you're not the one doing everything anymore.</p>

      <p>But over time, you'll see something incredible happen. The leaders you've invested in will start accomplishing things you never could have done yourself. They'll reach people you never would have reached. They'll launch initiatives you never would have imagined. And then they'll start developing other leaders who do the same.</p>

      <p>That's when you realize: you're not building an organization anymore. You're catalyzing a movement. And movements change the world.</p>

      <p>The question isn't whether you can make this shift. The question is: will you? Because the kingdom needs fewer heroes and more hero makers. It needs leaders who are willing to decrease so others can increase. Leaders who measure success not by their own accomplishments but by the leaders they leave behind.</p>

      <p>The shift from hero to hero maker changes everything. And it starts with you.</p>
