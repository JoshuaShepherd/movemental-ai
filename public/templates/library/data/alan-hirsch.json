This is the mDNA course — and over the next eight weeks, we are going to rediscover the genetic code of apostolic movements together.\n\nBut before we get into the content, I need to tell you what this course is *not*. This is not an information course. You will not simply consume ideas and move on with your life unchanged. If all you wanted was information, I would hand you a book and say, \"Go in peace.\" A book can transfer information. A course exists because something needs to happen that a book cannot do — and that something is *formation*. We are here for transformation, not just education.\n\nSo here is my promise to you: over these eight weeks, we will do more than learn concepts. We will practice. We will reflect. We will experiment in the real world. And we will do it together — because formation never happens in isolation. It happens in community, and specifically in the kind of community that forms when people are on a shared journey toward something that matters.\n\nLet me tell you why this particular content matters right now.\n\nAbout fifteen years ago, I attended a seminar where a speaker asked a simple question: \"How many Christians were there in the year AD 100?\" The answer? As few as 25,000. Then he asked: \"How many by AD 310?\" Up to 20 million. And then he asked the question that has haunted me ever since: \"How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?\"\n\nThat question sent me on a decades-long quest. And what I found — what I believe the Lord revealed — is that there is a power lying hidden at the very heart of God's people. A set of primal energies that have driven every significant Jesus movement in history. I came to call this Apostolic Genius, and the elements that compose it I call mDNA — Missional DNA.\n\nHere is the extraordinary thing: this is not something we need to *invent*. It is something we need to *remember*. The feedback I receive most often from readers is, \"I feel like I already knew this, I just couldn't articulate it.\" And every time I hear that, I think: *Yes. That is exactly the point.* The Spirit is once again brooding over the church, calling us back to what we have always carried within us.\n\nSo what is mDNA? Think of biological DNA — it is found in every cell, it carries the vital information for the organism, and it has the remarkable capacity to reproduce itself. What DNA does for biological systems, mDNA does for ecclesial ones. There are six elements, and they are readily discernible in every authentic Christian movement — from the early church to the Chinese underground church to the Methodist revolution:\n\n**Jesus Is Lord** — the absolute center. Everything flows from this confession. It is both the simplest and the most radical claim we can make.\n\n**Disciple-Making** — the essential practice. Movements grow only in proportion to their capacity to make disciples. No disciples, no movement.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse** — the twin dynamic of going out and going deep. Sent into the world like Jesus was sent, and embedding ourselves incarnationally in culture and context.\n\n**APEST Culture** — the fivefold intelligence. Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher — the distributed ministry system Christ gave for the maturity and mission of his body.\n\n**Organic Systems** — movemental structures. Simple, reproducible, networked patterns that enable multiplication rather than mere addition.\n\n**Communitas** — liminal community. The deep bond that forms when people share a dangerous journey together. Not community as we normally conceive it, but the extraordinary togetherness that emerges from shared mission and risk.\n\nEach of these is powerful on its own. But here is what you must understand: it is the whole system that creates Apostolic Genius, not any single element. There are no silver bullets — but there is a silver imagination that emerges when all six elements come together. And the weakest element limits the health of the entire system, the way the shortest stave of a barrel limits how much water it can hold.\n\nNow let me tell you about how we will journey together.\n\nEach week, we will focus on one element of mDNA. You will engage with a main reading, reflect through guided questions, and undertake field experiments — real-world, observable practices in your own context. You will also engage with your cohort through structured discussion. And every week opens and closes with a moment of worship and devotion, because this is not merely an intellectual exercise. We are placing ourselves under the lordship of Jesus and asking the Spirit to form us.\n\nWeek 0 — this week — is your foundation. You will take a baseline assessment that helps you identify where you are on the mDNA journey and where your growth edges lie. You will introduce yourself to your cohort. And you will begin to map the context where you will apply what you learn.\n\nI want to say something directly to you: you are here because God has placed something in you that the world desperately needs. The church you lead, the community you serve, the people you walk alongside — they carry within them the same latent potencies that energized the early Christians and the Chinese underground church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in you, in me, and in every local church that seeks to follow Jesus faithfully.\n\nWe have simply forgotten how to access it.\n\nThese eight weeks are about remembering. Not learning something foreign, but recovering something ancient. Not importing a new program, but reactivating the genetic code that was always there.\n\nSo welcome. I am genuinely glad you are here. Introduce yourself to the others in your cohort this week. Tell them where you are, what you lead, and what brought you to this moment. Because from this point on, we journey together.\n\nLet's begin."

                  "reading": "We stand at a remarkable crossroads. The Western church finds itself in a moment that is simultaneously a crisis and an invitation — a moment that, if we have the courage to read it rightly, could become the seedbed for the most significant renewal we have seen in centuries. But to step into that future, we need to recover something the church has carried within itself from the beginning. Something ancient, potent, and largely forgotten.\n\nThis course is about that recovery.\n\nOver the next eight weeks, we will explore what I call **mDNA — Missional DNA** — the six-element genetic code that has driven every significant Jesus movement in recorded history. From the explosive growth of the early church (25,000 believers in AD 100 to 20 million by AD 310) to the staggering multiplication of the Chinese underground church (2 million to over 120 million in seventy years under severe persecution), the same dynamics appear again and again. They are not accidental. They are not cultural. They are the deep architecture of how God moves his people into the world.\n\nThe claim of this course — and it is a bold one — is that **the church Jesus started already has everything in it to get its job done**. Apostolic Genius, the emergent phenomenon that appears when all six elements of mDNA are active and interacting, is not something we need to import from outside. It is latent within you, within your community, within every gathering of believers that takes Jesus seriously. We have, quite simply, forgotten how to access it.\n\nThis is a course of remembering, not merely learning.\n\n## The Six Elements\n\nEach week of the course will focus on one element of mDNA. Here is the map:\n\n**Jesus Is Lord** — The heart and foundation. The confession that restructures all of life around the person and work of Jesus Christ. Not a slogan, but a worldview in three words. Everything else flows from this center.\n\n**Disciple-Making** — The essential practice. Movements grow in direct proportion to their capacity to form people who look like Jesus. Discipleship is the church's primary commission — and evangelism happens within it, not alongside it.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse** — The twin movement of going out (mission) and going deep (incarnation). Like the two blades of a pair of scissors, these impulses work together: one extends the gospel into new contexts, the other embeds it deeply into culture.\n\n**APEST Culture** — The fivefold intelligence Christ has given to the whole body: Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher. When all five are active, the church matures toward the fullness of Christ. When some are exiled, the body runs on less than all its cylinders.\n\n**Organic Systems** — Movemental structures. Simple, reproducible, networked patterns that enable multiplication. Think farmer, not CEO. Think seed, tree, forest — not factory, product, distribution.\n\n**Communitas** — The extraordinary community that forms when people share a liminal experience — a threshold, a risk, a mission that stretches them beyond comfort. Not community as we normally conceive it, but the deep bond forged in shared adventure.\n\nAfter exploring each element, we will spend a week on **integration and system integrity** — because the power of mDNA is in the whole, not the parts. The weakest element limits the entire system, and our task is to identify and strengthen that limiting factor.\n\n## How This Course Works: Formation, Not Information\n\nLet me be direct about the philosophy behind this course. We have designed every element to serve **formation** — lasting change in how you see, decide, and act. This means several things:\n\n**You will encounter dissonance.** Some of what we explore will challenge your assumptions about church, leadership, and mission. That discomfort is not a bug — it is a feature. Formation requires a willingness to stand in threshold spaces where old frameworks are being questioned and new ones are not yet fully formed. The early church thrived in precisely these conditions.\n\n**You will take action.** Each week includes field experiments — real-world, observable practices in your own context. You will map your neighborhood, have specific conversations, test patterns in your community, and bring back evidence of what you experienced. Content serves practice in this course, not the other way around.\n\n**You will reflect.** After each action and each reading, you will engage with structured reflection questions that help you process what you are learning and connect it to your life. Doing without reflection is activity, not formation. We pair them intentionally.\n\n**You will journey in community.** You are part of a cohort. Each week includes discussion prompts and cohort sessions structured around Explore, Evaluate, Employ, and Journal. The people walking this path alongside you are not incidental — they are essential. Transformation is sustained and deepened in relationship.\n\n## Your Baseline and Personalized Pathway\n\nThis week, you will take a **baseline mDNA assessment**. This is not a test — it is a diagnostic. It will help you identify which of the six elements is strongest in your context and which is your **limiting factor** — the element that, if strengthened, would have the most significant impact on the whole system.\n\nYour results will shape a personalized pathway through the course. While everyone engages with every element, the assessment helps you know where to press in hardest, where your growth edge lies, and what to watch for as we journey together.\n\nWe will revisit this assessment at mid-course (Week 4) and at the close (Week 8) so you can see how your understanding and practice have grown. The goal is not a perfect score. The goal is movement — tangible, visible, Spirit-empowered movement toward the fullness of what God has placed within you and your community.\n\n## How to Succeed in This Course\n\nThree commitments will determine whether this course changes you:\n\n**Show up consistently.** Each week builds on the previous one. The framework is cumulative and systemic — skip a week and you lose the thread that connects the elements into a whole.\n\n**Do the experiments.** Reading about mission is not mission. The field experiments are where formation actually happens. They are designed to be achievable (one to two hours) and observable (you bring back evidence of what you did and what you noticed). Do them.\n\n**Engage your cohort.** Post your reflections. Respond to others. Share what you are discovering. The course is designed so that your formation is deepened by the formation of those around you. We become comrades on a shared journey — and that is closer to the New Testament pattern than any solo learning experience.\n\n## The Journey Ahead\n\nThe early Christians did not have seminary degrees, church buildings, denominational structures, or professional clergy. What they had was a simple confession — Jesus is Lord — and the six primal dynamics that flow from that confession. Under the power of the Spirit, those dynamics turned a handful of Jewish disciples into the most significant movement in human history.\n\nThat same genetic code is in you. It is in your church. It is in every community of believers that dares to take Jesus at his word and step into the adventure of missional faithfulness.\n\nThe future is in the womb of the present. The possibility of movement lies at the heart of every church. Our task is to remember what we have forgotten, and to activate what has been lying dormant.\n\nLet's begin."

It gives you a snapshot of where you and your context stand right now across the six elements of Missional DNA. Think of it the way a physician thinks about a health panel — not as a final judgment, but as information that shapes the path forward.\n\nYour results will show relative strength across six areas: Jesus Is Lord, Disciple-Making, Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas. Each element contributes to the overall health of what we call Apostolic Genius — the emergent phenomenon that appears when all six are active and interacting in a living system.\n\n### What Your Scores Mean\n\nHigher scores in a given element indicate areas where your community or personal practice already carries momentum. These are not areas to neglect — they are strengths to steward and build from.\n\nLower scores indicate your **growth edge** — the area where intentional attention could produce the most significant change across the whole system. In living systems, the weakest element functions as a **limiting factor**, much like the shortest stave of a barrel limits how much water it can hold. Strengthening your limiting factor does not just improve one area; it raises the capacity of the entire system.\n\n### What \"Personalized Pathway\" Means\n\nAs you move through the course, every week covers one mDNA element. Everyone engages with every module. But your assessment results help you know **where to lean in hardest**. When we reach the week that addresses your limiting factor, that is the week to press deeper — spend extra time with the reflection questions, give more energy to the field experiment, bring your honest questions to your cohort.\n\nYour pathway is not a track that separates you from others. It is a lens that personalizes a shared journey. We walk the same road, but you know which terrain to pay closest attention to.\n\n### What \"Growth Edge\" Means\n\nA growth edge is not a failure. It is the frontier where the Spirit is most likely at work, precisely because it is the place where your current capacity meets a new challenge. Growth edges feel uncomfortable — and that discomfort is not a sign that something is wrong. It is a sign that formation is happening.\n\nOver the eight weeks of this course, you will return to your assessment at two key points: mid-course (Week 4) and at the close (Week 8). Each time, you will have the opportunity to see how your understanding and practice have shifted. The goal is not to achieve a perfect score. The goal is observable movement — in your thinking, in your practice, and in the life of your community.\n\n### Connecting Assessment to Journey\n\nYour assessment results are the starting point of a formation journey, not its conclusion. The six elements of mDNA are a living system — they interact, reinforce, and challenge one another. As you grow in one area, you will often discover that other areas begin to shift as well. Trust the process. Trust the Spirit. And trust the community that is walking this road with you.\n\nTake a moment now to record your results and your initial reflections. What surprised you? Where do you feel the most energy? Where do you sense resistance? Bring these observations to your cohort introduction this week."

Write this down — in a journal, a note, or a document you will keep for the duration of the course. You will revisit this commitment at mid-course and at the close.\n\n**Reflection Prompts:**\n1. What would it look like for this course to genuinely transform — not just inform — the way you lead and live?\n2. What is the one thing you are most afraid this course might ask of you?\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 3: Introduce Yourself to Your Cohort\n\n**Instructions:** Post an introduction to your cohort (in the discussion forum or your cohort channel). Include: your name, where you live and serve, one sentence about what brought you to this course, and one honest hope for the journey ahead. Keep it brief (3–5 sentences) and real. You are not performing — you are showing up. Read at least two other introductions and respond with a word of welcome or a question.\n\n**Reflection Prompts:**\n1.

But I would encourage you to read the Introduction and Chapter 3 (\"Preparing for the Journey\") this week. These two chapters lay the foundation: the historical question that launched the search for Apostolic Genius, the DNA metaphor, and the six elements that compose the system. Having this framework in hand will sharpen everything we explore together.\n\nAs we move through the course, each week will correspond to a specific chapter. Read alongside the modules when you can — the book provides the depth and nuance that a course reading can only introduce.

                  "_videoScript": "I want to say something at the outset that may create some productive discomfort: the Great Commission is not about evangelism. It is about disciple-making.\n\nNow I know that claim provokes a reaction. We have so habitually used \"the Great Commission\" as a synonym for evangelism that the suggestion feels like heresy. But I need you to look at the text with fresh eyes: \"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them... and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\" There is no overt mention of evangelism at all. The text explicitly binds us to the practices of discipleship and disciple-making. Evangelism gets done along the way, as you go about disciple-making — it happens in its proper context. Discipleship is evangelism's true context.\n\nThis matters more than you might initially think. This is not a semantic quibble — it is a strategic reorientation. Because once you grasp that the Great Commission is about formation rather than proclamation, everything changes: how you measure success, how you spend your resources, how you organize your community, and what you expect of every single person who confesses Jesus as Lord.\n\n**[CORE TEACHING — The Strategic Nerve]**\n\nLast week we established the center: Jesus is Lord. This week we explore the first and most direct expression of that lordship — the practice of making disciples.\n\nI can say categorically that one of the most demonstrably identifiable aspects of catalytic movements is that they are obsessed with discipleship and disciple-making. Discipleship is factored in from beginning to end, and at every level of the organization. Take discipleship and disciple-making out of the equation, and these movements would never have been what they were.\n\nAnd the formula is breathtakingly simple: no disciples, no movement. Some disciples, some movement. Many disciples — deeply formed, actively multiplying followers of Jesus — create the real basis on which movements generate and develop.\n\nSo what is discipleship? At its core, it involves the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message as well as his interior habits. It has rightly been said that discipleship is who Jesus would be if he were you. Or perhaps: doing the same kind of things Jesus did for the same kind of reasons he did them.\n\nThis is profoundly different from what discipleship has become in many churches — a twelve-week class, a transfer of information, a curriculum completed. Jesus's approach to discipleship is based on the idea that we need to change people's behavior, and their thinking will follow. We act our way into a new way of thinking, not think our way into a new way of acting. The Western church has been trying to educate people into faithfulness for centuries, and we have produced generations of admirers of Jesus rather than followers. Admirers are hard to motivate and need to be constantly entertained. Only real followers will go the distance.\n\n**[THE STAKES — Why This Is Life-or-Death]**\n\nHere is why this matters at a systemic level: the quality of the church's leadership is directly proportional to the quality of its discipleship. If we fail in the area of making disciples, we should not be surprised if we fail in leadership development. If you cannot make disciples, you cannot reproduce leaders. If you cannot reproduce leaders, you cannot reproduce churches. The pipeline is sequential, and discipleship is the headwater.\n\nWhich means the crisis of leadership in the Western church is not fundamentally a leadership problem. It is a discipleship problem. We have been treating a symptom and ignoring the disease.\n\n**[SIGNPOST — What to Watch For This Week]**\n\nThis week I want you to pay attention to several things as you work through the material.\n\nFirst, notice the difference between the Hebraic and Hellenistic approaches to knowledge. One prioritizes concepts and information. The other prioritizes obedience and concrete existence. Jesus operated from the Hebraic tradition, and it changes everything about how we approach formation.\n\nSecond, pay attention to the relationship between discipleship and consumerism. I was trained as a marketer and advertiser before I came to Christ, and I have little doubt that consumerism is the single greatest rival religion to Christianity operating in Western culture today. The only antidote is deeper discipleship — becoming more and more like Jesus.\n\nThird, notice the recurring pattern in every movement case study: when discipleship is the irreplaceable practice, movements are born. When it becomes an optional extra, movements die. The Methodists learned this. The early church catechumenate demonstrated this. The Chinese underground church proved this under extraordinary pressure.\n\n**[CLOSE — The Defining Question]**\n\nI want to leave you with a question that will surface throughout everything we explore this week. It is not whether you believe in discipleship. Every church leader I have ever met believes in discipleship. The question is whether you are making disciples. And the question after that is whether the disciples you are making are making disciples.\n\nThat is where movement lives. Let's go."

Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nNotice what Jesus does not say. He does not say, \"Go and hold evangelistic rallies.\" He does not say, \"Go and build institutions.\" He does not say, \"Go and develop programs.\" He says, *make disciples*. The Great Commission is not a synonym for evangelism — it is a mandate for formation. And it carries the full authority of the one who just declared that all power in heaven and on earth belongs to him. When Jesus is Lord, disciple-making is the strategic nerve of the entire operation. Every movement that has ever changed the world was driven by this practice. And every movement that lost it — no matter how impressive its buildings, budgets, or attendance — eventually declined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n1. When you hear \"make disciples,\" what image comes to mind — a program, a relationship, or something else? Where did that image come from?\n2. If the Great Commission is primarily about making disciples rather than about evangelism, how would that reframe the way your community measures its faithfulness?\n\n**Prayer:**\n\nLord Jesus, you who hold all authority, you chose to change the world not through institutions or spectacles but through the patient, relentless practice of forming people who look like you. Forgive us where we have substituted programs for presence, information for formation, and events for the irreplaceable work of life-on-life discipleship. Make us makers of disciples — not admirers of you, but followers of you, and formers of followers. Amen."

And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia — your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nThis is the anatomy of a discipleship chain. Paul says three extraordinary things: First, *you became imitators of us and of the Lord* — discipleship happens through embodied example, not abstract instruction. Second, *you became a model to all the believers* — those who are discipled become disciplers; the pattern reproduces itself. Third, *the Lord's message rang out from you* — the gospel spreads not through programs but through formed lives. Notice: Paul does not say, \"We preached the message everywhere.\" He says, \"Your faith has become known everywhere.\" The transmission medium is not proclamation — it is transformation.\n\nThis is how movements actually work. Jesus forms Paul. Paul forms the Thessalonians. The Thessalonians become a model to Macedonia and Achaia. And the message spreads — not because someone organized an evangelistic campaign, but because formed lives are contagious. The gospel is like a virus that needs a host, a carrier, to get spread around. Discipleship provides the hosts.\n\nThe uncomfortable question is whether our lives are transmitting anything worth imitating. Paul could say \"follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ\" without a trace of arrogance — because he meant it. He had so oriented his life around Jesus that his daily patterns, his relationships, his responses under pressure were recognizably Christlike. We are living letters whose message is constantly being read by others. The question is: what are people reading?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. Who discipled you — not through a program, but through their embodied life? What was it about their way of being that formed you?\n2. If you traced the chain of imitation backward from your own faith — who modeled it for the person who modeled it for you? And who is next in the chain after you?"

                  "reading": "Discipleship is the lived response to the confession. Last week we established that Jesus is Lord — not as a doctrinal checkbox but as the organizing center of all reality. This week's question is: what does that lordship produce? The answer is disciples — people whose lives are being reshaped by the one they confess as Lord. A church that takes discipleship seriously is a church that takes Jesus and the gospel seriously. A church that does not take discipleship seriously is a church that does not take Jesus seriously. And a church that does not take Jesus seriously is not really a church at all. The confession without the formation is hollow. The formation without the confession has no center.\n\n---\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**\n\nDisciples are sent people. The practice of following Jesus naturally moves outward — into neighborhoods, workplaces, and the margins of society. You cannot make missionaries without first making disciples, and you cannot sustain mission without ongoing formation. When we explore the missional-incarnational impulse in Week 3, you will see that mission without discipleship burns people out, while discipleship without mission turns inward and becomes self-serving. The two are inseparable — like inhaling and exhaling in the same breath.\n\n---\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ APEST Culture**\n\nDiscipleship is the soil in which the fivefold gifts take root. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers do not emerge from leadership pipelines — they emerge from discipleship cultures where people are being formed into the fullness of Christ. When we reach Week 4, you will see that the Ephesians 4 gifts are not positions to be filled but capacities to be cultivated — and cultivation happens in the context of deep, life-on-life discipleship. If we are not making disciples, we should not wonder about the absence of apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic function in our communities.\n\n---\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Organic Systems**\n\nSimple, reproducible discipleship is the engine of multiplication. If the initial model is not readily reproducible by the regular, \"nonprofessional\" Christian, it will not multiply. Complexity is the contraceptive of movement. When we explore organic systems in Week 5, you will see that the organizational structures of movements are designed to serve the multiplication of disciples — not the other way around. Neil Cole's Life Transformation Groups multiply because they are simple enough for anyone to reproduce and demanding enough to produce genuine formation. That is the organic principle at work.\n\n---\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Communitas**\n\nFormation happens best in the context of shared risk and mission. Disciple-making is not a classroom exercise — it is a journey into liminal spaces where people discover who they are becoming by following Jesus into the unknown together. When we explore communitas in Week 6, you will see that the deepest formation happens not in safety and comfort but in the crucible of shared challenge. The early church was not formed by its programs — it was formed by its persecutions, its shared meals, its willingness to follow Jesus into dangerous places together. Discipleship creates the relational depth that makes communitas possible, and communitas creates the conditions in which discipleship accelerates."

We traced the definition of discipleship from its Hebraic roots through the early church catechumenate, through Wesley's classes and bands, through the Chinese underground church and Neil Cole's Life Transformation Groups. We named the enemy — consumerism as a rival religion — and identified the only antidote: becoming more and more like Jesus through the irreplaceable, life-on-life practice of formation.\n\nThe central insight is strategic: movements grow only in proportion to their capacity to make disciples. No disciples, no movement. The quality of leadership flows from the quality of discipleship. The pipeline is sequential, and discipleship is the headwater.\n\n## Commitment\n\nBefore you move on, I want to ask you to make a concrete commitment. Not a vague intention.

Tell someone. Let the chain of imitation extend one more link.\n\n## Blessing\n\nMay the Lord who chose to change the world through the patient, relentless practice of forming ordinary people into his likeness give you the courage to do the same. May you be not merely an admirer of Jesus but a follower — and a former of followers. May the chain that began with Jesus and ran through Paul and Timothy and faithful people across twenty centuries extend through you to someone who does not yet know how much they need it. And may you discover, as every movement maker before you has discovered, that there is no shortcut to this work and no substitute for it — and no greater privilege in the world. Amen."

                  "reading": "Discipleship has been so reduced in the Western church that we need to rebuild the concept from the ground up.\n\nAt its core, discipleship involves the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message as well as his interior habits. It is our heartfelt response to Jesus as Lord and Savior. It involves our deepest commitments to allow his life to infuse ours and ours to be drawn up into his — what Paul calls \"in Christ\" union, and what John calls \"abiding.\" Christ being formed in you, and you being formed in Christ.\n\nIt has rightly been said that discipleship is who Jesus would be if he were you. Or perhaps: doing the same kind of things Jesus did for the same kind of reasons he did them.\n\nThis is profoundly different from what discipleship has become in many churches — a twelve-week class, a transfer of information, a curriculum completed. The Hebraic understanding of knowledge, the one Jesus operated from, is not primarily concerned with concepts and ideas (that is the Greek philosophical tradition). The Hebraic understanding is concerned with concrete existence, obedience, life-oriented wisdom, and the interrelationship of all things under God. Jesus's approach to discipleship is based on the idea that we need to change people's *behavior*, and their thinking will follow. We act our way into a new way of thinking, not think our way into a new way of acting.\n\nThis is why the institutional church's default approach — classroom teaching, passive consumption, intellectual assent — has produced generations of admirers of Jesus rather than followers. Admirers are hard to motivate and need to be constantly entertained. Only real followers will go the distance and make a lasting impact on the world.\n\n---\n\n## The Discipleship-First Reframe\n\nHere is the reframe that changes everything: if we fail in discipleship, the whole thing fails. There is no doubt — discipleship is a critical and strategic issue. The quality of the church's leadership is directly proportional to the quality of its discipleship. If we fail in the area of making disciples, we should not be surprised if we fail in leadership development. Discipleship is primary; leadership is always secondary.\n\nThis means that the crisis of leadership in the Western church is not fundamentally a leadership problem — it is a discipleship problem. If you cannot make disciples, you cannot reproduce leaders. If you cannot reproduce leaders, you cannot reproduce churches. The pipeline is sequential, and discipleship is the headwater.\n\nConsider the Methodist movement. John Wesley's genius was not primarily organizational — it was discipleship-structural. His classes and bands, his insistence on accountability and holiness, his expectation that every Methodist would be in a formational relationship — these were the engine of the movement. When, in the mid-1800s, Methodism in America traded circuit riders (lay people with rudimentary training who planted churches as they traveled) for seminary-trained professionals, the movement's stunning growth turned into trended decline. It has never recovered. The critical \"movement killers\" were introduced when discipleship became an optional extra rather than the foundational practice.\n\nThe early church catechumenate tells the same story from the positive side. In the church from around AD 100 to AD 300, seekers had to prove their adherence to Jesus and commitment to his Way before they were even allowed to hear the gospel, be baptized, and join the community. Catechumens were thoroughly assessed and then put through a rigorous discipleship process by a sponsor who would take them under his wing. These catechisms could go up to four years. The result? A movement that grew from 25,000 to 20 million in two centuries — not through mass evangelism but through deep, costly, life-on-life formation.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application: The Anti-Consumerist Discipline\n\nWe cannot talk about discipleship in the West without naming the elephant in the room: consumerism. I was trained as a marketer and advertiser before I came to Christ, and when I look at the power of consumerism in our lives, I have little doubt that it is the single greatest rival religion to Christianity operating in Western culture today.\n\nThe church growth movement, for all its contributions, taught us how to market and tailor the church to suit target audiences. By failing to intentionally focus on making disciples, we inadvertently cultivated religious consumerism. People became consumers of religious goods and services rather than disciples being formed into the image of Christ. The challenge is that the church is forced to compete with other invitations for our allegiance, and in the end can become just another vendor — with Jesus as the product and the Sunday service as the shopping experience.\n\nI believe the only way to challenge the insidiously idolatrous nature of consumerism is through becoming more and more like Jesus — in other words, through discipleship. There is no programmatic solution. There is no marketing fix. The answer is the ancient one: a community obsessed with forming people who embody the way of Jesus in every dimension of their lives.\n\nThe practical implications are concrete:\n\n**Lower the bar of how church is done and raise the bar of what it means to be a disciple.** This phrase, which I borrow from Neil Cole, captures the essential strategic shift. Stop making church attendance the measure of faithfulness. Start making Christlikeness the measure. Simplify your ecclesiology. Intensify your discipleship.\n\n**Act your way into a new way of thinking.** Stop waiting for people to understand before they obey. At Forge Mission Training Network, we built our entire system around action-learning discipleship — placing interns in environments of mission where the vast majority of their learning comes from \"having a go.\" The classroom follows the field, not the other way around.\n\n**Build multiplication into the DNA from the start.** A disciple who does not make disciples is an incomplete disciple. The pattern is Paul's: \"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 11:1). This creates a chain of imitation — Jesus to Paul to Timothy to faithful people who can teach others also. Every link in the chain is both a disciple and a disciple-maker.\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies: Where Discipleship Creates Movement\n\n### The Chinese Underground Church — Forced Simplicity\n\nWhen the Chinese church was stripped of professional clergy, institutional structures, and theological libraries, something remarkable emerged: ordinary believers began to disciple one another with extraordinary effectiveness. They had no curriculum except the gospel. They had no method except life-on-life obedience. And they multiplied at a rate that shames every resource-rich Western church model. The pattern is unmistakable: when discipleship becomes the irreplaceable practice — not an optional program — movements are born.\n\n### Neil Cole's Life Transformation Groups\n\nChurch Multiplication Associates developed a disarmingly simple discipleship system: groups of two or three who read large portions of Scripture together, confess sin, and hold one another accountable. No trained leader required. No building required. No budget required. Just the Word, the Spirit, and mutual submission. The result? Over 10,000 churches in a decade, in sixteen countries. The system works because it is simple enough for anyone to reproduce and demanding enough to produce genuine formation.\n\n### The Willow Creek REVEAL Study\n\nThankfully, the church growth movement has begun a serious self-assessment. Willow Creek's REVEAL study was a watershed moment: one of the most successful attractional churches in history looked at itself and said, \"We're good at getting decisions for Christ, but not so great at making disciples.\" This honest reckoning represents the beginning of a critical correction — the recognition that attendance, programs, and production quality cannot substitute for the irreplaceable, life-on-life practice of forming followers of Jesus.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: Disciple-Making and the mDNA System\n\nDisciple-making is perhaps the most critical element in the mDNA mix, because it involves the task of becoming more like our Founder, Jesus — of actually embodying what he was about. If we fail at this point, we are almost guaranteed to fail in all the others.\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Jesus Is Lord:** Discipleship is the lived response to the confession. A church that takes discipleship seriously is a church that takes Jesus and the gospel seriously. A church that does not take discipleship seriously is a church that does not take Jesus seriously. And a church that does not take Jesus seriously is not really a church at all.\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Disciples are sent people. The practice of following Jesus naturally moves outward — into neighborhoods, workplaces, and the margins of society. You cannot make missionaries without first making disciples, and you cannot sustain mission without ongoing formation.\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ APEST Culture:** Discipleship is the soil in which the fivefold gifts take root. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers do not emerge from leadership pipelines — they emerge from discipleship cultures where people are being formed into the fullness of Christ.\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Organic Systems:** Simple, reproducible discipleship is the engine of multiplication. If the initial model is not readily reproducible by the regular, \"nonprofessional\" Christian, it will not multiply. Complexity is the contraceptive of movement.\n\n**Disciple-Making ↔ Communitas:** Formation happens best in the context of shared risk and mission. Disciple-making is not a classroom exercise — it is a journey into liminal spaces where people discover who they are becoming by following Jesus into the unknown together.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Church That Jesus Built\n\nThe church that takes discipleship seriously is the church that Jesus built — and it is the only church that changes the world. Not the church with the biggest building. Not the church with the best music. Not the church with the most programs or the largest budget. The church that forms people who look like Jesus, and sends them to form others who look like Jesus, in an unbroken chain of imitation that stretches from the first century to the twenty-first.\n\nDisciple-making lies at the core of the church's mission; it is not an optional extra. It is not a committee responsibility. It is not something we outsource to a curriculum or a class. It is the irreplaceable, life-on-life, community-embedded, Spirit-empowered practice of becoming more like Jesus and helping others do the same.\n\nNext week, we explore the twin dynamic that takes discipleship into the world: the missional-incarnational impulse — going out and going deep. Because disciples are not formed in isolation. They are formed on the road, in the neighborhood, in the thick of incarnational engagement with the world Jesus came to redeem.\n\nThe question is not whether you believe in discipleship. The question is whether you are making disciples. And the question after that is whether the disciples you are making are making disciples.\n\nThat is where movement lives."

What does it feel like to realize you may be a terminal link rather than a transmitting one?\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Execute (25 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** This phase moves from reflection to concrete commitment. Every participant should leave with a specific, actionable next step.\n\n**Question:** Based on everything you have read, discussed, and experienced this week, what is the one concrete action you will take in the next seven days to move from admiring discipleship to practicing it? Be specific: Who will you invest in? What will you do differently? What will you stop doing?\n\n**Challenge:** If anyone has not yet begun a Life Transformation Group (Experiment 1), use this time to pair up and commit to starting one this week. The requirements are minimal: two or three people, Scripture, confession, accountability. No curriculum. No leader. No excuse.\n\n**Group Commitment:** Each person states their commitment aloud to the group. The group holds them accountable — not with guilt, but with the mutual expectation that disciples are made, not merely discussed.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Jesus (15 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** This phase recenters the conversation on Jesus himself — the one whose life we are imitating, the one whose lordship makes all of this possible.\n\n**Reading:** 1 Corinthians 11:1 — \"Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.\"\n\n**Reflection:** Paul could say this without arrogance because he meant it. His life was so oriented around Jesus that inviting others to imitate him was simply inviting them closer to Christ. What would it take for you to be able to say this — not as a claim to perfection, but as an honest invitation rooted in a life that is visibly, recognizably being formed by Jesus?\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray together — not for programs or strategies, but for the courage to be disciples who make disciples. Pray for the specific people each of you named in the Execute phase. Pray that the chain of imitation extends one more link this week."

If discipleship is about becoming like Jesus, then mission is about going where Jesus goes. And Jesus goes to the margins, the neighborhoods, the overlooked corners of the world that the institution has forgotten or never reached.\n\nHere is a question to carry with you: What happens when deeply formed disciples are sent into incarnational engagement with the world? What happens when the people you are making into followers of Jesus are not extracted from their context but embedded more deeply into it — as salt, as light, as the living presence of Christ in every sphere of society?\n\nThat question is the engine of every movement that has ever changed the world.

                  "_videoScript": "There is a question that has haunted the Western church for decades, and it is this: why, with all of our resources — the best buildings, the best music, the most talented communicators, the most sophisticated programs — why are we not reaching our culture? Why is the church in the West in sustained decline while the church in the global South, often with none of these advantages, is growing explosively?\n\nI believe the answer lies in a single word: sending. Or rather, the absence of it. The dominant model of church in the West is attractional — come to us, on our terms, in our building, at our scheduled time. And that model works for people who are already culturally adjacent to the church. But it has a fatal structural flaw: it does not reach anyone else. And in an increasingly post-Christian culture, \"anyone else\" is becoming almost everyone.\n\n**[CORE TEACHING — The Twin Impulse]**\n\nThis week we explore what I call the missional-incarnational impulse — and I was deliberate in combining those two words. They are like the opposing blades of a pair of scissors. The missional impulse describes the outward movement of the church as a sent people — how the gospel is \"sneezed\" into the world and grows virally as it extends over time and space. The incarnational impulse describes how the gospel is embedded deeply into a culture — how it takes root in the soil of a specific place, a specific people, and grows in ways that make sense within that context.\n\nTogether they result in both multiplication and transformation. Separate them and you get either superficial expansion or insular depth — but never movement.\n\nThis is not a strategy. It is rooted in the deepest theology of the faith. The missional impulse takes its cue from the Missio Dei — the mission of God. The incarnational impulse takes its cue from the incarnation of the Son of God. When God decided to reach his world, he did not send a memo. He did not launch a program. He moved into the neighborhood. The Word became flesh and blood and took up residence among us. If that is how God reaches the world, then that is how we must reach the world.\n\n**[THE STAKES — What the Attractional Model Costs]**\n\nHere is what the attractional model has cost us: within three to five years of a person becoming a Christian, they have no meaningful relationships with anyone outside the church. We have extracted people from the relational networks through which the gospel travels. We have turned the salt into a salt block — packed together, concentrated, impressive in our quantity — when Jesus called us to be salt shakers, embedded in the meal, bringing out the God-flavors of the earth.\n\nEach church is a pod of seeds, pregnant with other churches. By insisting people come to us and seeking to control the mission environment, we lock up the power of multiplication. We suppress the sneeze.\n\n**[PRACTICAL SIGNPOST — What This Week Demands]**\n\nThis week I want you to think about three practices that structure the incarnational life: proximity, frequency, and spontaneity.\n\nProximity means being physically present where people are — not commuting to mission but living it. Frequency means showing up often enough for trust to develop. And spontaneity means creating enough margin in your life for the unplanned encounter, the unexpected conversation, the Holy Spirit's interruption of your schedule.\n\nEmbracing proximity, frequency, and spontaneity is nothing less than integrating mission into the natural rhythms of everyday life. And I want to be clear: this does not require a budget. It does not require a building. It does not require a program. It requires a willingness to go where people are and stay long enough for something real to happen.\n\n**[CLOSE — The Sending]**\n\nJesus said to his disciples, \"As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.\" The Greek word is *kathos* — \"in the same manner.\" Not just \"go.\" But \"go the way I went.\" Into the neighborhood. Into the culture. Into the mess and beauty and pain of the world.\n\nThat is the impulse. Let's explore what it means to live it."

As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.\"\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nThe Greek word here is *kathos* — \"just as,\" \"in the same manner.\" Jesus is not merely saying, \"I am sending you.\" He is saying, *I am sending you in the same way the Father sent me.* And how did the Father send the Son? Not with a megaphone from a safe distance. Not with a marketing campaign. Not with an attractional event. The Father sent the Son into the neighborhood — into the mess, the complexity, the bodily reality of human existence. The Eternal moved into the neighborhood and took up residence among us. God's central method of reaching his world was incarnation. And Jesus tells his followers: your method must mirror mine. This is not a suggestion. It is a commission rooted in the deepest theology of the faith. If the Lord of all things chose to engage the world by entering it — by becoming one of us, by eating and drinking and sweating and dying among us — then we, his people, must follow in his footsteps. We must become incarnation-al.\n\n**Reflection:**\n1. When you hear \"I am sending you in the same way the Father sent me,\" what does that demand of your current posture — are you going out, or are you waiting for people to come to you?\n2. What would it mean for your community to take the *kathos* seriously — to mirror the manner of Jesus's sending, not just its content?\n\n**Prayer:**\n\nLord Jesus, you who left the glory of heaven to move into our neighborhood, who ate with sinners and touched lepers and wept at gravesides — send us the way the Father sent you. Not from a distance. Not through programs. Not with control. But in the flesh, in proximity, in the messy, relational, incarnational work of embedding your presence in every corner of the world you came to redeem. Give us the courage to go out and the humility to go deep. Amen."

We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nEugene Peterson renders this verse with devastating simplicity: \"The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood.\" That single image — God moving into the neighborhood — contains the entire logic of incarnational mission. God did not send a message. He did not broadcast from a distance. He did not establish a headquarters and invite the world to come to him. He relocated. He took up residence. He entered the daily rhythms of a particular place — eating, drinking, working, sweating, celebrating, grieving — and from within that embeddedness, he revealed the glory of God.\n\nThis is the pattern that qualifies everything we do. The incarnation is not merely a doctrine to be believed — it is a method to be followed. If God's central way of reaching his world was to incarnate himself in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be incarnational. Our method must mirror God's method.\n\nNotice the comprehensiveness: the Word became flesh. Not spirit. Not idea. Not principle. Flesh. The incarnation dignifies the material, the local, the bodily, the particular. God did not come as a general truth for all humanity. He came as a specific person in a specific neighborhood at a specific time. And that particularity is precisely what made the revelation universal. The most incarnational thing you can do is not to be everywhere in general. It is to be somewhere in particular — deeply, faithfully, and for the long haul.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. What would it mean for you to \"move into the neighborhood\" — not necessarily by relocating, but by reorienting your presence, your time, and your attention toward the people and places where God is already at work?\n2. Where in your life have you been broadcasting from a distance rather than embedding yourself in the daily rhythms of the people you are called to reach?"

The missional-incarnational impulse is the logical extension of the lordship confession into every domain of culture, geography, and human experience. A domesticated lordship — one confined to Sundays and sacred spaces — produces an attractional church that waits for the world to come to it. A comprehensive lordship — one that reaches into every corner of creation — produces a sent church that goes where Jesus goes. The question Christology asks is: who is Jesus? The answer mission gives is: he is the one who moved into the neighborhood. And so must we.\n\n---\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Disciple-Making**\n\nYou cannot make missionaries without first making disciples, and you cannot sustain mission without ongoing formation. These two elements are like inhaling and exhaling — mission without discipleship burns people out, while discipleship without mission turns inward and becomes self-serving. Last week we established that a disciple is someone who is becoming more like Jesus. This week we add: Jesus is a sent person. A disciple who is not sent is an incomplete disciple. The incarnational impulse depends entirely on having people who are being formed deeply enough to carry the gospel into unfamiliar territory without losing their center.\n\n---\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ APEST Culture**\n\nThe fivefold gifts are the functional expressions of the missional-incarnational impulse. Apostles pioneer new missional territory — they extend the gospel into unreached contexts. Prophets speak God's truth into the cultural realities that incarnational presence reveals. Evangelists draw people to Jesus in relational, incarnational settings — not through programs but through contagious lives. Shepherds nurture the communities that form around incarnational presence. Teachers ground the mission in the story of God so that contextual engagement does not drift into cultural captivity. Without APEST, the impulse has no differentiated workforce. Without the impulse, APEST has no mission to serve.\n\n---\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Organic Systems**\n\nEach church is a pod of seeds, each church pregnant with other churches. The missional-incarnational impulse is the mechanism by which the seeds are scattered — it is the wind that carries them into new soil. But seeds need organic, reproducible structures to take root. Without organic systems, the impulse has no vehicle for multiplication. Without the impulse, organic systems have no energy, no direction, no reason to reproduce. The two are inseparable: the impulse provides the sending; organic systems provide the scalable form.\n\n---\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Communitas**\n\nIncarnational mission is inherently liminal. When a community moves into a neighborhood, shares risk, enters unfamiliar cultural territory, and faces the unknown together, communitas is the natural result — the deepest form of bonding that occurs when people follow Jesus into danger together. The missional-incarnational impulse creates the conditions for communitas, and communitas provides the relational depth that sustains incarnational mission over the long haul. You cannot sustain presence in difficult places without the deep bonds that form when people share the journey. And you cannot form those bonds without going somewhere together."

We explored the twin dynamic of the missional-incarnational impulse — the outward movement of God's sent people and the deep embedding of the gospel into culture and context. We named the failure of the attractional model to reach beyond its cultural boundaries and the systematic extraction of new believers from the relational networks through which the gospel travels. We practiced proximity, frequency, and spontaneity as the rhythms of incarnational life.\n\nThe central insight is structural: movements do not grow by attracting people to a building. They grow by sending formed people into every neighborhood, workplace, and cultural context — as salt scattered in the meal, as seeds carried on the wind, as the living presence of Christ embedded in the fabric of daily life.\n\n## Commitment\n\nBefore you move on, name one thing that will be different about the next thirty days of your life because of what you have encountered this week:\n\n- **Where** will you be present that you were not present before?\n- **Who** will you know by name that you do not know yet?\n- **What** rhythm of proximity, frequency, and spontaneity will you build into the structure of your week?\n\nThe incarnational life is not a burst of missionary enthusiasm.

                  "reading": "Let me define the two impulses more precisely.\n\nThe missional impulse describes the outward-bound movement that urges the church to reach beyond itself to its immediate neighbors, often across cultures and class, and eventually to the whole world. It is how the gospel is \"sneezed\" into the world and grows exponentially — in a viral way — as it extends itself over time and space. It is the recognition, as the great missiologists have taught us, that it is not so much that the church has a mission as that the mission has a church. We are the result of God's missionary activity in the world. God sends his Son into the world. The Son sends the Spirit into the world. The Spirit sends the church into the world. There is a sending in the heart of God that we are caught up into.\n\nThe incarnational impulse describes how the gospel is embedded deeply into a culture. As the seed of the gospel falls on cultural soil, it takes root, and Christianity develops within that culture in ways that make sense within that culture. It is how Christianity is contextualized into cultures and subcultures anywhere and everywhere. If missional defines our being sent out into the world, then incarnational must define the way in which we engage the world.\n\nWhen the missional-incarnational impulse is placed alongside the other elements of mDNA at the epicenter of the church's self-understanding, it maintains the movemental impulse to partner with God in his redemption of the world. It creates the internal pressure outward into mission and downward into culture in incarnational engagement.\n\n---\n\n## The Incarnational Method: God Moved into the Neighborhood\n\nWhen we talk of the Incarnation with a capital \"I,\" we refer to that act of sublime love and humility whereby God takes it upon himself to enter into the depths of human existence so that reconciliation between God and humanity may be brought about. When God came into our world in and through Jesus, the Eternal moved into the neighborhood and took up residence among us. As Eugene Peterson so beautifully translates John 1:14: \"The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe incarnation not only qualifies God's acts in the world but must also qualify ours. If God's central way of reaching his world was to incarnate himself in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be incarnational.\n\nI have found it helpful to think about incarnational engagement through what I call the six dimensions — or \"six Ps\" — of incarnational practice:\n\n**Presence.** The fact that God was in the Nazarene neighborhood for thirty years and no one noticed should be profoundly disturbing to our assumptions about ministry. Jesus was present before he was public. If relationship is the key means in the transfer of the gospel, then we are our messages, and we cannot take ourselves out of the equation.\n\n**Proximity.** Jesus mixed with people from every level of society. He ate with Pharisees as well as tax collectors and prostitutes. Christians need to be in direct proximity to the host community, rather than expecting the community to move toward them.\n\n**Prevenience.** God does not limit his presence to baptized Christians — he is an unrelenting evangelist. He is always at work in his world, right in the thick of things, in sinful people's lives, including our own. Our task is to discern where God is already moving and join him there.\n\n**Powerlessness.** In seeking to act in a Christlike way, we cannot rely on normal forms of power to communicate the gospel but must take Jesus's model of servanthood. God takes the form of a servant and not that of someone who rules over us.\n\n**Passion.** This involves us personally in what my wife, Debra, calls \"the incarnation of the heart\" — a genuine love for the people and place where we are sent. Surely, loving a city requires that we feel its pain.\n\n**Proclamation.** The gospel invitation initiated in the ministry of Jesus remains alive and active to this very day. But proclamation flows from presence, proximity, and relationship — not the other way around.\n\n---\n\n## The Attractional Failure\n\nHere is where the dissonance needs to land: the dominant model of church in the West is not missional-incarnational. It is attractional. And the attractional model, for all its contributions, has a fatal structural flaw: it assumes people will come to us.\n\nThe attractional-evangelistic approach is effective within a narrow cultural distance — people who are already culturally adjacent to the church. But it fails beyond that range. The net effect of using attractional evangelism only is to unwittingly block the movement of God. We know from research that within three to five years of a person becoming a Christian, they will have no meaningful relationships with anyone outside the church. Attractional evangelism in missionary contexts results in extracting people from their previous relationships and cultural context. This is a big no-no if we are serious about initiating movements. The gospel travels along relational lines. Sever the relationships and we effectively stop the outward movement of the gospel into the broader culture.\n\nThe church growth movement taught us how to pack more people into buildings through better programming, better music, better marketing. But it did not teach us how to seed the gospel into every subculture and neighborhood. We became salt blocks — packed together, impressive in our concentration — when Jesus called us to be salt shakers, embedded in the meal, bringing out the God-flavors of the earth.\n\nEach unit of church can be conceived as a pod of seeds, each church pregnant with other churches. By insisting people come to us and seeking to control the mission environment, we lock up the power of multiplication. We suppress the \"sneeze\" by holding back the impulse to sneeze in the first place. To frustrate this impulse is to block the church's innate reproductive capacity.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application: Proximity, Frequency, Spontaneity\n\nThe incarnational life is structured around three core practices that are disarmingly simple and profoundly demanding:\n\n**Proximity.** Christians need to be in direct proximity to the host community. This may mean relocating. It may mean rethinking where you spend your time. It may mean — as InnerCHANGE's John Hayes discovered — that driving down to poor neighborhoods and moving into them are two very different propositions. Hayes had been driving in and out of people's lives for years, so he found an apartment and moved into the neighborhood — Minnie Street, Santa Ana, Orange County, California. His community now commits to spending eighty percent of their time in the local neighborhood.\n\n**Frequency.** Proximity locates you among people, but frequency builds the familiarity needed for authentic relationships. When I lived in Melbourne, I regularly took Ruby, my beloved boxer, for walks throughout the local area and subsequently developed a number of relationships with other dog owners. We would stop and chat while our dogs played and sniffed one another. It was ordinary. It was repeatable. And it was the relational soil in which incarnational mission grew.\n\n**Spontaneity.** Genuine relationships develop informally through unplanned and impromptu connections. But by definition, spontaneity does not occur without making space for it. If your calendar is so structured that there is no margin for the unexpected encounter, you have designed incarnation out of your life.\n\nEmbracing proximity, frequency, and spontaneity is nothing less than integrating mission into the natural rhythms of everyday life. It does not require a budget. It does not require a building. It requires a willingness to go where people are and stay long enough for trust to develop.\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies: Where the Impulse Takes Root\n\n### InnerCHANGE — Relocation as Mission\n\nWhen John Hayes moved into Minnie Street, he was making a theological statement with his address. His community of InnerCHANGE has since spread across multiple countries, always with the same commitment: incarnational presence among the poor. They do not commute to mission. They live it. The distinction is everything.\n\n### Lance Ford's Monday Night Football\n\nLance Ford in Louisville tried something absurdly simple: he created flyers inviting neighborhood men to watch Monday Night Football at his house. Six guys showed up. They kept coming for six years. One man named Jeff eventually came to faith through another friend — but told Lance: \"Your family had spoken volumes to him by the way we lived.\" Jeff pointed to the time Ford's family collected funds to repair a single mother's air-conditioning system, how they helped his family when his wife had a baby, and the fact that Lance had always treated him as a friend though he was far from Christ. No evangelistic presentation produced that transformation. Incarnational presence did.\n\n### Theology at the Bottleworks\n\nA group from Journey Church in St. Louis approached Schlafly Bottleworks brewery to host \"Theology at the Bottleworks\" — monthly discussions on poverty, global warming, race relations. They were vilified for not sharing the \"gospel message\" and heavily criticized for \"having church where beer is served.\" But they understood something their critics did not: the incarnational impulse moves the gospel into the spaces where people actually live, not the spaces where Christians are comfortable.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: The Missional-Incarnational Impulse and the mDNA System\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Jesus Is Lord:** If Jesus is Lord of all — not just the religious sector — then his people must go to all sectors. The missional-incarnational impulse is the logical extension of the lordship confession into every domain of culture and geography. A domesticated lordship produces an attractional church. A comprehensive lordship produces a sent church.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Disciple-Making:** You cannot make missionaries without first making disciples, and you cannot sustain mission without ongoing formation. Disciples are sent people. The practice of following Jesus naturally moves outward — into neighborhoods, workplaces, and the margins of society. Mission without discipleship burns people out. Discipleship without mission turns inward.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ APEST Culture:** The fivefold gifts are the functional expressions of the missional-incarnational impulse. Apostles pioneer new missional territory. Prophets speak God's truth into cultural contexts. Evangelists draw people to Jesus in incarnational settings. Shepherds nurture the community that forms around incarnational presence. Teachers ground the mission in the story of God.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Organic Systems:** The pod-of-seeds metaphor is organic: each church is pregnant with other churches. Missional-incarnational engagement is the mechanism by which the seeds are scattered. Without organic, reproducible structures, the impulse has no vehicle. Without the impulse, the structures have no energy.\n\n**Missional-Incarnational Impulse ↔ Communitas:** Incarnational mission is inherently liminal. When a community moves into a neighborhood, shares risk, enters unfamiliar cultural territory, and faces the unknown together, communitas is the natural result. The missional-incarnational impulse creates the conditions for the deepest form of community — not around shared comfort, but around shared mission.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Church That Goes\n\nThe church that Jesus built is not a church that waits for the world to come to it. It is a church that goes — out into the neighborhoods, deep into the cultures, across the boundaries that the institutional church has drawn around itself for protection. It goes because God goes. It incarnates because God incarnated. It enters the mess, the complexity, the beauty, and the pain of the world because that is exactly what Jesus did.\n\nThe question is not whether your community believes in mission. Every church I have ever encountered believes in mission — they have a missions committee to prove it. The question is whether your community is structured around the missional-incarnational impulse — whether going out and going deep is in your DNA, in your rhythms, in the daily patterns of how you live. Because if it is not, you are a salt block. And the world does not come to the salt. The salt goes to the meal.\n\nThat is the impulse. That is the sending. And that is how movements change the world."

What do you wish were different about the world?\n\nListen without correcting, without spiritualizing, without steering toward a gospel presentation. Simply hear them. Exegete their world the way you would exegete a biblical text — with curiosity, care, and the assumption that God is already at work in their story before you arrived.\n\nWe tend to exegete Scripture well while failing miserably at exegeting the culture in which we are immersed.

Where do you feel the tension between gratitude for what the attractional model gave you and recognition of what it cannot do?\n\n**Tension 2 — The Cost of Proximity:**\nThose who completed the Third Place Experiment (Exercise 2) or the Monday Night Football method (Experiment 1) — what happened? What did proximity cost you in terms of time, comfort, or control? What did it produce that a program could not?\n\n**Tension 3 — The Reversed Megaphone:**\nFor those who practiced the Reverse the Megaphone exercise (Exercise 3) — what did you learn by listening rather than speaking? What did you hear that surprised you? Where did you sense God already at work before you arrived?\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Execute (25 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** This phase translates reflection into concrete commitment. Every participant should leave with a specific incarnational practice they will begin or deepen.\n\n**Question:** Based on everything you have explored this week, identify one concrete incarnational practice you will commit to for the next thirty days. Not a program. Not an event. A sustainable rhythm of presence, proximity, and engagement in a specific place with specific people. Be precise: Where will you go? How often? Who will you seek to know?\n\n**Challenge:** If anyone identified through the Proximity Audit that they have no meaningful relational connections outside the faith community, name that honestly and choose one specific step to change it this week.\n\n**Group Accountability:** Each person states their commitment. The group agrees to check in next week on how it went — not with judgment, but with the shared conviction that the incarnational impulse is not something we discuss. It is something we live.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Jesus (15 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** This phase recenters on Jesus as the original incarnational missionary — the one whose method we are called to mirror.\n\n**Reading:** John 1:14 — \"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.\"\n\n**Reflection:** Jesus spent thirty years in an obscure neighborhood before anyone noticed anything remarkable. Thirty years of presence, proximity, and ordinary life. What does the patience of the incarnation say to our urgency to see results, to measure impact, to prove that our mission is working? What would it look like to trust the slow, hidden, incarnational work of simply being present?\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray for the neighborhoods each of you named. Pray for the specific people you encountered in your experiments this week. Pray for the courage to go out and the patience to go deep — and for the faith to believe that when we move into the neighborhood, Jesus moves with us. Amen."

If the missional-incarnational impulse sends us into the world, APEST tells us how we are equipped to engage it. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are not five leadership roles to be filled. They are five dimensions of Christ's own ministry, distributed across the whole body, for the maturation of the church.\n\nHere is a question to carry with you: What happens when a body amputates three of its five limbs and tries to function with only two? Because that is precisely what most Western churches have done — they have retained the shepherd and teacher functions while exiling the apostle, prophet, and evangelist. The result is a body that can care and instruct but cannot pioneer, challenge, or recruit. Next week, we explore what it would mean to recover the full fivefold."

                  "_videoScript": "How many times do you think the word \"pastor\" — shepherd — is used in the New Testament to describe people in ministry? Given how universal the term is, you would expect dozens of occurrences. The answer is completely astonishing: once. One time. Here, in Ephesians 4. And yet we have built the entire Western church's ministry architecture around this single word while systematically deleting the other four ministry types that appear alongside it in the same sentence.\n\nIf that does not create some productive dissonance, I am not sure what will.\n\n**[CORE TEACHING — The Five]**\n\nThis week we explore what I call APEST — apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher — the fivefold ministry system that Paul describes in Ephesians 4 as Christ's gift to the church. And I want to be clear about the scope of this text. Paul says in verse 7, \"To each one of us grace has been given.\" The Greek word is *hekasto* — it means every single person. This is not about a leadership elite. Every believer carries one of these five vocational intelligences, gifted by the ascended Christ, for the maturation of the whole body.\n\nThe purpose is stated explicitly: to equip God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and become mature — attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. That is the goal. Not organizational efficiency. Not numerical growth. The fullness of Christ.\n\nNow here is the diagnosis: the Christendom church has been run on a largely shepherd-teacher model for over sixteen centuries. By effectively exiling the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic ministries, we have meddled with the very mechanism Jesus intended for us to be a fully functioning body. And I want to be direct about this: as far as we can discern, it is simply not possible to be the church that Jesus intended if three of the five constitutional ministries are removed. According to the explicit teaching of Ephesians 4, it cannot be done.\n\n**[THE METAPHOR — Procrustes]**\n\nThere is a figure in Greek mythology named Procrustes who kept a house by the side of the road. He would invite travelers in for a meal and a night's rest in his special bed. But once the guest fell asleep, Procrustes went to work — stretching the guest on a rack if he was too short, or chopping off his legs if he was too long. This is what we have done with ministry. Having exiled three of the five types and defined ministry according to the remaining two, we have forced everyone into a bed that was never designed to fit them. The apostolically gifted person is told to sit still and teach. The prophet is told to keep the uncomfortable questions to herself. The evangelist is asked to calm down and join a committee. And then we wonder why the church lacks missional energy.\n\n**[THE STAKES — Why This Matters]**\n\nEvery observable, highly transformative apostolic movement has operated with some expression of fivefold ministry. Every single one. The Chinese underground church did it organically — under persecution, all five types emerged and functioned without anyone designing a leadership pipeline. Conversely, every movement that suppressed the full fivefold has stagnated.\n\nWe are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving. If the Western church is producing pastoral care and theological education but not pioneering mission, prophetic challenge, or evangelistic recruitment, that is not a failure of effort. It is a failure of design. We are running on two cylinders and wondering why the engine does not perform.\n\n**[SIGNPOST — What to Watch For]**\n\nThis week, I want you to pay attention to three things.\n\nFirst, notice the Christological basis. Each of the five APEST types is rooted in a dimension of Christ's own ministry. Jesus is the archetypal apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. To suppress any of the five is to suppress a dimension of Christ's presence in the world.\n\nSecond, notice what happens when any single type dominates. Pastoral monoculture produces risk-aversion. Teaching monoculture produces intellectualism. The answer is not finding the right dominant type — it is the system. All five, in dynamic relationship.\n\nThird, and this is the hope in the diagnosis: the seed is already planted. All five types are already present in your community. The question is whether your culture, your language, your structures allow all five to function.\n\n**[CLOSE — The Recovery]**\n\nWe are at the midpoint of this course. And I believe APEST is the hinge on which everything turns. Without the fivefold, you cannot sustain the missional-incarnational impulse. Without it, discipleship lacks the full spectrum of Christ's ministry. Without it, organic systems have no differentiated workforce. Without it, communitas lacks the creative friction that produces depth.\n\nIt is time to recover the full system. Let's explore what that looks like."

He is describing a distributed system in which every believer carries one of five vocational intelligences gifted by the ascended Christ. And notice the goal: not efficiency, not attendance, not organizational success — but *maturity,* *the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.* APEST exists for one purpose: to bring the body to the full stature of Jesus.\n\nNow ask yourself: what happens when a body amputates three of its five limbs? Because that is precisely what the Western church has done. By effectively exiling the apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic ministries, we have meddled with the very mechanism Jesus intended for us to be a fully functioning ecclesia. We have forced all ministry to fit into the predetermined formats of shepherd and teacher — and then wondered why the body is not reaching maturity. We are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving. And if what we are currently achieving is a church that can care and instruct but cannot pioneer, challenge, or recruit, then we have a design problem — and the design problem is that we have deleted three-fifths of the system Christ gave us.\n\n**Reflection:**\n1. If APEST is given to *every* believer, not just leaders, what does that imply about the people sitting in your community who have never been told they carry an apostolic, prophetic, or evangelistic calling?\n2. Where in your context do you see the consequences of running the church on only two of the five ministry types?\n\n**Prayer:**\n\nLord Jesus, you ascended and gave gifts to your church — not two, but five. You designed us for fullness, not reduction. Forgive us where we have exiled the apostolic, silenced the prophetic, and sidelined the evangelistic. Forgive us where we have forced your people into a bed that does not fit them and cut off what did not conform. Restore to us the full measure of what you gave. Make us a body that runs on all five cylinders — for your glory and for the maturation of your people. Amen."

Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nRead this passage slowly and notice the movement: from Christ's giving (v. 11) through equipping and building up (v. 12) toward a destination — maturity, the whole measure of the fullness of Christ (v. 13). This is not a description of church programming. It is a vision of the church becoming what it was designed to be — a fully mature body that represents the fullness of Jesus in the world.\n\nNow notice the mechanism: \"as each part does its work.\" Not some parts. Each part. The apostolic parts. The prophetic parts. The evangelistic parts. The shepherding parts. The teaching parts. When any part is suppressed, silenced, or exiled, the body cannot grow to maturity. It is like a body trying to function after amputation — it can compensate, it can adapt, but it can never reach its full capacity.\n\nThe text is weighty precisely because Paul intended it to be weighty. The language, grammar, theme, and proposed outcomes all indicate the sheer importance of what is being said. This is constitutional language. And the constitution has been violated for most of church history.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. As you read this passage, which of the five ministry types do you recognize in yourself? Which feels most foreign to you — and what does that gap tell you about the culture that formed you?\n2. The destination is \"the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\" If your community were honest, how far along that journey would you say you are — and what is missing that would move you closer?"

Each of the five types is rooted in a dimension of Christ's own ministry — he is the archetypal apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. When we confess Jesus as Lord (Week 1), we are confessing the lordship of someone whose ministry cannot be reduced to two categories. To suppress three of the five types is to suppress three dimensions of Christ's active presence in his church. A full confession demands a full expression. The lordship of Jesus is not abstract theology — it is operationalized through the fivefold ministry he gave to his people.\n\n---\n\n**APEST ↔ Disciple-Making**\n\nDiscipleship is the soil in which the fivefold gifts take root (Week 2). Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers do not emerge from leadership pipelines or seminary classrooms — they emerge from discipleship cultures where people are being formed into the fullness of Christ. If we are not making disciples, we will not discover or develop the full range of APEST callings. And if we are only making shepherd-type disciples, we will only reproduce shepherd-type ministry. The breadth of our discipleship determines the breadth of our ministry expression.\n\n---\n\n**APEST ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**\n\nThe fivefold gifts are the functional workforce of the missional-incarnational impulse (Week 3). Apostles pioneer new missional territory. Prophets speak God's truth into the cultural contexts that incarnational engagement reveals. Evangelists draw people to Jesus in relational, incarnational settings. Shepherds nurture the communities that form around incarnational presence. Teachers ground the mission in theological depth so that contextual engagement does not drift into syncretism. If we want a missional church, we must have a missional leadership system to drive it. Missional church is apostolic church — any talk about missional church that does not also legitimize apostolic ministry is doomed to frustration.\n\n---\n\n**APEST ↔ Organic Systems**\n\nAPEST is inherently organic and distributed (Week 5 preview). It is not an org chart — it is a living system embedded in the DNA of every believer. When we explore organic systems next week, you will see that the APEST model is naturally scalable: it works in a house church of twelve and in a network of thousands, because the genetic code is distributed, not concentrated. The seed is already planted. The question is whether the organizational soil allows it to grow.\n\n---\n\n**APEST ↔ Communitas**\n\nThe dynamic tension between different APEST types creates the conditions for communitas (Week 6 preview) — the deep community that forms when diverse people face shared challenges together. A team composed entirely of shepherds will be comfortable but unchallenged. A team that includes all five types will experience more friction, more uncomfortable questions, more creative tension — and ultimately deeper bonds forged in the crucible of shared mission. APEST diversity is not a problem to be managed. It is the mechanism through which the church discovers its full capacity."

The question is whether the culture allows them to flourish.\n\n## Midpoint Check\n\nWe are at the halfway mark of this course. Over four weeks, we have laid the foundation: Jesus as Lord, disciple-making as the strategic engine, the missional-incarnational impulse as the sending dynamic, and APEST as the ministry system. These four elements do not stand alone — they are deeply interconnected, each dependent on the others, each reinforcing the others when present and exposing gaps when absent.\n\nTake a moment to assess: What has shifted in your understanding?

Markus Barth calls this section of Ephesians \"the Constitution of the Church\" and considers verses 11 and 12 to be the means of operationalizing it. This is not a minor text. This is not a peripheral teaching. This is constitutional.\n\nThe structure of the passage resists arbitrary selection or reduction among the five. The verbs for \"given\" in verses 7 and 11 are aorist indicatives — adamant verbs with no room for subtle reinterpretation. All five APEST ministries come together under the power of the ruling verb. We cannot eliminate or downplay one of these ministries without undermining the legitimacy, significance, and vitality of the others.\n\nAnd the scope is universal. Paul says in verse 7, \"But to each one of us grace was given.\" *Hekasto* — literally, \"to each and every person.\" This means that every believer fits into the APEST typology. This is a deeply radicalizing text. APEST is not about a leadership elite. It is about the ministry of all believers. It is a part of the DNA of all God's people, making it a universal feature of all communities in Christ.\n\nHere is how the five function:\n\n**The apostle** is tasked with the overall vigor and extension of Christianity as a whole, primarily through direct mission and church planting. As the name itself suggests, it is the quintessentially missional ministry — \"sentness\" is written into it. *Apostello* means \"sent one.\"\n\n**The prophet** is called to maintain faithfulness to God among the people of God. Prophets are essentially guardians of the covenant relationship — they ask the uncomfortable questions about whether we are being true to who God called us to be.\n\n**The evangelist** is the recruiter to the cause, the naturally infectious person who is able to enlist people into the movement by transmitting the gospel.\n\n**The shepherd** (pastor) is called to nurture spiritual development, maintain communal health, and engender loving community among the people of God.\n\n**The teacher** mediates wisdom and understanding, bringing comprehensive knowledge of the revelation bequeathed to the church.\n\nAll five are dimensions of Christ's own ministry. Is Jesus an apostle? The sent one? Yes, clearly he is the archetypal apostle. Is he a prophet? Yes, and the greatest one. Is he the evangelist of evangelists? Yes. Shepherd? He calls himself that. Teacher? Of course. Jesus parses out the core elements of his ministry into five distinct categories and plants those ministries deep within the church. What we have here is the \"root-in-ization\" of charisma — the ministries of APEST are rooted in, and consequently extend, the original ministry of Christ.\n\nAnything less than a fivefold ministry is a misrepresentation of the ministry of Christ. And by consequence, it leads to a misrepresentation of Christ in the world.\n\n---\n\n## The Exile of the APEs\n\nHere is where the dissonance must land. The Christendom church has been run on a largely shepherd-teacher model, and because it has had a privileged position in society, it has been inclined to dispense with the more missional ministry types — apostle, prophet, and evangelist. By effectively exiling the APE types, we have meddled with the very mechanism Jesus intended for us to be a fully functioning ecclesia. The result is that all ministry has been forced to fit into the predetermined formats of shepherd and teacher, pastor and theologian, and nothing else has legitimacy.\n\nI want to use a metaphor from Greek mythology to describe what we have done. Procrustes was a villain who kept a house by the side of the road where he offered hospitality to passing strangers. The guests were invited in for a pleasant meal and a night's rest in his very special bed. But as soon as the guest fell asleep, Procrustes went to work — stretching the guest on a rack if he was too short for the bed, or chopping off his legs if he was too long. We have done this with ministry. Having exiled the APE types and having defined ministry according to the remaining two types, we have effectively practiced Procrustean theology — forcing everyone into a bed that was never designed to fit them.\n\nCalvin himself — a brilliant theologian — made the fateful decision explicit. He argued that apostles, prophets, and evangelists \"were not established in the church as permanent ones, but only for that time during which churches were to be erected where none existed before.\" With one theological stroke, three-fifths of the church's constitutional ministry was declared temporary and dispensable. And we have been living with the consequences ever since.\n\nThe result is a Sisyphean futility. Every time we seem to develop some semblance of movement and get the missional boulder up the hill, it rolls back down again. We wonder why. We try harder. We develop better strategies. But we never question the system itself — the system that runs on two cylinders and expects the performance of five.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application: What Each APEST Dysfunction Looks Like\n\nWhen any single APEST type dominates to the exclusion of the others, the result is predictably dysfunctional:\n\nWhen **apostolic** leadership dominates, the organization will tend to be hard-driving, autocratic, with lots of pressure for change and development, leaving wounded people in its wake.\n\nWhen **prophetic** leadership dominates, the organization will be one-dimensional, likely factious and sectarian, always critiquing but rarely building.\n\nWhen **evangelistic** leadership dominates, the organization will have an obsession with numerical growth — counting decisions but not making disciples.\n\nWhen **pastoral** leadership monopolizes — which is the default in most Western churches — the community will tend to be risk-averse, codependent, and needy, prioritizing comfort over mission.\n\nWhen **teachers** rule, the church will be ideological, controlling, and moralistic — long on information but short on transformation.\n\nThe answer is not to find the right single type. The answer is the system. The elegant solution is all five, in dynamic relationship, checking and balancing one another, each contributing what the others cannot provide. Culture eats strategy for breakfast — and the culture we need is an APEST culture, not a pastoral-teaching monoculture.\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies: Where APEST Creates Movement\n\n### The Chinese Underground Church — Full-Spectrum Ministry\n\nWhen the Chinese church was stripped of its institutions, its seminaries, and its professional clergy, something remarkable happened: all five ministry types emerged organically. Ordinary believers functioned apostolically — pioneering new expressions of church in hostile territory. Prophetic voices called the community to faithfulness under persecution. Evangelists recruited new believers through relational networks. Shepherds cared for communities under extraordinary duress. Teachers passed on the faith through oral tradition and memorized Scripture. No one had read Ephesians 4 in a seminary classroom. But the genetic code activated under pressure.\n\n### Mike Breen — From Megachurch to Multiplication\n\nMike Breen was leading one of the largest churches in England when God seemed to show him a different vision: not growth through addition — packing more people into worship services — but growth through multiplication — reproducing disciples who reproduce missional communities who reproduce churches. That shift was fundamentally an APEST shift. Breen moved from a shepherd-teacher model of ministry to an apostolic model, and the result was a movement that spanned continents.\n\n### Hirsch's Own Leadership Team at SMRC\n\nWhen I reconstructed our leadership team at South Melbourne Restoration Community around the APEST principle, the difference was immediate. We ensured that all five ministries were represented on the team, each heading up a corresponding ministry area. On any given issue, the apostolic person would present in light of the missional vision, the prophet would challenge everything and ask irritating questions about how God fit into the matter, the evangelist emphasized the need to bring people to faith, the shepherd raised concerns about people's wellbeing, and the teacher discerned the theological implications. The friction was sometimes intense — but the outcomes were incomparably richer than anything a monoculture leadership team could produce.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: APEST and the mDNA System\n\n**APEST ↔ Jesus Is Lord:** APEST is the Christological ministry system. Each of the five is rooted in a dimension of Christ's own ministry. To suppress any of the five is to suppress an aspect of Christ's presence in the world. A full confession of Jesus's lordship demands a full expression of his ministry through his people.\n\n**APEST ↔ Disciple-Making:** Discipleship is the soil in which the fivefold gifts take root. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers do not emerge from leadership pipelines — they emerge from discipleship cultures where people are being formed into the fullness of Christ. If we are not making disciples, we will not discover or develop the full range of APEST callings.\n\n**APEST ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** The fivefold gifts are the functional workforce of the missional-incarnational impulse. Apostles pioneer new territory. Prophets speak truth into cultural contexts. Evangelists draw people to Jesus relationally. Shepherds nurture incarnational communities. Teachers ground the mission in theological depth. Without APEST, the impulse has no differentiated capacity.\n\n**APEST ↔ Organic Systems:** APEST is an organic, distributed system — not a hierarchical org chart. When we explore organic systems next week, you will see that the APEST model is inherently scalable: it works in a house church of twelve and in a network of thousands, because it is built into the DNA of every believer, not concentrated in professional clergy.\n\n**APEST ↔ Communitas:** The dynamic tension between the five types creates the conditions for communitas — the deep bonding that occurs when different people with different gifts face shared challenges together. A team that includes all five APEST types will experience more conflict, more creative friction, and ultimately deeper community than a team of like-minded shepherds.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Seed Already Planted\n\nHere is the good news buried in this diagnosis: the seed is already planted. All five APEST types are already present in your community, by virtue of Christ's word. They are the latent genetic code of the system. The focus should not be on trying to generate the seed — it is on creating environments that will allow it to flourish. The apostles are in your pews, wondering why no one will let them pioneer. The prophets are in your small groups, suppressing the uncomfortable questions they feel compelled to ask. The evangelists are in your neighborhoods, naturally drawing people toward the good news, wondering why the church only values their gifts during outreach week.\n\nThe question is not whether your community has all five types. It does. The question is whether your culture — your language, your structures, your expectations, your definitions of legitimate ministry — allows all five to function. Because if your vocabulary of ministry only includes shepherd and teacher, then the apostles, prophets, and evangelists in your midst have been edited out of the story. And a body that runs on two cylinders when it was designed for five will never reach the destination Christ intended.\n\nIt is time to recover the full system. Not as an addition to what you are already doing. As a correction of what has been missing."

Where do you feel the weight of it — and where do you feel resistance to it?\n\n2. Consider your own vocational intelligence: which of the five APEST types resonates most deeply with how you are wired — not what you have been assigned to do, but what you are drawn to at the deepest level? Where have you seen that calling suppressed or misdirected by the culture around you?\n\n3. The Procrustes metaphor describes forcing people into a bed that does not fit them. Where have you seen this happen in ministry — people with apostolic, prophetic, or evangelistic gifts being squeezed into pastoral or teaching roles because those were the only roles available?\n\n4. \"We are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving.\" Apply this diagnostic to your own community: what is your community currently achieving, and what does that reveal about the ministry design that is producing those outcomes?\n\n5. The reading describes what happens when any single APEST type dominates. Which dysfunction do you recognize most clearly in your context — the risk-aversion of pastoral monopoly, the intellectualism of teaching monopoly, or something else? What would the corrective look like?\n\n6. If the fivefold types are given to *every* believer (not just leaders), how would your community need to change its language, structures, and expectations to recognize and release the full range of APEST callings among ordinary people?\n\n7. The word \"pastor\" appears exactly once in the New Testament as a descriptor for church leaders. Yet it has become the default, often exclusive, title for Christian ministry. What does this reveal about the theological choices that have shaped our ecclesiology — and what would it take to recover a broader vocabulary?\n\n8. At the midpoint of this course, take stock: how has your understanding of what the church is designed to be shifted over the past four weeks? What connections are you seeing between Jesus's lordship, discipleship, the missional-incarnational impulse, and the fivefold system?"

From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.\"\n\n**Reflection:** The destination is not organizational effectiveness. It is Christlikeness — \"the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\" Jesus is the apostle, the prophet, the evangelist, the shepherd, and the teacher. His ministry cannot be reduced. When we suppress any of the five, we are suppressing an aspect of Jesus himself. What would it look like for your community to represent the full Christ — not a reduced, domesticated version, but the complete, fivefold expression of his presence in the world?\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray for the recovery of the full fivefold in your community. Pray by name for the people you identified this week whose gifts need to be recognized and released. Pray for the courage to change the culture, not just the strategy. And pray that as each part does its work, the body grows up into Christ. Amen."

A starfish has no head. Its major organs are replicated throughout every arm. Cut a starfish in half and you do not get a dead starfish — you get two starfish. The Western church has been organized as a spider. Movements are organized as starfish.\n\nThat is the simplest way I can state the structural challenge we face this week.\n\n**[CORE TEACHING — The Logic of Life]**\n\nOver centuries, the church has been taken captive to an institutional way of organizing. When we think of church, we think of buildings, clergy, denominational templates, professional staff. But this is not how the original church manifested itself. *Ecclesia* is movement. We have allowed this word to mean something profoundly different from what it originally meant.\n\nThe images Jesus uses for the kingdom are overwhelmingly organic: seeds, vines, yeast, trees, fields, bodies. These are not decorative metaphors. They are operational descriptions. When Jesus says \"the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed,\" he is telling us how the kingdom actually works — from the inside out, through distributed life, through the logic of growth rather than the logic of control.\n\nAn organic systems approach seeks to structure the common life of the church around the rhythms and structures that mirror life itself. Every group of God's people has everything within them needed to adapt and thrive in any setting. The question is whether our structures release that potential or suppress it.\n\n**[THE DIAGNOSIS — Complexity as Contraceptive]**\n\nHere is the uncomfortable truth: complex attractional approaches have a contraceptive effect on the reproductive capacities of the church. It is extremely hard to reproduce a megachurch, precisely because the model depends on large buildings, charismatic leaders, large staff, and financial resources that ordinary people simply cannot replicate. The net effect is to marginalize most people from ministry and stifle genuine people movements.\n\nMovements thrive on simplicity, reproducibility, and scalability. If the initial model is not readily reproducible by the regular, nonprofessional Christian, then it will not be magically reproducible by them later. You must build multiplication into the DNA from the start.\n\nEvery seed has the full potential for a tree, and the tree the full potential of a forest. Every church — every believer — has the full potential of a movement. The question is whether we plant seeds or build monuments.\n\n**[CASE STUDIES — The Evidence]**\n\nThe Chinese underground church is the most dramatic illustration. When everything institutional was stripped away — buildings, clergy, seminaries, organizational structures — what remained was the irreducible DNA of the faith, distributed across millions of ordinary believers. And it multiplied from two million to over 120 million in sixty years. That is not addition. That is multiplication.\n\nEarly American Methodism tells the same story. Circuit riders — passionate lay disciples with rudimentary training — rode from town to town, planting churches as they went. Within decades, thirty percent of the American population was being discipled. Then the Methodists made a fateful decision: they required circuit riders to complete four years of seminary. The starfish became a spider. Methodism has never recovered.\n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: when you simplify, decentralize, and distribute the DNA, movements multiply. When you centralize, professionalize, and complexify, movements stall.\n\n**[SIGNPOST — What to Watch For]**\n\nThis week I want you to think about your own context through the organic lens. Is your community structured more like a spider or a starfish? Is your model reproducible by ordinary believers, or does it depend on professionals and resources that most people do not have? Are you adding or multiplying?\n\nAnd perhaps the most important question: what would it look like to think like a farmer rather than a CEO? To scatter seeds and trust the soil? To keep it simple enough that anyone can do it?\n\n**[CLOSE — The Seed]**\n\nJesus said the kingdom is like a man who scatters seed on the ground. Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows — though he does not know how. All by itself, the soil produces grain.\n\nAll by itself. That is the promise of organic systems. The life is in the seed. Our job is not to manufacture the growth. Our job is to scatter the seed and keep the structures simple enough for the life to flow.\n\nLet's explore what that means."

Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. All by itself the soil produces grain — first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\"\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nNotice what the farmer does not do. He does not manufacture the seed. He does not engineer the growth. He does not stay awake at night pulling the stalks upward. He scatters. He sleeps. And the soil produces grain — *all by itself.* The Greek word is *automatos* — from which we get \"automatic.\" The kingdom operates by the logic of life, not the logic of machines. When Jesus says \"the kingdom of God is like,\" he is not offering a nice metaphor. He is describing operational principles. The kingdom grows organically — from the inside out, seed to stalk to head to full kernel.\n\nThis has massive implications for how we structure the church. The institutional church has operated primarily from a machine metaphor — input, output, efficiency, control. But the images Jesus and the New Testament writers use are overwhelmingly organic: seeds, vines, bodies, yeast, trees, fields. These are not decorative. They are instructive. They tell us that the kingdom does not grow through centralized control but through distributed life. Structure cannot create life, but without it life cannot exist very long. The question is whether our structures serve the life — or smother it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n1. Where in your community's life do you see the machine metaphor at work — the assumption that more control produces more growth? What has been the fruit of that assumption?\n2. What would it look like to think like a farmer rather than a CEO — to scatter and trust, rather than engineer and control?\n\n**Prayer:**\n\nLord of the harvest, you who scatter seed with reckless generosity and trust the soil to do its work — forgive us where we have replaced your organic logic with our mechanical control. Teach us to think like farmers, not engineers. Give us the courage to plant simple, reproducible seeds and the faith to sleep while they grow. Remind us that the kingdom does not need our management — it needs our obedience. And when the harvest comes, let it be your harvest, not ours. Amen."

Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\"\n\nHe told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.\"\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nTwo parables. Two organic images. And the same structural principle: the kingdom does not grow through impressive beginnings but through the distributed, invisible, relentless logic of life.\n\nThe mustard seed is notable for its smallness — and for the disproportionate result that emerges from it. This is the fractal principle at work: the whole potential of the tree is contained in the seed. The whole potential of the forest is contained in the tree. Every seed has the full potential for a tree, and every tree the full potential of a forest. So too every believer has the full potential of a church, and every church the full potential of a movement. The architecture of the kingdom is not designed to impress at the beginning. It is designed to multiply.\n\nThe yeast is notable for its hiddenness — mixed into sixty pounds of flour, invisible, working from the inside. You cannot see yeast at work. You can only see its effects. This is how the gospel operates: not through centralized, visible, institutional control, but through distributed, invisible, organic transformation. The yeast does not conquer the dough from the outside. It permeates it from within.\n\nBoth images challenge the institutional imagination. We want impressive beginnings. God plants mustard seeds. We want visible control. God works like yeast. We want to build monuments. God scatters seeds.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. Where have you been looking for the kingdom in impressive, visible, institutional forms — and missing it in the small, hidden, organic work of God?\n2. If every seed has the full potential of a tree and every tree the full potential of a forest, what is the \"seed\" in your context — the simplest, most reproducible unit of life that contains the full DNA of the movement?"

                  "reading": "If Jesus is Lord of creation — if \"in him all things hold together\" — then the church should reflect the organic logic of the creation he sustains. The biblical images of the church are overwhelmingly organic: body, vine, seed, yeast, tree. These are not decorative metaphors. They describe the operational principles of the kingdom. Institutional captivity is, at root, a lordship problem. When we organize around human systems of control rather than around the life-giving patterns Jesus designed, we have displaced his lordship with our management. Organic structure is a confession of faith: we trust the seed more than the system.\n\n---\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Disciple-Making**\n\nSimple, reproducible discipleship is the engine of organic multiplication. The smallest unit of the movement — the fractal from which everything else grows — is the discipleship relationship: two or three people, the Word, mutual accountability, and the expectation of reproduction. If that unit is healthy and reproducible, everything else scales. If it is complex and dependent on professionals, nothing multiplies. This is why, as we explored in Week 2, movements build discipleship into the DNA from the start. The organic system runs on discipleship fuel.\n\n---\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**\n\nThe missional-incarnational impulse (Week 3) is the wind that carries the seeds. Organic systems are the seed design that allows multiplication to happen when the wind blows. Each church is a pod of seeds, pregnant with other churches. By insisting people come to us and seeking to control the mission environment, we lock up the power of multiplication. Organic structures allow the missional-incarnational impulse to do what it is designed to do: scatter the gospel into every neighborhood, culture, and context.\n\n---\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ APEST Culture**\n\nAPEST (Week 4) is inherently organic and distributed — it is embedded in the DNA of every believer, not concentrated in professional clergy. Organic structures allow the full fivefold to function at every level: from the smallest cell to the largest network. In a starfish organization, apostolic, prophetic, and evangelistic gifts are not sidelined — they are activated at every node. The organic system does not need a centralized leadership pipeline to produce APEST ministry. It needs a culture that recognizes and releases what Christ has already planted.\n\n---\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Communitas**\n\nOrganic systems create the conditions for communitas (Week 6 preview) by distributing risk, responsibility, and mission across the whole body. When the structure is simple enough for everyone to participate — not just consume — then everyone shares the adventure of following Jesus into the unknown. The bonds forged in shared mission are the strongest bonds the church knows. Institutional structures concentrate risk in professional leaders and insulate the rest of the community from the transformative challenge of the journey. Organic structures invite everyone in."

We explored the organic logic of the kingdom, the starfish-spider contrast, the contraceptive effect of complexity, and the fractal principle that the smallest unit contains the DNA of the whole. We traced the pattern through the Chinese underground church, early Methodism, and DCFI — and found the same truth repeated: when structures are simple, decentralized, and reproducible, movements multiply. When structures are complex, centralized, and professional, movements stall.\n\nThe central insight is architectural: we do not need more programs, more buildings, or more staff. We need simpler structures that serve the life rather than smothering it. Think farmer, not CEO. Think gardener, not technician. Plant seeds, not monuments.\n\n## Commitment\n\nBefore you move on, identify one concrete simplification:\n\n- **What will you remove** — one structure, program, or process that has become an end in itself rather than a means to the mission?\n- **What seed will you plant** — one simple, reproducible expression of community life that contains the full DNA and could multiply?\n- **What control will you release** — one area where you will trust the life in the seed more than your own management?\n\n## Blessing\n\nMay the God who designed seeds to grow while farmers sleep give you the courage to simplify, the faith to scatter, and the patience to wait. May your structures serve the life rather than replacing it. May the smallest unit of your community — two or three gathered in his name — contain the full potential of a movement.

                  "reading": "Organic descriptions of the church abound in Scripture. Images such as body, field, yeast, seeds, trees, and vines are plentiful. These images are not simply metaphors that help us describe a theological truth — they actually indicate the way the kingdom operates. When Jesus says \"the kingdom of God is like,\" he is describing operational principles of kingdom growth.\n\nAn organic, or living systems, approach seeks to structure the common life of an organization around the rhythms and structures that mirror life itself. In this approach we probe the nature of life and observe how living things organize themselves. From there we try to emulate as closely as possible this innate capacity of living systems to develop high levels of organization and adapt to varying conditions. This connects with the idea that every group of God's people has everything within them needed to adapt and thrive in any setting.\n\nThis is funded theologically by the doctrine of creation. The Scriptures teach that the Trinity was fully involved in the inception of the cosmos and the maintenance of all life. God is the source of all life. Christ is the organizing principle of creation. The Holy Spirit brooded over the chaos. To find a pattern of church closer to life is to find a pattern closer to how God actually designed things to work. It turns out that humble yeast has much to teach us about the inner workings of movement.\n\nI always tell would-be church planters: do not plant churches — plant movements. Because starting a movement involves an almost completely different agenda than planting a church. And the structural difference is everything.\n\n---\n\n## The Starfish Principle\n\nThe most helpful structural metaphor I know comes from the contrast between the starfish and the spider. Spiders have eight legs coming out of a central body, and they have a head with eight eyes. If you chop off the spider's head, it dies. At first glance, a starfish looks similar. But the similarities end there. The starfish does not have a head, and its central body is not in charge. The major organs are replicated throughout each and every arm. If you cut the starfish in half, it will not die — you will have two starfish. A starfish is basically a network of cells, with everything it needs to reproduce spread throughout the entire body.\n\nThe Western church has been organized as a spider — centralized leadership, centralized resources, centralized control. Cut off the senior pastor, and the whole organism is in crisis. Movements, by contrast, are organized as starfish — decentralized, networked, with the DNA replicated in every part. The Chinese underground church is a starfish. The early Methodist circuit riders were starfish. The early church in the book of Acts was a starfish.\n\nThe mission of God requires the seeding and reproduction of God's people in every culture and group. Each unit of church can be conceived as a pod of seeds, each church pregnant with other churches. By insisting people come to us and seeking to control the mission environment, we lock up the power of multiplication. It seems that we suppress the \"sneeze\" by holding back the impulse to sneeze in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## The Contraceptive Effect of Complexity\n\nHere is the diagnosis that should alarm every leader in the Western church: complex attractional approaches tend to have a contraceptive effect on the reproductive capacities of the church. They can stifle genuine people movements, because effective attractional church requires a professional concept of ministry with a lot of resources.\n\nIt is darn hard to reproduce a megachurch, precisely because the model depends on large buildings, multiple departments, charismatic leaders, large staffing, and financial resources that simply cannot be replicated by ordinary people. The net effect is to marginalize most people from ministry and stifle genuine people movements.\n\nThis is why movements thrive on simplicity, reproducibility, and scalability. If the initial model is not readily reproducible by the regular, \"nonprofessional\" Christian, then it will not be magically reproducible by them later. You must build multiplication into the DNA from the start. If you try to factor it in later, it is very difficult and unlikely to succeed.\n\nEvery seed has the full potential for a tree, and the tree the full potential of the forest. So too every church — indeed every believer — has the full potential of a movement in it. The question is whether the structure allows that potential to be released.\n\nStructures are needed, but they must be simple, reproducible, and internal rather than complex, centralized, and external. Think farmer, not CEO. Think gardener, not technician.\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies: Where Organic Systems Create Movement\n\n### The Chinese Underground Church — Forced Into Starfish\n\nAround 2005, my colleague Michael Frost met with leaders of the underground church who had been smuggled out of China. They were asked what they wanted people in the West to pray for. They asked for three things: first, that they would be allowed to meet in groups of more than twenty people — they were still restricted. Second, that they could meet in purpose-built buildings rather than homes, cafes, karaoke bars, and social clubs. Third, that they could develop formal theological education institutions where they could train leaders. Mike, himself a vice president of a seminary, said that in all good conscience he could not pray for those things. He realized that in many ways the Communist state was forcing the church to be exactly what it should be — simple, decentralized, reproducible, and massively effective.\n\n### DCFI — From Bible Study to Global Movement\n\nDCFI had its roots in a Bible study involving young people coming to faith. The leader had become increasingly frustrated with the cultural mismatch between the church and the emerging generation. He developed what he called \"an underground church model,\" structuring the community as a movement meeting in cells across the city. In 1980 there were twenty-five people meeting in one house church. By adopting organic, networked structures, it grew to about 2,500 believers meeting in over 125 cell groups, and eventually spread to Scotland, Brazil, Kenya, and New Zealand.\n\n### The Methodist Trajectory — From Starfish to Spider\n\nEarly American Methodism was a starfish. Circuit riders — passionate lay disciples with rudimentary training — rode from town to town, planting churches as they went. Within decades, Methodism claimed to be discipling over thirty percent of the American population. Then came the fateful decision: under pressure from more established denominations who mocked them for not knowing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Methodist leadership required circuit riders to complete four years of seminary training. The starfish was reorganized as a spider. Methodism in America has never regained a positive growth pattern after that decision.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application: Building Organic DNA\n\nWhat does this mean practically? Several things:\n\n**Begin with the end in mind.** Plant movements, not churches. If you want a movement, you must think of *ecclesia* beyond the idea of a single local church before you begin. Build discipleship, multiplication, and reproducibility into the initial design. Do not assume you can add it later.\n\n**Simplify ruthlessly.** Purpose and principle, clearly understood and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization. To the degree you hold purpose and principles in common, you can dispense with command and control. People will know how to behave in accordance with them, and they will do it in thousands of unimaginable, creative ways.\n\n**Think fractally.** When a simple triangle multiplies on itself, a pattern emerges. The whole is made up of the recursion of the smallest part. This is the fractal principle: the same DNA that operates at the level of two people in a discipleship relationship operates at the level of a house church, a network, a city movement. If the smallest unit is healthy, the whole system will be healthy.\n\n**Resist the institutionalizing impulse.** It seems to be one of the tragic fates of human existence that over time, organizations develop a life of their own and in some way become the cause rather than serving it. What started as a dynamic new outpouring becomes a nay-saying, political controller of human behavior. The movement-to-institution trajectory is not inevitable — but resisting it requires constant vigilance and a willingness to keep structures simple.\n\n**Aim for multiplication, not addition.** Consider the rice on the chessboard: one kernel on the first square, doubled on each subsequent square. By the sixty-fourth square, there is more rice than the world can harvest in a thousand years. That is the power of multiplication. The church of Jesus Christ should not merely be adding. It should be multiplying. Addition can never keep up with multiplication.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: Organic Systems and the mDNA System\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Jesus Is Lord:** If Jesus is the organizing principle of creation — if \"in him all things hold together\" — then the church should reflect the organic logic of the creation he sustains. Institutional captivity is, at root, a lordship problem: we have allowed human systems to displace Jesus's design.\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Disciple-Making:** Simple, reproducible discipleship is the engine of organic multiplication. The smallest unit of the movement is the discipleship relationship. If that unit is healthy and reproducible, everything else scales. If it is complex and dependent on professionals, nothing multiplies.\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** The missional-incarnational impulse is the wind that carries the seeds. Organic systems are the seed design that allows multiplication to happen when the wind blows. The pod-of-seeds metaphor captures it: each church is pregnant with other churches, ready to be scattered into new soil.\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ APEST Culture:** APEST is inherently organic and distributed. It is not an org chart — it is a living system embedded in the DNA of every believer. Organic structures allow the full fivefold to function at every level — from the smallest cell to the largest network.\n\n**Organic Systems ↔ Communitas:** Organic systems create the conditions for communitas by distributing risk, responsibility, and mission across the whole body rather than concentrating it in professional leadership. When everyone is a missionary, everyone shares the adventure — and the bonds forged in shared mission are the strongest bonds the church knows.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Mustard Seed Architecture\n\nJesus compared the kingdom to a mustard seed — the smallest of seeds that becomes the largest of garden plants. The architecture of the kingdom is not impressive at the outset. It is not designed to impress. It is designed to grow. And it grows not through centralized control but through the distributed life of God flowing through simple, reproducible, organic structures.\n\nThe question for your community is whether your structures serve the life or smother it. Are you a spider or a starfish? A supertanker or a speedboat? A machine or a garden? The answer determines whether you will add or multiply. And in a world where the harvest is ripe and the workers are few, multiplication is not optional. It is the architecture of faithfulness."

All by itself the soil produces grain.\"\n\n**Reflection:** \"All by itself.\" The Greek is *automatos.* Jesus is telling us that the kingdom has its own internal logic of growth — we do not manufacture it, we do not engineer it, we do not control it. We scatter and we trust. What would it look like to trust the internal life of the seed more than you trust your own organizational efforts? What would you have to let go of?\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray for the courage to simplify — to let go of structures that serve your comfort but stifle the life. Pray for the seeds that were planted this week. Pray for a farmer's patience and a gardener's trust. And pray that the kingdom grows — all by itself, in ways you do not yet understand. Amen."

Why do people who have survived a crisis together describe the experience as the most meaningful community they have ever known? And what does that tell us about the kind of community the church was designed to produce?\n\nThis week we explore the final element of the mDNA system — and in many ways the most provocative: communitas. Not community. Communitas. The distinction is everything.\n\n**[CORE TEACHING — Communitas Defined]**\n\nCommunitas is the type of community that develops in the context of danger, an ordeal, or an overwhelming task. It happens when, faced with such a challenge, the participants find each other in a new and deeper way. The social bonds are strengthened and restructured. Friends become comrades. Associates become partners bound together in common cause.\n\nThe anthropologist Victor Turner discovered this dynamic in his fieldwork among African tribes. His foundational example is the initiation rite: boys are taken from the safety of the village into the bush, where they face genuine danger, disorientation, and hardship together. During this liminal period — this threshold space between what was and what will be — they develop bonds that are qualitatively different from village community. They emerge not just as individuals who know each other, but as comrades who have been forged together.\n\nThere is a direct and indissoluble link between liminality and communitas — they are two sides of the same coin. You cannot have communitas without liminality. You cannot have deep, forged-in-fire community without shared risk, shared danger, shared ordeal.\n\n**[THE DIAGNOSIS — Pseudocommunity]**\n\nAnd here is the uncomfortable implication: when we seek to build community without the experience of liminality, all we end up with is the kind of pseudocommunity that pervades many churches. It is more like a support group than a communitas.\n\nI learned this painfully in my own ministry. The early years of the community I led in Melbourne were radically missional — exciting, focused, alive. But as the community attracted more established, middle-class Christians, something shifted. Safety replaced risk. Comfort replaced mission. And what we had was pleasant enough — but it was not communitas. We had shifted from \"the community for the world\" to \"the community for me.\"\n\nGordon Cosby, after sixty years of remarkable ministry, observed that no groups that came together around a non-missional purpose ever became missional. Only groups that set out to be missional got around to doing it. Mission is the organizing principle of communitas. Without it, community always turns inward.\n\n**[THE STAKES — Why This Matters]**\n\nEquilibrium is a precursor to death. When a living system is in a state of equilibrium, it is less responsive to changes around it. The Western church is profoundly nonadaptive because it is preoccupied with safety. But some things benefit from shocks — they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, disorder, and stressors. This is the concept of antifragility. And it describes the church at its best.\n\nThe early church was not formed by its programs. It was formed by persecution, shared meals in the shadow of empire, and the willingness to follow Jesus into dangerous places together. The Chinese underground church did not grow because it had better strategies. It grew because sustained liminality activated communitas — bonds so deep that no amount of state repression could break them.\n\n**[SIGNPOST — What to Watch For]**\n\nThis week, pay attention to the difference between community and communitas in your own experience. Where have you experienced the deepest bonds — in comfortable settings, or in challenging ones? Where have you been most alive, most connected to others, most aware of God's presence — in safety, or on the edge?\n\nAnd pay attention to the call that liminality makes on all of us: to leave the fish tank for the ocean. To move from settlers to tent dwellers. To follow Jesus not into a program but into an adventure.\n\n**[CLOSE — Ruined for the Ordinary]**\n\nA community in Ontario describes itself as \"ruined for the ordinary.\" That is the fruit of communitas. Once you have experienced it, comfortable fellowship feels thin by comparison.\n\nThe question is whether you are willing to be ruined. Let's find out."

                  "scripture": "**Scripture:** Hebrews 11:8–10, 13\n\nBy faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God... All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nThe writer of Hebrews pictures the Christian community on earth as living like Abraham — in tents, in the land of promise, as in a foreign land. Ecclesiologist Paul Minear observed that \"the church is by its very nature composed of tent dwellers.\" Not settlers. Not homeowners. Tent dwellers. People who are perpetually on the move, perpetually in transition, perpetually in that liminal space between promise and fulfillment, between the already and the not yet.\n\nThis is profoundly unsettling for those of us shaped by middle-class Western culture, where safety, security, comfort, and predictability are the highest values. But the most theologically fertile sections of Scripture — the patriarchal narratives, the exodus, the exile, the prophets, the Gospels, Acts — were all forged in conditions of liminality. The settled periods are precisely when Israel and the church lose faithfulness. The deepest community the church has ever known was formed not in safety but in shared danger, shared mission, and shared dependence on God.\n\n**Reflection:**\n1. Where has your community settled into safety and predictability — and what has been lost in that settling?\n2. What would it mean to live as \"tent dwellers\" rather than settlers — people whose deepest bonds are forged in the shared journey rather than in shared comfort?\n\n**Prayer:**\n\nLord of the journey, you called Abraham out of security and into the unknown, and from that liminal journey you built a people. Call us out again. Disturb our equilibrium. Break us free from the comfortable pseudocommunity we have mistaken for the real thing. Give us the courage to follow you into the dangerous, disorienting, beautiful terrain where true community — communitas — is born. We want to be tent dwellers, not settlers. Pilgrims, not consumers. Your people, on the move with you. Amen."

I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea. I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.\n\n**Teaching:**\n\nWhippings, beatings, imprisonment, and shipwrecks can hardly be called \"safe, secure, comfortable, and convenient.\" Yet through these experiences, Paul and his apostolic band totally realigned the course of history around the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is not the resume of a comfortable community leader. This is the testimony of a man living in sustained liminality — and the communitas he formed with his companions along the way was so deep that its effects are still reverberating two thousand years later.\n\nPaul's extraordinary courage flowed from a simple source: he had already lost his life for Jesus's sake. \"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.\" When you have truly lost your life, you are free from the loss aversion that keeps most people tethered to safety. Paul was not risk-tolerant — he was loss-free. He had nothing left to lose, and therefore everything to give.\n\nThis is the kind of life that produces communitas. Not a life organized around self-protection, but a life poured out in mission — where the danger is real, the stakes are high, and the bonds forged in the crucible are unbreakable.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. Paul's catalogue of sufferings is also a catalogue of communitas — shared danger that produced the deepest bonds. Where in your life has suffering or risk produced the deepest relationships? What does that tell you about how community actually forms?\n2. Paul says \"to live is Christ and to die is gain.\" What would need to shift in your heart for that to move from a theological statement to a lived reality — and what would that freedom do to your capacity for communitas?"

In a world that confesses other lords — money, power, comfort, security — to declare Jesus as the organizing center of all reality is to step onto a threshold. Communitas is the community that forms among those who have taken that step together and discovered that the threshold is where Jesus meets them. The lordship of Jesus does not produce comfortable religion. It produces a pilgrim people on the move — tent dwellers, not settlers.\n\n---\n\n**Communitas ↔ Disciple-Making**\n\nThe deepest formation happens not in classrooms but in crucibles. Discipleship accelerates under conditions of liminality — when people are stretched beyond their comfort, forced to depend on Jesus and on one another in ways that safety never demands. This is why movements that practice life-on-life discipleship in the context of shared mission produce deeper disciples than those that practice discipleship in the context of classroom instruction. Communitas is the relational environment in which the most transformative discipleship occurs.\n\n---\n\n**Communitas ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse**\n\nIncarnational mission is inherently liminal. When a community moves into a neighborhood, crosses cultural boundaries, enters unfamiliar territory, and faces the unknown together, communitas is the natural result. The missional-incarnational impulse creates the conditions communitas requires, and communitas provides the relational depth that sustains incarnational mission over the long haul. You cannot stay in difficult places without deep bonds. And you cannot form deep bonds without going to difficult places together.\n\n---\n\n**Communitas ↔ APEST Culture**\n\nThe dynamic tension between diverse APEST types — the friction between apostolic drive and pastoral care, between prophetic challenge and teaching stability, between evangelistic urgency and shepherding patience — creates the conditions for communitas when that tension is held in the context of shared mission. Homogeneity is comfortable but shallow. Diversity under pressure produces depth. A team that includes all five APEST types facing a shared challenge will experience the creative friction that forges the deepest bonds.\n\n---\n\n**Communitas ↔ Organic Systems**\n\nOrganic systems distribute risk and mission across the whole body rather than concentrating them in professional leadership. When the structure is simple enough for everyone to participate — not just consume — then everyone shares the adventure. Institutional structures insulate the majority from the transformative challenge of the journey. Organic structures invite everyone in. And when everyone is in — when the whole body is on the move together — communitas becomes possible at every level, from the smallest cell to the largest network."

We distinguished communitas from the pseudocommunity that pervades most Western churches and traced the link between liminality and genuine bonding through Turner's anthropological work, the African initiation rite, and the biblical narrative. We named the middle-class \"bugs in the software\" that undermine communitas and the organizing principle that produces it: mission, not comfort.\n\nThe central insight is relational: the community we long for — the depth of connection we sense is missing — cannot be produced by pursuing community directly. It can only be produced by pursuing mission together in conditions that require genuine faith, genuine risk, and genuine dependence on God and one another.\n\n## Commitment\n\nYou have now encountered all six elements of mDNA. Before moving into integration and synthesis, name one commitment that is specifically about the quality of community in your life:\n\n- **What shared ordeal** will you enter with others — not a retreat from the world, but an advance into it?\n- **What safety** will you release — what comfort will you trade for the deeper bonds that only liminality produces?\n- **Who** will you invite into the liminal space with you — who needs to be ruined for the ordinary alongside you?\n\n## Blessing\n\nMay the God who called Abraham out of security and Moses through the sea and the disciples into the upper room call you into the liminal space where communitas is born. May you discover that the threshold is not a place of loss but a place of finding — finding each other, finding yourself, finding God in ways that safety never permits. May the bonds forged in this course become the bonds of comrades, not merely acquaintances. And may you be ruined for the ordinary — forever dissatisfied with pseudocommunity, forever longing for the real thing, forever willing to follow Jesus into the unknown to find it. Amen."

                  "reading": "Let me define the terms precisely, because precision matters here.\n\n**Liminality** applies to the situation where people find themselves in an in-between, marginal state in relation to the surrounding society — a place that could involve significant danger and disorientation, but not necessarily so. The word comes from the Latin *limen*, meaning \"threshold.\" It is the space between what was and what will be — the space of transition, uncertainty, and possibility.\n\n**Communitas** is the type of community that develops in the context of danger, an ordeal, or an overwhelming task. It happens when, faced with such a challenge, the participants \"find each other\" in a new and deeper way. The social bonds are strengthened and restructured. Friends become comrades. Associates become partners bound together in common cause.\n\nThere is a direct and indissoluble link between liminality and communitas — they are two sides of the same coin. We cannot have one without the other. Communitas does not emerge from comfort, stability, or safety. It emerges from the shared experience of the threshold — the shared ordeal, the common challenge, the journey into the unknown undertaken together.\n\n---\n\n## The African Initiation Rite: The Foundational Illustration\n\nThe anthropologist Victor Turner, whose work forms the academic foundation for this element of mDNA, did his fieldwork among African tribes. His foundational illustration is the initiation rite: boys are kept under the care of women until age thirteen. At the appropriate time, men sneak into the village at night and \"kidnap\" the boys. They are blindfolded, roughed up, herded into the bush, circumcised, and left to fend for themselves for up to six months. Once a month, elders visit to debrief and mentor them. During this liminal period, the boys undergo a profound transformation — they move from disorientation and individualism to developing a deep bond of comradeship. If they emerge, they are reintroduced to the tribe as men.\n\nThe rite works because it is genuinely liminal — genuinely disorienting, genuinely dangerous, and genuinely shared. The community that forms in the bush is qualitatively different from the community of the village. It is communitas — bonds forged in the crucible of shared ordeal.\n\n---\n\n## Why the Western Church Settles for Pseudocommunity\n\nHere is the uncomfortable truth: when we seek to build community without the experience of liminality, all we end up with is the kind of pseudocommunity that pervades many churches. It is more like a support group than a communitas.\n\nI came to this realization through painful personal experience. The early years of the community I led at South Melbourne Restoration Community were radically missional — the community was focused, sharpened, and something wonderful was forming. But as the community became more established and attracted more middle-class Christians from the suburbs, something shifted. We became more stable, but what was most significant was inadvertently lost as the church culture changed. I came to the conclusion that there must be something about middle-class culture that works against the radical claims of faith — that safety, security, comfort, and consumerism function like bugs in the software, undermining communitas from the inside. The community shifted from \"the community for the world\" to \"the community for me.\"\n\nThis is not unique to one church. It is the structural tendency of every community that prioritizes safety over mission. Gordon Cosby, the pioneering leader of Church of the Saviour in Washington, DC, observed after over sixty years of significant ministry that no groups that came together around a non-missional purpose ever became missional. Only groups that set out to be missional actually got around to doing it. Mission is the organizing principle of communitas. Without it, community turns inward and eventually becomes a vendor of relational services — competing for the attention of spiritual consumers.\n\n---\n\n## The Biblical Case: Liminality as Normative\n\nSome have proposed that liminality is merely transitional — a phase the church passes through on its way to something more stable. I must say that I have not fundamentally changed my conviction: liminality and communitas are much more the normative situation and condition for the people of God.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming. Survey the Scriptures and you will find that the most theologically fertile sections were formed in times of extremity. The patriarchs lived as tent-dwelling strangers. The exodus forged Israel's identity in the wilderness. The exile produced the prophets' deepest theology. The Gospels narrate a liminal movement led by a homeless rabbi. Acts describes a community forged in persecution. Paul's extraordinary letters were written from prison cells and shipwrecks. These are not safe little bedtime stories — they call us to a dangerous form of faithfulness.\n\nThe settled periods — the monarchy, the post-Constantinian church, the comfortable Christendom establishment — are precisely the periods when God's people lose their edge, their faithfulness, and their mission. When the people of God settled down and \"forgot YHWH,\" the prophets had to spiritually disturb them, recalling the dangerous memories about fires on the mountain and pursuing armies. Equilibrium, it turns out, is a precursor to death. When a living system is in a state of equilibrium, it is less responsive to changes occurring around it.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application: Creating Conditions for Communitas\n\nYou cannot manufacture communitas. But you can create the conditions under which it emerges. Several principles:\n\n**Organize around mission, not ministry.** Ministry is the means by which we accomplish mission, but mission must be the organizing principle. Groups that form around shared comfort — Bible studies, fellowship dinners, affinity groups — rarely develop communitas. Groups that form around shared mission — incarnational engagement in a neighborhood, a justice initiative, a church plant in a hard place — discover communitas as a byproduct of the journey.\n\n**Embrace the edge of chaos.** From living systems theory: the church is at its innovative best near the edge of chaos. The edge of chaos is a condition, not a location. It is a permeable, intermediate state where productive agitation runs high and innovation thrives. The Western church is profoundly nonadaptive because it is preoccupied with safety. Depriving systems of vital stressors is not a good thing. Some things benefit from shocks — they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors.\n\n**Put people at risk.** When we started Forge Mission Training Network, we recognized the desperate need for entrepreneurial gifting. So we developed a philosophy of education that put our interns \"at risk.\" If they are standing within their current realm of expertise, they are only going to learn what they already know. So the learners take one step out of their comfort zone, closer to the edge of chaos, and then another half step so they are \"at risk\" of real failure. That risk is where formation happens.\n\n**Cast a vision that creates liminality.** A vigorous transformative vision can itself create liminality. Holding a definite vision of the future alters how people think and behave in the present. Kennedy's moonwalk vision gathered disparate motivations into unified action. The \"already and not yet\" tension of the kingdom of God functions as a \"strange attractor\" that keeps the church moving forward. Managing from the future is one of the most powerful tools for generating the conditions of communitas.\n\n---\n\n## Case Studies: Where Communitas Transforms\n\n### The Chinese Underground Church — Sustained Liminality\n\nThe Chinese underground church and the early church are the two phenomenal Jesus movements that most clearly demonstrate sustained liminality-communitas. Both experienced long-term persecution and were outlawed. Both grew explosively — not despite the danger, but through it. The bonds that formed under persecution were incomparably deeper than anything produced by comfortable church programming. This is communitas at its most powerful — not a weekend retreat, but a sustained way of life under pressure.\n\n### Mark Scandrette's Mural Art Co-op\n\nMark Scandrette, an urban missionary in San Francisco, initiated a mural art co-op. The co-op gathers to paint walls throughout the city — largely non-Christian people. They secure a wall, gather as a collective to decide what to communicate, divide up sections, and spend Saturdays painting, chatting, and sharing lunch. By the end — up to three months — they have delved deeply into one another's lives and explored themes of life, God, and spirituality. The shared creative ordeal — the challenge of producing something together — created the conditions for communitas in an entirely non-religious context.\n\n### The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nTolkien understood this instinctively. The Fellowship of the Ring becomes a real fellowship only as it undergoes struggle and hardship. The unlikely group — elf, dwarf, hobbits, humans, wizard — discovers one another in ways impossible in normal circumstances. In the Return of the King, the four hobbits share a long, knowing look in the pub after everything they have been through — no words can express what they are thinking, but they know each other's thoughts. This is the community found only in communitas.\n\n---\n\n## Integration: Communitas and the mDNA System\n\n**Communitas ↔ Jesus Is Lord:** The confession of Jesus's lordship is itself a liminal act in a world that confesses other lords. To say \"Jesus is Lord\" and mean it is to step into a threshold space — marginal, countercultural, and potentially costly. Communitas is the community that forms among those who have taken that step together.\n\n**Communitas ↔ Disciple-Making:** Formation happens best in the context of shared risk and mission. Disciple-making is not a classroom exercise — it is a journey into liminal spaces where people discover who they are becoming by following Jesus into the unknown together. The deepest discipleship happens on the edge, not in the center.\n\n**Communitas ↔ Missional-Incarnational Impulse:** Incarnational mission is inherently liminal. When a community moves into a neighborhood, enters unfamiliar cultural territory, and faces the unknown together, communitas is the natural result. The missional-incarnational impulse creates the very conditions communitas requires.\n\n**Communitas ↔ APEST Culture:** The dynamic tension between different APEST types creates friction — and friction, in the right context, produces communitas. A team of diverse gifts facing a shared challenge will experience deeper bonding than a homogeneous group in comfortable agreement.\n\n**Communitas ↔ Organic Systems:** Organic systems distribute risk and mission across the whole body rather than concentrating it in professional leadership. When everyone participates in the adventure — not just consumes — communitas becomes possible at every level of the system, from the smallest cell to the largest network.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Ruined for the Ordinary\n\nThere is a community in Uxbridge, Ontario, called the Winking Circle. It started with one family and some local kids who took over a condemned house. They customized bikes into eccentric art machines, started bands, designed clothes, organized shows, built skate ramps. Ramps were burned by vandals. Their dream ramp was sawn in half. But the community persisted — and its members were, as they say, \"ruined for the ordinary.\"\n\nThat phrase captures the fruit of communitas: you cannot go back. Once you have experienced the depth of community that forms in the crucible of shared mission — the bonds forged when you follow Jesus into the unknown together — ordinary community feels thin by comparison. Comfortable fellowship feels like a fish tank when you have swum in the ocean.\n\nThe question is whether you are willing to leave the tank. The journey is liminal. The destination is communitas. And it is the only community that changes the world."

What would a productive disturbance look like?\n\n5. The reading says that no groups formed around non-missional purposes ever became missional. Only groups that set out to be missional got around to doing it. If that is true, what does it say about the Bible studies, fellowship groups, and social gatherings that make up most of your community's relational life?\n\n6. Turner's African initiation rite illustrates how liminality produces transformation and bonding. What is the equivalent in your context — what shared ordeal or threshold experience could your community undergo that would produce genuine communitas?\n\n7. Paul's catalogue of sufferings in 2 Corinthians 11 is also a catalogue of communitas. His extraordinary courage came from having already lost his life for Jesus's sake. What are you still holding on to — what loss are you still afraid of — that prevents you from the freedom Paul describes?\n\n8. The Winking Circle community in Ontario was \"ruined for the ordinary.\" Have you ever been ruined for the ordinary — and if so, what produced that experience? If not, what is keeping you in the ordinary?"

Not abstract fears — concrete ones. What specific things (comfort, reputation, financial security, relational approval, control) are you holding onto that prevent you from stepping into the liminal space where communitas is born?\n\nFor each item, ask: what would it look like to \"lose\" this for Jesus's sake? Not recklessly, but faithfully — trusting that whoever loses their life for his sake will find it?\n\n**Output:** A private written inventory (not for sharing unless you choose to).

As the final core module, the execution should be both specific to communitas and integrative of the whole course.\n\n**Question 1 (Communitas-specific):** What is one concrete step you will take in the next two weeks to create the conditions for communitas in your community — not pseudocommunity, but the real thing? Be specific: what shared ordeal, what mission-oriented challenge, what liminal experience will you introduce?\n\n**Question 2 (Course integration):** You have now explored all six mDNA elements.

And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\"\n\n**Reflection:** Jesus is the pioneer — the one who went first into the liminal space, who endured the cross, and who invites us to follow. The great cloud of witnesses from Hebrews 11 — Abraham, Moses, Rahab, the prophets — are all people who lived in liminality and discovered God there. We are not alone. We are surrounded by those who went before us into the unknown and found it to be holy ground.\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray for the courage to leave the fish tank for the ocean. Pray for the specific commitments each person named. Pray for the community itself — that these six weeks have begun to form the bonds of communitas, not just the familiarity of community. And pray that as the course moves into integration and synthesis, the full mDNA system takes root — not as a theory, but as a way of life. Amen."

                  "reading": "I want to return to a story I told at the beginning of this course — the story of The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy and her companions travel to the Emerald City seeking what they believe they lack: brains, heart, courage, and a way home. After surviving dangerous encounters and overcoming the source of evil, they discover that they already had what they were looking for — they had it all along. The Scarecrow was clever all along. The Tin Man had real heart. The Lion was brave. And Dorothy had the capacity to return home in her ruby slippers from the very beginning.\n\nThis story highlights the central assumption of everything we have explored: all God's people carry within themselves the same potencies that energized the early Christian movement and the Chinese underground church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in you, me, and every local church that seeks to follow Jesus faithfully in any time. We have simply forgotten how to access and trigger it.\n\nThe most amazing thing we learn from the Chinese experience — along with every other apostolic movement in history — is that the church Jesus started already has everything in it to get its job done. Ecclesia is perfectly designed to fulfill its mission and purpose. What is more, every believer — and by extension, every believing community of Christ — has the same full potential for world transformation present in even the smallest part. Apostolic Genius is latent within the ecclesia, and given the right conditions, it can be reactivated and can transform the church into a potent movement of the gospel.\n\n---\n\n## The System in Motion: How the Six Elements Interact\n\nLet me trace the system dynamics one final time, because seeing the connections is essential to activating the whole.\n\n**Jesus Is Lord** is not merely the first element. It is the organizing principle — the center around which the entire system orients. When the lordship of Jesus is truly confessed and lived, it creates the conditions for everything else: the urgency to make disciples, the impulse to go into the world, the recognition that all five ministry gifts are needed, the commitment to simple structures, and the willingness to face risk together.\n\n**Disciple-Making** is the engine. Movements grow only in proportion to their capacity to make disciples. If discipleship is healthy, it produces the people who carry the mDNA into every other domain. Without disciples, there is no one to send, no one to express the fivefold gifts, no one to multiply, no one to share the liminal journey.\n\n**The Missional-Incarnational Impulse** is the sending dynamic — the outward and downward movement that takes formed disciples into the world. It provides the direction and energy that prevent the system from turning inward.\n\n**APEST Culture** is the ministry system — the differentiated workforce that ensures the full range of Christ's ministry is expressed through his people. Without it, the impulse has no differentiated capacity; the community cannot pioneer, challenge, recruit, care, and teach simultaneously.\n\n**Organic Systems** provide the architecture — simple, reproducible, fractal structures that allow the movement to scale without losing its DNA. Without them, the movement has energy but no vehicle for multiplication.\n\n**Communitas** is the relational fruit — the deep bonds forged when people follow Jesus into liminal territory together. Without it, the movement has structure but no soul, strategy but no depth.\n\nWhen all six are active — when the system is functioning as an integrated whole — something qualitatively different emerges. It is not merely the sum of six good ideas. It is an emergent phenomenon: Apostolic Genius. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n---\n\n## The Diagnostic: Where Is Your System?\n\nPlease note: I do not mean to suggest some sort of ecclesiological \"technique\" or church methodology here. Apostolic Genius is a mindset, an approach, a phenomenon, a way of thinking and doing church. There are internal checks and balances within it to keep it from degenerating into a mere technique. Commitment to Jesus's kingdom at the heart of the church — together with the willingness to become more like him — ensures the spiritual health of the movement.\n\nBut a diagnostic is still useful. For each of the six elements, assess your community honestly:\n\n| Element | Active? | Evidence |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Jesus Is Lord** — Is his lordship the functional center, not just a doctrinal affirmation? | | |\n| **Disciple-Making** — Are you actively forming reproducing followers of Jesus? | | |\n| **Missional-Incarnational Impulse** — Are you going out and going deep into culture? | | |\n| **APEST Culture** — Are all five ministry types recognized and released? | | |\n| **Organic Systems** — Are your structures simple and reproducible enough to multiply? | | |\n| **Communitas** — Is your community forged in shared mission, not just shared comfort? | | |\n\nRemember: we are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving. If the outcomes are not what the New Testament envisions, the system needs adjustment — not more effort within the existing design.\n\n---\n\n## The Evidence: Where the System Works\n\nThe early church grew from as few as 25,000 in AD 100 to up to 20 million by AD 310 — a persecuted, illegal, marginalized movement that had no buildings, no professional clergy in the modern sense, no political power, and no cultural advantage. All six elements of mDNA were active.\n\nThe Chinese underground church grew from about 2 million to over 120 million in sixty years — stripped of institutions, seminaries, buildings, and professional leadership, under sustained persecution. All six elements of mDNA were active.\n\nEarly American Methodism discipled thirty percent of the population through circuit riders and classes — lay people with rudimentary training, operating in simple, reproducible structures, driven by the lordship of Jesus and a passion for holiness. All six elements were active. When the system was compromised — when discipleship became optional, structures became complex, and mission was replaced by institutional maintenance — the movement declined.\n\nChurch Multiplication Associates, founded by Neil Cole, saw over 10,000 churches planted in sixteen countries in a decade — through Life Transformation Groups, simple structures, and a missional-incarnational commitment. All six elements were active.\n\nThe pattern is unmistakable. When all six elements are present and functioning, movements are born. When any element is absent or suppressed, the system weakens. The question is never whether the system works. It always works. The question is whether we will activate it.\n\n---\n\n## The Personal Integration\n\nThis is not just about communities. It is about you. Apostolic Genius is latent in every true believer. The mDNA is in your spiritual DNA as surely as it is in the DNA of the church.\n\nAsk yourself: Is Jesus functionally Lord of my life — of every area, not just the religious sectors? Am I actively making disciples who make disciples? Am I incarnationally present in my neighborhood and sent into the world? Do I know my APEST calling, and am I functioning in it? Is my life simple enough to be reproducible — could someone follow my pattern? Am I living in the liminal space where communitas is born, or have I retreated to safety?\n\nThe integration is not institutional. It is personal. The movement does not start with a strategy. It starts with a disciple who carries the full DNA.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Question That Haunts\n\nAbout four years prior to writing The Forgotten Ways, I attended a seminar where the speaker asked a question that has haunted me to this day: \"How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?\" It was as if God was calling me to dedicate myself to finding the answer.\n\nThe answer, I believe, is Apostolic Genius — the full mDNA system, activated by the Spirit, functioning in an integrated whole. It was not a strategy. It was not a program. It was a way of being the church that carried within it the potencies for exponential impact.\n\nThose same potencies are in you. In your community. In the ecclesia of which you are a part. The ruby slippers are on your feet.\n\nThe question that remains is whether you will click them together."

What is preventing the activation of what is already there?\n\n4. The Wizard of Oz story suggests we already have what we are looking for — we have simply forgotten how to access it. What has this course helped you remember? What \"ruby slippers\" have you been wearing all along without realizing it?\n\n5. \"Apostolic Genius is a mindset, not a technique.\" Where are you tempted to reduce the mDNA system to a technique — a program to implement rather than a way of being to embody?\n\n6. Review the six elements one final time. For each, complete this sentence: \"The one thing I will do differently because of what I learned about [element] is...\"\n\n7. The course has traced Apostolic Genius through the early church and the Chinese underground church.

This visual represents the dynamic, nonlinear system.\n\nFor each element, rate your community's current state from 1 (absent or nominal) to 5 (deeply embedded and functioning). Mark the rating on each point of the hexagon. Connect the ratings to form a shape.\n\nNow look at the shape. A perfect hexagon means all six are equally active. A lopsided shape reveals where the system is imbalanced. The weakest point is your limiting factor — like the shortest stave of a barrel, it determines the maximum capacity of the whole.\n\n### Part 2: Trace the Connections (Individual or Pairs)\n\nFor each of the 15 connecting lines, write one sentence describing how the two elements interact in your context. Where is the connection strong (both elements reinforcing each other)? Where is it broken (one element undermining or starving the other)?\n\nPay special attention to connections involving your weakest element. Because the system is interconnected, the absence of one element affects every element it connects to. A weakness in discipleship, for example, does not just mean fewer disciples — it means fewer people to send (missional impulse), fewer APEST gifts activated, less capacity for organic multiplication, and less relational depth for communitas.\n\n### Part 3: The Action Plan (Group)\n\nBring your system map to your cohort. Compare maps. Identify common patterns — where are your communities collectively strong? Where are they collectively weak?\n\nThen together, design a ninety-day action plan that addresses the most critical weakness. Not six initiatives for six elements. One focused intervention aimed at the element that, if strengthened, would most improve the whole system.\n\n**Output:** Your visual system map, your connection analysis, and your ninety-day action plan.

From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.\"\n\n**Reflection:** The destination of the entire mDNA system is not organizational effectiveness. It is the fullness of Christ — the church becoming what it was designed to be. Every element points toward this. Every connection serves this. The system exists for one purpose: to bring the body to maturity in Christ.\n\nAs you prepare for the final week — commissioning and sending — carry this with you: you are not implementing a program. You are activating a latent potential. The ruby slippers are on your feet. The question is not whether you have what you need. The question is whether you will use it.\n\n**Closing Prayer:** Pray for the full activation of Apostolic Genius in each community represented in this room. Pray for the ninety-day plans. Pray for the courage to address the weakest element and the faith to trust the system. And pray that the fullness of Christ becomes not just a theological concept but a lived reality in your midst.

You now carry knowledge of the six elements of mDNA — Jesus Is Lord, Disciple-Making, the Missional-Incarnational Impulse, APEST Culture, Organic Systems, and Communitas — and the emergent phenomenon of Apostolic Genius that occurs when all six are active.\n\nBut let me say what I always say at this point: knowledge is not the goal. Formation is. The question is not whether you understand the system. The question is whether the system is activating in you — in your life, in your community, in the way you inhabit the world.\n\n**[THE HONEST RECKONING]**\n\nSome of you are leaving this course energized and ready to act. Good. Do not waste that energy. Channel it into the ninety-day plan you designed last week. Start with the weakest element. Build from there.\n\nSome of you are leaving overwhelmed — the gap between what you have seen and what you are currently living feels enormous. That is normal. That is the dissonance doing its work. Do not try to change everything at once. Pick one thing. The most important thing. And start there.\n\nSome of you are leaving skeptical — wondering whether this actually works in your context, with your resources, in your culture. To you I say: the evidence is overwhelming. The early church did it with no resources. The Chinese church did it under persecution. The Methodists did it with lay people on horseback. CMA did it with groups of two and three reading Scripture together. The system works. The question is not whether it works. The question is whether we will trust it.\n\n**[THE COMMISSION]**\n\nYou are not leaving this course as consumers of information. You are leaving as bearers of the DNA. The mDNA is in you. It has always been in you. What this course has done — I hope — is help you remember what was forgotten.\n\nGo and make disciples. Go into the neighborhoods. Release the fivefold. Simplify the structures. Follow Jesus into the liminal spaces. And do it together — as comrades, not just acquaintances. As a movement, not just a church.\n\nThe ruby slippers are on your feet. Click them together. Go home. And change the world.\n\n**[CLOSE]**\n\nIt has been my privilege to walk this journey with you. I believe in you — not because you are extraordinary, but because the God who designed the church is extraordinary. And the church he designed already has everything it needs.\n\nGo in peace. Go in power. Go in the name of the one who holds all authority in heaven and on earth."

What will you do, by when, with whom?\n\n## Part 3: The Commissioning Statement\n\nWrite a personal commissioning statement — three to five sentences that capture your commitment going forward. This is not a mission statement for your organization. It is a personal declaration of how you will live the mDNA in the next season of your life.\n\nThis statement should be:\n- **Specific** — naming concrete practices and contexts, not abstract intentions\n- **Christocentric** — rooted in the lordship of Jesus, not in self-improvement\n- **Reproducible** — something you can pass on to others, not just practice alone\n- **Liminal** — oriented toward risk and mission, not toward comfort and safety\n\nRead it aloud to your cohort in the final session. Let it be your commission — from Jesus, through this community, into the world.\n\n## Instructions\n\nComplete this assessment before your final cohort session. Bring all three parts. Part 3 will be shared aloud as part of the commissioning liturgy."

For eight weeks we have explored the DNA that Jesus planted in his church: the lordship that organizes all reality, the disciple-making that forms his people, the sending that takes them into the world, the fivefold gifts that equip them, the organic structures that multiply them, and the forged-in-fire community that sustains them.\n\nNow we commission you. Not as experts. Not as program leaders. As bearers of the DNA — ordinary people who carry within them the same potencies that energized the early church and the Chinese underground church. The ruby slippers are on your feet.\n\n---\n\n### The Confession (Together)\n\n*We confess that Jesus is Lord — not of the religious sector alone, but of all reality.*\n*We confess that we are called to be disciples who make disciples — not admirers, but followers.*\n*We confess that we are sent — into neighborhoods, cultures, and the margins of society.*\n*We confess that we carry gifts — apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching — given by the ascended Christ for the fullness of his body.*\n*We confess that the kingdom grows organically — through seeds, not monuments.*\n*We confess that we are tent dwellers — pilgrims formed by the journey, not settlers defined by the building.*\n\n---\n\n### The Commissioning Statements (Individual)\n\nEach person reads aloud the commissioning statement they wrote for the final assessment. After each statement, the group responds:\n\n**Group Response:** *Go in the name of Jesus. We send you. We hold you accountable. We pray for you.*\n\n---\n\n### The Charge (Facilitator)\n\nYou have been given the forgotten ways. Do not forget them again.\n\nMake disciples. Go to where people are. Release every gift. Keep it simple. Follow Jesus into the unknown — together.\n\nThe question is not whether you believe in Apostolic Genius. The question is whether you will activate it. Not next year. Not when conditions are right. Now. With what you have. Where you are.\n\n---\n\n### The Blessing (Facilitator)\n\nMay the Lord who holds all authority in heaven and on earth send you with the confidence of the sent.\n\nMay the one who changed the world through patient, relentless discipleship give you the perseverance to form followers who form followers.\n\nMay the God who moved into the neighborhood give you the courage to move with him — into the places that need his presence most.\n\nMay the Christ who is apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher activate the fullness of his ministry through you.\n\nMay the one who designed seeds to grow while farmers sleep give you the faith to plant and the patience to wait.\n\nAnd may the Spirit who hovers over chaos and brings life from the edge give you the companionship of comrades — not just acquaintances, but fellow travelers, ruined for the ordinary, bound together in the most important mission in the world.\n\nGo. The DNA is in you. It has always been in you.\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n---\n\n### Closing (Facilitator)\n\nThe course is complete. The journey has begun. Stay connected. Hold each other accountable. And remember: no disciples, no movement. Some disciples, some movement. Many disciples — deeply formed, actively multiplying followers of Jesus — create the basis on which movements generate and develop.\n\nThat is where movement lives. Now go and live it."

Where did you experience communitas — the forged-in-fire bonding — within this group? Where did you experience it outside the group because of what you learned here?\n\n**Question 3:** Share your ninety-day action plan. What are you committed to? Who will hold you accountable?\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Commission (30 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** This is the heart of the final session. Follow the Commissioning Liturgy (W8.3) — The Confession (together), The Commissioning Statements (individual), and The Charge.\n\nEach person reads their personal commissioning statement aloud. The group responds after each one: *Go in the name of Jesus. We send you. We hold you accountable. We pray for you.*\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Send (15 minutes)\n\n**Facilitator Note:** Close with The Blessing from the Commissioning Liturgy and a time of prayer for one another.\n\n**Prayer:** Pray for each person by name.

This is your primary commitment for the next three months. Review it weekly. Report to your accountability partner or cohort monthly. Adjust as needed — but do not abandon it. The temptation after a course like this is to return to the way things were. Resist that temptation. The mDNA is in you. Activation requires sustained practice, not momentary enthusiasm.\n\n### The Cohort Connection\n\nStay connected with your cohort beyond the course. Agree on a simple rhythm:\n- **Monthly check-in:** A thirty-minute call or meeting to report on your ninety-day plan. What happened? What is working? Where are you stuck?\n- **Quarterly gathering:** A longer session (ninety minutes) to revisit the full mDNA system, share stories, and recalibrate.\n\nThe bonds formed in this course are the beginning of communitas. Do not let them dissolve into acquaintance. Sustain them with shared mission and mutual accountability.\n\n### The Formation Companion\n\nYour AI formation companion remains available beyond the course. Use it for:\n- Processing specific challenges as you implement your ninety-day plan\n- Deepening your understanding of any mDNA element\n- Preparing to teach or facilitate mDNA content with your own community\n- Working through the recommended reading with guided reflection\n\n### Passing It On\n\nA disciple who does not make disciples is an incomplete disciple. The same is true of this content. Consider:\n- **Teaching the mDNA framework** to your community — not as a program, but as a shared language for understanding what the church is designed to be.\n- **Starting a reading group** around The Forgotten Ways with your leadership team.\n- **Recommending this course** to others who are ready for the journey.\n- **Living the content** — which is, ultimately, the most powerful form of transmission. When people see Apostolic Genius activated in a real community, they do not need convincing. They want to join.\n\n### The Final Word\n\nThe question that haunted the beginning of this course remains the question that defines its ending: How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?\n\nThe answer is Apostolic Genius. The answer is mDNA. The answer is the latent potential that lies dormant in every community that confesses Jesus as Lord.\n\nYour job is to activate it. Not next year. Now.\n\nGo."

        "The Western church has largely operated within a Christendom framework for over 1,700 years, and much of what we assume to be normative Christianity is actually the result of cultural accommodation rather than biblical faithfulness. In Reframation, Alan Hirsch argues that the church needs a fundamental reframing of its self-understanding, theology, and practice in order to recover its missional calling.",
        "Drawing on decades of research into apostolic movements, Hirsch lays out a compelling case for why the inherited model of church -- centered on buildings, clergy, and programs -- fails to produce the kind of disciple-making movements that characterized the early church. He invites readers to reconsider the assumptions that shape how we gather, lead, and engage the world around us.",
        "This is not a book about minor adjustments. It is a call to re-examine the very frames through which we see the church, leadership, and mission. With theological rigor and practical insight, Hirsch provides a roadmap for communities ready to move beyond institutional maintenance toward genuine missional engagement."
