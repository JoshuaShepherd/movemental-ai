            <p class="e-article-body__lead">Every leader faces a defining moment. It is the moment when you realize that the very things that made you successful are now holding you back. For most of us, that moment comes when we recognize we have been playing the hero in our own story — and it is time to become something greater.</p>

            <h2 id="the-hero-trap">The Hero Trap</h2>
            <p>Leaders are wired to solve problems, cast vision, and drive results. And for a season, that works brilliantly. You step in. You deliver. People celebrate you. The organization grows. But then something shifts. The growth plateaus. The team waits for you to make every decision. The best emerging leaders leave because there is no room for them. And you are exhausted.</p>
            <p>This is what I call the Hero Trap. It is the gravitational pull that draws every leader toward being the center of their organization. And here is the uncomfortable truth: the Hero Trap is not something that happens to you. It is something you create — often with the best of intentions.</p>

            <h2 id="what-is-a-hero-maker">What Is a Hero Maker?</h2>
            <p>A hero maker is a leader who makes it their primary mission to develop other leaders. Not just to delegate tasks or fill volunteer slots, but to genuinely invest in people, give them real authority, and celebrate when they succeed — especially when they succeed without you.</p>
            <p>Jesus was the ultimate hero maker. He spent three years investing in twelve ordinary people, and within a generation, they had started a movement that reached the known world. He did not build an organization around himself. He built leaders who built leaders who built leaders.</p>

            <h3 id="five-practices">The Five Essential Practices</h3>
            <p>In studying Jesus' approach and observing multiplying leaders around the world, I have identified five essential practices that every hero maker must master:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Multiplication Thinking:</strong> Shifting from "How many can I lead?" to "How many leaders can I develop who develop leaders?"</li>
              <li><strong>Permission Giving:</strong> Creating a culture where people don't have to ask permission to act — they know they already have it.</li>
              <li><strong>Disciple Multiplying:</strong> Using the apprenticeship model of "I do, you watch / You do, I watch" to develop people at every level.</li>
              <li><strong>Gift Activating:</strong> Learning to see gifts in people before they see them in themselves, and commissioning them to use those gifts.</li>
              <li><strong>Kingdom Building:</strong> Expanding your vision beyond your own organization to collaborate for kingdom-level impact.</li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>
              <p>"The hero gets a statue. The hero maker starts a movement. And movements change the world in ways that statues never can."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2 id="from-addition-to-multiplication">From Addition to Multiplication</h2>
            <p>Most organizations operate in addition mode. They add one more service, one more program, one more campus, one more staff member. Addition works, but it has a ceiling — the ceiling of the leader's capacity. Multiplication is fundamentally different. It is not about doing more yourself. It is about developing people who develop people who develop people.</p>
            <p>Here is the math that changed my life: if you add one leader per year, after ten years you have ten leaders. But if you multiply — developing one leader who develops one leader — after ten years you have over a thousand. That is the power of multiplication thinking.</p>

            <h2 id="permission-giving-culture">Creating a Permission-Giving Culture</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest barriers to multiplication is a culture that requires permission for everything. In most organizations, the default answer is "no" until someone with authority says "yes." Hero makers flip this. They create cultures where the default answer is "yes."</p>
            <p>At Community Christian Church, we developed what we call the "Green Light / Red Light" principle. Everything is a green light — go ahead and try it — unless it contradicts our core beliefs or could cause irreparable harm. That is a dramatically shorter list than most leaders think.</p>

            <h3 id="practical-steps">Practical Steps to Start Today</h3>
            <p>You do not need to wait until you have read every book or taken every course. You can start the shift from hero to hero maker today with three simple actions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify one person in your organization who has leadership potential that is going undeveloped. Take them to coffee this week and ask about their dreams.</li>
              <li>Find one task you are currently doing that someone else could do — and actually hand it over with real authority, not just the grunt work.</li>
              <li>Change the way you measure success. Stop counting what you are doing and start counting what others are doing because of your investment in them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="the-hardest-part">The Hardest Part</h2>
            <p>I will be honest with you: the hardest part of becoming a hero maker is not learning new skills. It is letting go of your identity as the hero. When someone else preaches and the church loves it, will you celebrate or feel threatened? When a leader you developed launches something bigger than anything you built, will you cheer or compete?</p>
            <p>The hero maker journey is ultimately a journey of the heart. It requires a deep security in who God made you to be — not what you do, not what you build, not what people say about you. It requires believing that your greatest legacy will not be what you accomplished, but who you developed.</p>

            <h2 id="start-a-movement">Start a Movement</h2>
            <p>I have seen this play out around the world. In Lagos, a church planter named James took the hero maker principles and developed twelve leaders in his first year. Those twelve developed twelve more. Within five years, they had planted forty-seven churches across West Africa. James did not plant forty-seven churches. He made hero makers who made hero makers.</p>
            <p>That is the invitation before you. Not to do more, but to be more — more generous with your authority, more intentional about developing others, more willing to decrease so that others can increase.</p>
            <p>The world does not need more heroes. It needs more hero makers.</p>
