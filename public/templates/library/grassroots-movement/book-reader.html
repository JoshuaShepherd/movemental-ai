      <h2 class="book-reader__chapter-heading">The Crisis of Imagination</h2>

      <div class="book-reader__prose">
        <p>We are living through one of the most significant periods of cultural upheaval in the history of Western civilization. The institutions that once gave shape and meaning to our lives -- churches, civic organizations, educational systems -- are undergoing profound transformation. Some are thriving; many are struggling to find their footing in unfamiliar terrain.</p>

        <p>The church is no exception. Across the Western world, congregations that once seemed unshakable are facing existential questions about their purpose, their methods, and their very identity. Attendance declines, cultural irrelevance, and an aging constituency have become the norm rather than the exception. For many leaders, the future feels uncertain at best.</p>

        <blockquote>The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence itself but to act with yesterday's logic.</blockquote>

        <p>But here is the provocative truth at the heart of this book: the crisis we face is not primarily one of strategy, resources, or even theology. It is a crisis of imagination. We have lost the capacity to envision the church as anything other than what we have inherited -- a building, a Sunday service, a program-driven institution managed by religious professionals.</p>

        <p>This failure of imagination is not merely an intellectual problem. It reaches into the very fabric of our ecclesiology, our missiology, and our understanding of discipleship. When we cannot imagine alternatives, we default to maintaining what already exists, even when what exists is manifestly failing to accomplish the mission of God.</p>

        <p>The early church, by contrast, was a movement of extraordinary imaginative power. Without buildings, budgets, or bureaucracies, a small band of Jesus-followers managed to turn the entire Roman Empire upside down within a few generations. They did so not because they had better strategies but because they carried within them a fundamentally different imagination -- a vision of reality shaped by the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

        <p>What if we could recover that imagination? What if the resources we need for the future of the church are not to be found in the latest leadership techniques or church-growth methods but in the ancient patterns of apostolic movement that have been hidden in plain sight all along?</p>

        <p>That is the premise of Reframation. This book is an invitation to reframe -- to look at everything we think we know about church, mission, and discipleship through a different lens. Not a new lens, exactly, but a very old one that has been polished and made clear for our current moment.</p>

        <p>In the chapters that follow, we will explore the core elements of what I call Apostolic Genius -- the built-in life force of the church that, when activated, produces extraordinary missional movement. We will examine why this genius has been suppressed in the Western church and, more importantly, how it can be recovered.</p>

        <p>But first, we must honestly face the depth of the crisis. We must resist the temptation to offer easy answers or quick fixes. The transformation we need goes far deeper than rearranging programs or adopting new technologies. It requires nothing less than a fundamental reframing of how we understand the church itself.</p>
