# Course hero / cover art

Course hero images used on course detail, course player poster, and course overview.

## Expected files

Place course cover art here and reference from leader JSON `course.heroImage`:

| File | Used by |
|------|--------|
| **course-mdna-primer-cover-desktop.webp** | Alan Hirsch — mDNA course (hero on course detail, player poster, overview card) |

## Path from templates

From HTML in `directories/pastoral-warm/` or data in `directories/data/`:

- `../images/art/courses/course-mdna-primer-cover-desktop.webp`

## Fallback

If a course has no `heroImage`, templates use the leader’s portrait (`portrait.headshot`) for the hero and overview card.
