<h1>Chapter 2: The Universality and Origins of APEST: Archetypes, Myths, and Hero-Expression</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Scenius is like genius, only embedded in a scene rather than in a gene.”
—Brian Eno</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we go down into ourselves, we find that we possess exactly what we desire.”
—Simone Weil</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Divine grace … is secretly at work in the whole sphere of history, and thus all myths, philosophies, and poetic creations are innately capable of housing within themselves an intimation of divine glory.”
—Hans Urs von Balthasar</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The forms of archetypes, myths, and hero-expression were evident in society long before the earthly ministry of Jesus and remain present in contemporary society beyond the church. I believe this is highly significant to the mission and effectiveness of God’s people everywhere. <strong>APEST</strong> is not exclusive to churches or Christian organizations.</p>
<p>The fivefold functions, intelligences, or capacities are not limited to the faith community nor do they emerge solely upon conversion.</p>
<p>Rather, there is a noticeable correlation between APEST as it is expressed in the church and other generic functions in broader human culture and history—a concept we might call “non-church APEST.”</p>
<p>The idea that God shapes our lives before conversion is consistent with biblical understandings of calling; both Paul and Jeremiah state that they were called to their respective roles before birth (Galatians 1:15–16; Jeremiah 1:5).</p>
<p>Reflecting on my own life, I discern clear roots of my calling long before I recognized its significance within faith.</p>
<p>No doubt, you can do the same.</p>
<p>While APEST brings enhanced, distinct meanings in the Jesus movement, there is more continuity than difference.</p>
<p>The fivefold typology is, in some sense, a category universal to humankind.</p>
<p>Therefore, APEST is much larger—and far more important—than previously imagined.</p>

<h2>The Gifts of God</h2>
<p>Any attempt to restrict God’s gifts to “spiritual” gifts (imparted after conversion) disregards the breadth of Scripture’s perspective on God’s gifts to creation and his people.</p>
<p>Human culture and achievement reflect the astonishing variety and diversity of God’s design, intention, and ongoing work in everyone.</p>
<p>God bestows creation-gifts in every conceivable form and manner.</p>
<p>Beyond natural gifts, humans are endowed with an amazing array of physical, artistic, and intellectual abilities, intelligences, and possibilities.</p>
<p>God's original and ongoing intention is for every person, with their unique gifts and abilities, to serve as instruments of blessing for others.</p>
<p>Each person has a gift, task, place, and role—a channel of creative goodness (Matthew 7:11; James 1:17).</p>
<p>The fundamental logic behind all creational gifts is rooted in God’s blessing: gifts are meant to be received, appropriated, and shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans as image-bearers are commissioned to exercise godly stewardship over creation—a concept theologians call “the cultural mandate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humans are to carry out God’s will for creation and embody his concern for the flourishing of all life, acting as co-laborers with God.</p>
<p>This <strong>creation gifting and mandate</strong> applies universally—to Christian and non-Christian alike.</p>
<h3>The "Masks of God" and Archetype in Culture</h3>
<p>God’s goodness can be experienced “incognito” across creation.</p>
<p>Martin Luther termed this the “masks of God,” or what the Latin Fathers call <em>vestigia Dei</em> (the traces of God)—signs of God’s existence and being, embedded in creation.</p>
<p>These “traces” are evidence of the Creator, who reveals himself as the source and goal of all paths.</p>
<p>God paradoxically both conceals and reveals himself “in, with, and under” Creation.</p>
<p>These traces are visible in human acts of goodness, as well as in art, science, education, family, politics, law, marriage, recreation, and more.</p>
<p>Since everything derives from God, all creaturely being can be seen as an indicative utterance about God.</p>

<h2>Archetypes, Heroes, and the Orders of Creation</h2>
<h3>What Are Archetypes?</h3>
<p><strong>Archetypes</strong> are mysterious, recurrent symbols, values, or motifs deeply latent in all story, art, thought, and action.</p>
<p>The word derives from the Greek <em>arche</em>—“beginning,” “origin,” or “source of action” (cf.</p>
<p>John 1:1–3).</p>
<p>An <em>arche</em> is a formative aspect at the roots of something; archetypes are primordial ideas that shape our world experience.</p>
<p>People across cultures and eras dream of common themes—God, life, death, good and evil, love.</p>
<p>These experiences often transcend language.</p>
<p>Thus, archetypes exist in individual (conscious and subconscious) experiences and are recreated in arts and literature.</p>
<h4>Influence Across Disciplines</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Archetypes, or “first principles,” are considered the basis of knowledge itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of Plato’s “forms” and “universals.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biology:</strong> Instincts or “fixed action patterns” are archetypal behaviors preprogrammed into animal (and human) species.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology &#x26; Sociology:</strong> Archetypes operate from within the collective unconscious, the social imaginary, or the <em>habitus</em> of culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because archetypes are deeply woven into the human soul and culture, they feel familiar—more remembered than learned—and motivate action, acting as what many call “the Culture Code.”</p>
<h4>Historical and Cultural Patterns</h4>
<p>Patterns such as royalty, democracies, marriage, city-building, law—recurring across history—are archetypal forces or “memes.” In literature and art, archetypes wield strong mythical influence.</p>
<p>Superheroes and arch-villains in comics often trace their lineage to Greek myth, sacred texts, and universal hero narratives—including the Bible.</p>
<p>There are archetypal cities, such as Sodom, Babylon, and Rome, that serve as metaphors for decadence; or Jerusalem/Zion as the ideal community.</p>
<p>Organizational archetypes—Explorer, Caregiver, Genius—also pervade branding and societal roles.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Bible and Archetypes</h2>
<p>Biblical literature not only employs existing archetypes, but provides language to recognize and categorize them, notably through teachings on <em>powers and principalities</em>.</p>
<h3>Biblical Terms for Foundational Forces</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Arche</em> – Foundational forces</li>
<li><em>Exousia</em> – Authorities/powers</li>
<li><em>Stoicheia</em> – Elemental spirits/principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul discusses these spiritual and cultural forces in Colossians 1:16–17.</p>
<p>Like instinctive archetypes, they continue to influence, direct, and even coerce human behavior.</p>
<p>These forces manifest across religion, society, and culture, both angelic and demonic, in institutions, ideologies, and social systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—Colossians 1:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While many powers are fallen, the Bible asserts their legitimacy comes from creation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through Christ, they are reconciled and realigned with the Kingdom (Colossians 1:19–20, 2:15–23).</p>
<h3>Archetypes Fulfilled in Christ</h3>
<p>Hans Urs von Balthasar observes that all spiritual archetypes converge in Christ and are fulfilled in the Body of Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Archetypes] do not hover over the Body as unattainable ideas, but, rather, each in its own way ... these archetypal experiences are the very foundation of the life-form of believing man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The Hero: Living Expression of the Archetype</h2>
<p>Heroes—individuals or organizations—serve as role models and ideal expressions of archetypes embedded in a culture’s myths and aspirations.</p>
<p>They reflect collective identity and become standards of action.</p>
<p>Societies require heroes to pass on cultural “genes” and embody communal vision.</p>
<p>Saints, for example (Hebrews 11), are spiritual heroes making faith more attainable for others.</p>
<p>The mythology apparent in most films emerges through archetypal imagery brought to life by the hero.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>Divergent</em> series uses five factions—mirroring APEST—highlighting the need for unity among diverse strengths.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Scenius: The Roots and Shoots of Fivefold Culture</h2>
<p>Brian Eno coined "scenius" to describe collective, not individual, creativity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Scenius stands for the intelligence and intuition of a whole cultural scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the communal form of the concept of the genius … Scenius is like genius, only embedded in a scene rather than in a gene.”</p>
<p><em>APEST</em> archetypes are seeds within the heart of all culture—what I call the “scenius” of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Once you recognize APEST categories, you can identify their expressions across archetypes, capacities, heroes, and organizations, both within and outside the church.</p>
<p>The language Paul uses in Ephesians 4:11 (“apostle,” “prophet,” “evangelist,” “shepherd,” “teacher”) is drawn from broader Greco-Roman culture, indicating that these roles are not unique to Christianity, but are given special theological significance.</p>
<hr>
<h2>APEST as Aptitudes or Forms of Intelligence</h2>
<p>APEST, viewed as five key archetypes latent in all creation, provides a robust framework for understanding and organizing human thought and endeavor.</p>
<p>While more than five archetypes exist, the fivefold typology is particularly potent.</p>
<h3>Correspondence with Contemporary Typologies</h3>
<p>Many personality instruments (e.g., Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder, Enneagram) hinge on archetype-like categories. MBTI, for example, is grounded in temperament archetypes echoing APEST.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Five Voices (GiANT Worldwide):</strong> Pioneer, Creative, Connector, Nurturer, Guardian</li>
<li><strong>Erica Ariel Fox:</strong> Dreamer, Thinker, Lover, Warrior, Lookout, Voyager</li>
<li><strong>Tapestry (Christian women's magazine):</strong> Visionary, Messenger, Storyteller, Nurturer, Teacher</li>
</ul>
<p>Such models demonstrate deep resonance because they appeal to universal archetypes already present in society and individual psychology.</p>
<hr>
<h2>From IQ to EQ to 5Q</h2>
<p>Each APEST archetype or hero processes and engages the world in unique ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IQ:</strong> Reasoning abilities</li>
<li><strong>EQ:</strong> Emotional intelligence</li>
<li><strong>CQ:</strong> Cultural intelligence</li>
<li><strong>PQ:</strong> Political intelligence</li>
<li><strong>5Q (APEST):</strong> Fivefold intelligence—combining distinct types for heightened social and organizational capability</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, teaching—brings a unique perspective, fostering synergistic intelligence in human society and the church.</p>
<h3>Domains of Society</h3>
<p>Recognizing APEST archetypes helps us discern and develop capacities across all major domains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts, recreation, entertainment</li>
<li>Architecture, construction</li>
<li>Politics, media, industry</li>
<li>Economy, education, family</li>
<li>Government, health, science, religion</li>
</ul>
<p>Universities could, for example, structure curricula along the fivefold lines to better harness these archetypes.</p>

<h2>Implications for Leadership Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>APEST is a valuable tool beyond the church, especially for general leadership theory and practice.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 describes fivefold leadership as equipping, building up, and bringing the Body to maturity and unity.</p>
<h3>Leadership Roles as APEST Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apostolic:</strong> Vision-caster, strategist, founder</li>
<li><strong>Prophetic:</strong> Foresight, analysis, challenge, quality controller</li>
<li><strong>Evangelistic:</strong> Recruiter, marketer, communicator</li>
<li><strong>Shepherding:</strong> HR, coach, caregiver, mediator</li>
<li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Trainer, manager, explainer</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations benefit by leveraging these types to form balanced teams, maximize impact, develop members, and manage creative conflict.</p>
<p>Business leaders such as Walt Pilcher apply fivefold typologies to build and assess organizations.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Metaphysics of APEST</h2>
<h3>5Q Latent in the Image of God (Imago Dei)</h3>
<p>Genesis reveals that humans, as image-bearers of God, reflect the divine nature and character.</p>
<p>Looking through a 5Q lens, we see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationality:</strong> Prophetic and pastoral concerns—desire for right relationship and intimacy</li>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Apostolic and evangelistic—command to rule and serve</li>
<li><strong>Rationality:</strong> Teaching and apostolic—capacity for logic, systems, and wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Expressed across all five, especially apostolic and evangelistic instincts</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Prophetic and teaching—discernment, choice, and obedience</li>
<li><strong>Language:</strong> Especially expressed in apostolic, teaching, and shepherding functions</li>
</ul>
<p>All humans posses these dimensions, though expressed in varying degrees.</p>
<h3>5Q Through Christ</h3>
<p>Jesus, as the true image of God (Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:1–3), redeems and embodies the fivefold functions.</p>
<p>Through his incarnation, death, and resurrection, he validates and blesses APEST, giving them theological depth and Christological grounding.</p>
<h3>5Q as Common Grace</h3>
<p>Christians have long believed that all creation, though fallen, bears God’s fingerprints (<em>vestigia Dei</em>).</p>
<p>All creation continues to testify to God’s glory and purposes (Psalm 19; Romans 8).</p>
<p>C.S.</p>
<p>Lewis notes that God is always at work in the ordinary and extraordinary—the processes seen in Christ’s miracles are ongoing acts of God in the world.</p>
<p>Thus, APEST can be viewed as a hermeneutical key, tracing its origin from the functions given to the church, through creation and the imago Dei, and ultimately rooted in the being of God.</p>
<hr>
