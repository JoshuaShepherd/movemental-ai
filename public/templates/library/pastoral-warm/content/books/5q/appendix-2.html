<h2>Appendix 2: A Game of Thrones?</h2>
<p>Charismatic or Missional Approaches?</p>
<p>A separate but related issue to cessationism is the tendency to interpret the fivefold ministry through a hierarchical leadership paradigm, especially in the context of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) and within Pentecostal-Charismatic (P-C) traditions.</p>
<p>Many in these circles frame the fivefold primarily in terms of authority (<em>exousia</em>) and power (<em>dynamis</em>)—both for individual believers and the corporate church.</p>
<p>While the pursuit of Holy Spirit empowerment is valid, applying this paradigm to the Ephesians 4:11 vocations constitutes a categorical error.</p>
<p>Within the P-C stream, conferring the titles of apostle or prophet is often associated with an aura of spiritual power and priestly authority.</p>
<p>This can give rise to a cult of religious celebrity, fostering environments where leaders become untouchable and may dominate or exploit followers.</p>
<p>This is not unique to charismatics; similar dynamics appear elsewhere in evangelical circles.</p>
<p>The gifts of the Spirit listed in 1 Corinthians 12–14 are for the empowerment of all Christians, but Ephesians 4:11 describes gifts from Jesus to the entire Body. APEST is the heritage of the church as a whole, not just for leaders, and is prescriptive for all.</p>
<h3>Ministry for All, Not Leadership for a Few</h3>
<p>Where dysfunction emerges is in churches that identify leaders as “God’s anointed”—untouchable individuals operating within hierarchical office structures, manifesting authoritarian power.</p>
<p>This misappropriation of APEST typologies as a warrant for hierarchical authority subverts the intended cruciform, incarnational model of Jesus’ leadership (see Luke 22:24–26; Philippians 2:1–11).</p>
<p>Instead, APEST must be continually shaped by the humility and self-emptying of Christ.</p>
<p>Any co-option of these gifts to worldly concepts of power undermines the polycentric, radically non-hierarchical dynamic of the New Testament church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 makes clear that ministry is given to the <em>entire</em> Body (v. 7), not just to a subset of leaders.</p>
<p>Notably, leadership is not even explicitly mentioned in the text; approaching Ephesians 4 as a leadership passage risks institutional dysfunction and division.</p>
<h3>Activating the Fivefold without Division</h3>
<p>The way forward is to recognize APEST as the means by which the ministry of Christ is expressed through the whole Body, leading to its fullness and missional vitality.</p>
<p>Paul addresses the entire ecclesia—men and women, slaves and free, every race—emphasizing that each member is apportioned a gift from Christ for the common good (Ephesians 4:7).</p>
<p>Leadership should emerge from <em>within</em> these distributed gifts, not be imposed above them.</p>
<p>Approaching the fivefold with this Christological understanding frees us from the destructive power dynamics that have plagued much of church history.</p>
