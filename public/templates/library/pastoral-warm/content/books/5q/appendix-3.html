<h2>Appendix 3: The Exiling of the APEs</h2>
<p><em>By Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim, 2012</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The basic trouble [with the modern church] is that the proposed cure has such a striking similarity to the disease."
—Elton Trueblood</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In a revolutionary era ... you need to learn to think and act like a revolutionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People in revolutions who don’t act that way have a particular name: victims."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—Joshua Ramo Cooper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recurring theme of the “exiled hero” in literature and film points to an embedded wisdom: sometimes the solutions needed by the community come from the margins and from those who have been rejected.</p>
<p>Likewise, the ministries of Apostle, Prophet, and Evangelist (APEs) have been cast out of mainstream church life.</p>
<p>The prevailing Shepherd-Teacher (ST) model of leadership, though essential for stability, has, in isolation, led to equilibrium and stasis—a condition akin to organizational death.</p>
<h3>The Dangers of Equilibrium</h3>
<p>When the ST roles dominate at the expense of APEST as a whole, the church loses its capacity for adaptive change, missional engagement, and creative renewal.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Goldstein describes organizational equilibrium as the state of least complexity—a place where any change is resisted and innovation is stifled.</p>
<p>Over time, the resources necessary for renewal (often embodied by APEs) are ejected, leaving the organization incapable of change even when it is most needed.</p>
<p>However, these issues are not necessarily the result of bad intentions; rather, the ST gifts serve to build community and sustain faith.</p>
<p>But as integrators and operators, Shepherds and Teachers are not equipped to drive missional movement alone.</p>
<p>Generative, adaptive ministry comes through the interplay with APEs.</p>
<h3>Restoring the Necessary Dialectic</h3>
<p>Living systems resist change and tend toward equilibrium, but continual adaptation is vital.</p>
<p>Thus, leadership must be willing to endure necessary conflict and disruption in order to move God’s people forward.</p>
<p>The vested interests, pride, and failure to recognize systemic issues can hinder change—but the Spirit’s calling toward mission must be awakened.</p>
<p>All humans are vulnerable to the misuse of power.</p>
<p>Both APE and ST roles carry risks, but it has largely been the monopolizing of leadership by priestly (ST) types that has led to profound abuses and a loss of generative capacity within the church.</p>
<p>This has robbed the church of its adventurous, missional character, leaving it defensive and risk-averse.</p>
<p>Christ’s Kingdom calls leaders to guide the church into the future, embracing risk and overcoming the impulse for safety.</p>
<p>The Great Commission is not a guarantee of “safe” ministry, but rather a call to faithfulness amid challenge.</p>
<h3>Re-embracing the Exiled Ministries</h3>
<p>Renewal requires a return to the foundational sources and a willingness to integrate all five APEST ministries—Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd, Teacher—for the sake of the church's mission and maturity.</p>
