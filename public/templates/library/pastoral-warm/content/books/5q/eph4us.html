<h1>Chapter 7: Eph4Us—The Fivefold Functionality of the Church</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“The church proclaims the Gospel in order to awaken faith in Jesus Christ, provoke commitment in the Spirit, make Christ present in society, and carry on the cause of Christ.”
—Hans Küng</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.”
—G.K. Chesterton</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Do or do not. There is no try!”

<p>In this chapter, the focus shifts from a strictly biblical-theological exploration to a discussion of how to embed 5Q into the life and practice of your local church or organization.</p>
<p>This is where the fivefold meets organizational reality.</p>
<p>Despite being marginalized in much of the Western church tradition, the functions and vocations of APEST have been ever-present throughout church renewals, movements, revivals, and the lives of heroes in history.</p>
<p>Viewing through a 5Q lens reveals that most renewal movements have involved the recovery of one or more of the five functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Catholic Orders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Franciscans: Prophetic and Shepherding</li>
<li>Jesuits: Apostolic</li>
<li>Benedictines: Teaching</li>
<li>Carmelites: Mystical-Prophetic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protestant Movements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sending and mission agencies: Recoveries of lost APE functions</li>
<li>Para-church organizations:
<ul>
<li>Campus Crusade (Cru): Apostolic-Evangelistic</li>
<li>Navigators: Evangelistic-Disciple-making</li>
<li>Intervarsity: Evangelistic-Teaching</li>
<li>World Vision: Prophetic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical Exemplars of APEST Callings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>St. Patrick: Apostle/Shepherd</li>
<li>Francis of Assisi: Prophet/Apostle</li>
<li>Teresa of Ávila: Prophet/Teacher</li>
<li>Martin Luther: Prophet/Teacher</li>
<li>John Calvin: Teacher</li>
<li>John Wesley: Apostle/Prophet</li>
<li>Catherine Booth: Apostle</li>
<li>Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Prophet/Teacher</li>
<li>George Whitefield: Evangelist</li>
<li>Billy Graham: Evangelist</li>
<li>Mother Teresa: Shepherd</li>
<li>Martin Luther King Jr.: Prophet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Their contributions transcend traditional pastoral and academic profiles.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ would not be faithful—perhaps could not even survive—without these historical expressions of APEST.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Five-Dimensional Church: Functions and Callings</h2>
<p>Much of our sense of destiny and purpose lies in discovering our unique calling.</p>
<p>Each disciple is obligated to strive to understand and live into their calling as Christ has apportioned it (Ephesians 4:1, 7).</p>
<p>The APEST framework is the best way of grasping that calling.</p>
<p>Each person can and should develop a unique APEST portrait—a picture of one's identity and destiny in and by Jesus.</p>
<p>However, 5Q is much larger than individual profile.</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grounded in the being of God</strong></li>
<li><strong>Woven through creation in archetype, myth, and hero</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recapitulated in Christ</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bequeathed to the church</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expressed through the saints for God’s glory and the church’s edification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals are particular expressions of a grand universal unfolding of God’s purposes. APEST is far more than just finding one’s “ministry mojo.” Jesus is the exemplary expression of APEST, the Head of the Body, and the Giver of these gifts.</p>
<p>Jesus embeds these fivefold identities (personas) into His Body, forming the backbone and structure for the church’s purposes. APEST functions are, therefore, implicit in the church’s identity, purpose, culture, and mission, because Jesus is at the heart of the church’s life. 5Q is coded into the very core of the church’s purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5Q as the Church's Operating System</h2>
<p>Reviewing the 5Q framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functions</strong> are located at the OS (organizational system) level.</li>
<li><strong>Callings</strong> are the “apps”—the personal platforms from which the Body empowers all believers to fulfill their unique callings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Body of Christ as a whole is the true recipient of 5Q.</p>
<p>It’s organizational scenius.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Archetypes and Functional Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Archetypes, Images</strong></li>
<li><strong>Latent Patterns, Ideas, Instincts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Heroic Expressions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Functions, Purposes (Implicit)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Callings, Identities (Explicit)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Completed in Christ’s Kingdom—Ephesians 1:22–23</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grounded in God—Romans 11:36</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reconstituted in Jesus</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Let’s Get Functional</h2>
<p>This book focuses on the fivefold functions—and the corresponding dysfunctions that arise from corruption or truncation in the system.</p>
<p>The focus is on the identity and purpose of the church as a collective, rather than individual vocations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional lens:</strong> Explores how organizational culture enables healthy expressions of the fivefold callings.</li>
<li><strong>Vocational lens:</strong> Highlights the need for individuals to develop their unique APEST calling as expressions of the church’s purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal callings—what I call explicit APEST—are the individual, concrete expressions of the underlying functions already embedded in the Body of Christ.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Callings as Expressions of Fivefold Functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calling (Vocation):</strong> Individual and personal expression of the fivefold functions given to the Body.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> Corporate, organizational dimensions of APEST.</li>
<li><strong>Calling:</strong> How each function is expressed through individual believers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Functions and Dysfunction</h2>
<p>Just as the human body relies on the proper functioning of its systems (cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, etc.), so too does the Body of Christ require all five APEST capacities to be fully functional.</p>
<p>Anything less leads to fatigue and dysfunction—akin to running a motor vehicle on less than all cylinders.</p>
<p>Deficiencies or imbalances damage the entire system.</p>
<p>When the church is described as a “body,” it evokes systemic interconnectivity.</p>
<p>For the Body of Christ, function and individual vocation are inextricably related; to remove one undercuts all the others.</p>
<p>We need all five to mature.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every church is called to evangelism; some have specific evangelists.</li>
<li>The role of the evangelist expresses the underlying function given by Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions precede and provide the platform for individual callings.</p>
<p>The individual role makes explicit what is already implicit in the Body.</p>
<p>Even cessationists regarding individual callings must admit that the organizational functions cannot be removed and remain biblical.</p>
<p>The church is always to be apostolic (missional), prophetic, evangelistic, shepherding, and teaching.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Implications of Loss</h3>
<p>Without the:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apostolic:</strong> The missionary purpose is undercut.</li>
<li><strong>Prophetic:</strong> The church fails to confront unfaithfulness, unrighteousness, or injustice.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelistic:</strong> The church loses its obligation to proclaim good news.</li>
<li><strong>Shepherding:</strong> The church loses its community cohesion.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching:</strong> Lacking wisdom and knowledge, the church becomes ineffective or even dangerous.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the Body of Christ, the church is always called to embody all five functions.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Organizational Analogy</h3>
<p>Just as organizations require distinct departments (e.g., product design, marketing, HR), each with distinct functions and roles, so does the church.</p>
<p>Individual roles presuppose the existence of certain functions within the organization.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function:</strong> The actions/activities assigned to a person, thing, or organization—embodying the purposes for which something is designed.</li>
<li><strong>Calling:</strong> The personal sense of vocation, an impulse toward a particular course of action, strongly linked to individual destiny.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Capacities and Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Capacities</li>
<li>Practices</li>
<li>Essentials</li>
<li>Instincts</li>
<li>Senses</li>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>Categories</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Identities</li>
<li>Objectives</li>
<li>Duties</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
<li>Agencies</li>
<li>Generations</li>
<li>Missions</li>
<li>Actions</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Dimensions</li>
<li>Types</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Scope Beyond the Church</h3>
<p>Though articulated here in ecclesial terms, these archetypal functions and callings are latent throughout human culture and can (and should) be expressed in every sphere where disciples live out their faith.</p>
<p>When your spiritual calling intersects with your vocation, you are fulfilling your God-given mission and destiny.</p>
<p>While this book focuses on the church, the fivefold pattern applies in other organizational domains as well.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Defining the APEST Functions</h2>
<p>Let us define each of the fivefold functions and their associated callings.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Apostolic / Apostle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Especially crucial for missional ecclesiology today is the recovery of the apostolic function in the church.”
—Darrell Guder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The apostolic function maintains and develops:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentness:</strong> The church’s sense of mission and extension.</li>
<li><strong>Movement:</strong> The dynamic, advancing, adaptable nature of ecclesia.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose/Mission Focus:</strong> Ongoing emphasis on the church’s mission.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable Organization:</strong> Developing culture for extension and reproduction.</li>
<li><strong>DNA Compliance:</strong> Guarding core identity and message.</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> The “big picture” vision that makes sense of other functions.</li>
<li><strong>Gospel Planting:</strong> Planting the gospel creates new communities.</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> Encouraging innovation and risk-taking.</li>
<li><strong>Translocal Network:</strong> Maintaining communication and healthy regional networks.</li>
<li><strong>Unity and Diversity:</strong> Ensuring unity among growing diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Health:</strong> Maintaining overall system health and function.</li>
<li><strong>Mobilization:</strong> Equipping all believers for missional living.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Apostolic calling/role:</strong>
The apostolic person embodies these instincts and, in its ideal leadership form, maintains the vigor and extension of Christianity (e.g., church planting, movement-starting, missionary leadership, entrepreneurial innovation).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prophetic / Prophet</h2>
<p>The prophetic function has two dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical (God-oriented):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining God-orientation through worship/prayer</li>
<li>Engaging with God's passion (pathos)</li>
<li>Encountering God</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal (World/Other-oriented):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting covenant obligations</li>
<li>Reminding of God's love</li>
<li>Calling to repentance</li>
<li>Speaking truth to power</li>
<li>Sensitivity to spiritual warfare</li>
<li>Distinguishing true and false worship (idolatry)</li>
<li>Championing justice</li>
<li>Calling to holiness</li>
<li>Communicating urgency</li>
<li>Demonstrating prefigurative community</li>
<li>Enabling learning through questioning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prophetic calling/role:</strong>
Prophets listen to God, see as He sees, and act on His behalf—often agitating for change in the name of faithfulness.</p>
<p>They are “heart revealers,” worship leaders, artists, agitators, activists, and agents of justice.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Evangelistic / Evangelist</h2>
<p>The evangelistic function relates to the church as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicator:</strong> Articulates and shares the unfolding story of the church.</li>
<li><strong>Responder:</strong> Elicits a positive response to the message.</li>
<li><strong>Inviter:</strong> Creates an invitational and welcoming culture.</li>
<li><strong>Movement-Spreader:</strong> Infectiously shares the core message.</li>

<li><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> Articulates the value of belonging to Christ.</li>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Manages how the church is perceived.</li>
<li><strong>Valuer of Individuals:</strong> Sees individuals as vital in God’s network.</li>
<li><strong>Catalytic Witness:</strong> Demonstrates good news in word, sign, and deed.</li>
<li><strong>Recruiter:</strong> Draws people into the cause.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evangelistic calling/role:</strong>
Evangelists are exceptional recruiters, connectors, and persuaders—agents of conversion, and bridges between church and world.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Shepherding / Shepherd</h2>
<p>The shepherding function exists to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enrich Community:</strong> Enhance communal experience.</li>

<li><strong>Enable Flourishing:</strong> Create environments where people thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Foster Family:</strong> Help reconcile individuals as a redeemed family.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Community:</strong> Nurture relationships marked by Christlike love.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shepherding calling/role:</strong>
Shepherds create and maintain healthy communities, paying close attention to people’s stories and fostering unity, cohesion, empathy, and care.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Teaching / Teacher</h2>
<p>The teaching function is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom and Understanding:</strong> Cultivating curiosity, interpreting Scripture.</li>
<li><strong>Worldview Formation:</strong> Developing a biblically congruent philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Love of Scripture:</strong> Revealing its complexity and beauty.</li>
<li><strong>Theological Discourse:</strong> Ensuring ongoing God-talk.</li>
<li><strong>Resources for Learning:</strong> Communicating ideas and tools.</li>

<li><strong>Idea Transmission:</strong> Passing on worldview and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Traditioning:</strong> Handing down teachings across generations.</li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Learning:</strong> Creating pathways for continued transformation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching calling/role:</strong>
Teachers guide others toward insight and practical wisdom, shaping the consciousness of God’s people and participating in the truth they impart.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Bringing it All Together</h2>
<p>Summarizing the APEST in table form (for further detail and functions/roles, see the above text):</p>
<p>| APEST Function | Purpose/Function Examples | Calling/Role Examples | | --- | --- | --- | | Apostolic/Apostle | Missional leadership, movement extension, DNA care | Movement starters, church planters, architects | | Prophetic/Prophet | God-orientation, justice, reform, holy imagination | Activists, worship leaders, questioners | | Evangelistic/Evangelist | Communicate message, invite, cultural connection | Recruiters, event directors, connectors | | Shepherding/Shepherd | Community, inclusion, healing, formation | Pastoral carers, social workers, counselors | | Teaching/Teacher | Wisdom, formation, resource development, tradition | Instructors, mentors, guides, truth-tellers |</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Power of Functionality</h2>
<p>If a church finds a way to cover all these functions, it will become rich, healthy, and truly expressing the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>All five are already present, by virtue of Christ’s word—they are the latent seed of the system.</p>
<p>The focus, then, should not be on trying to generate the seed—instead, create environments that will allow it to flourish.</p>
<p>Fivefold health is all about symmetry, proportion, and interdependence.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>When one function is diminished, the Body is compromised.
—Summary Principle</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>*The above marks the end of this section.</p>
<p>The next section will explore the nature of fivefold functions and callings in greater practical detail, and why the health and mission of the church depend on them.*</p>
<h2>[Chapter 7] Dysfunction and Maturity in the Body: The Need for Fivefold Balance</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"If a function (or person) dominates the others, it must have a detrimental effect on the whole Body."</p>
<p>—Briggs &#x26; Hyatt</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Danger of Dominant Functions</h2>
<p>Briggs and Hyatt observe that churches led predominantly by one type of leader, or characterized by a single dominant function, infuse the entire ministry and spirituality of the congregation with that trait.</p>
<p>This creates an unhealthy bias and disrupts the spiritual ecology of Jesus’ body.</p>
<h3>Examples of Unbalanced Churches</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apostolic Bias</strong></li>
<li>Strengths: Break new ground, innovative, adventurous.</li>
<li>Dangers: If dominant, becomes overly task-driven, demanding, and alienating.</li>
<li><strong>Prophetic Bias</strong></li>
<li>Strengths: Speak truth to power, justice-oriented, passionate in worship and discernment.</li>
<li>Dangers: If dominant, can become judgmental, overcritical, and unstable.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelistic Bias</strong></li>
<li>Strengths: Heart for the lost, strong emphasis on outreach.</li>
<li>Dangers: If dominant, leans on marketing, can be shallow, pushy, opinionated, and aggressive.</li>
<li><strong>Shepherding Bias</strong></li>
<li>Strengths: Loving, caring, relational.</li>
<li>Dangers: If dominant, risks becoming risk-averse, exclusive, overprotective, cloying, and co-dependent.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching Bias</strong></li>
<li>Strengths: Wise, informed, committed to discipleship.</li>
<li>Dangers: If dominant, tends toward intellectualism, control, fussiness, and equates spirituality with knowledge rather than practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, dominance leads to "precocious development"—an imbalance akin to a child overdeveloped in one area, to the detriment of holistic maturity.[^25] This over-reliance on strengths masks deeper immaturity, requiring intentional healing and integration.[^26]</p>
<h2>One-Dimensional Organization: The Problem of Reductionism</h2>
<p>A leader or church with a precocious bias interprets all problems and solutions through their own lens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apostolic solution:</strong> More leadership training and church planting.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching solution:</strong> More preaching and Bible study.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelistic solution:</strong> Bigger and better Sunday services.</li>
</ul>
<p>This reductionism, often focused on sermons or Sunday events, ignores other vital functions such as discipleship, mission, and covenant community, resulting in disordered and immature expressions of the church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is reductionism at its worst!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At best, this creates a narrow, obsessive focus; at worst, it can lead to groupthink, dysfunction, and even cult-like tendencies.</p>
<h2>The Call for Integration</h2>
<p>For authentic growth, each APEST (Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherding, Teaching) function needs the others (Ephesians 4:12–16).</p>
<p>True maturity arises from integration—a "symphony" of all five dimensions.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Asymmetrical Churches Asymmetrical churches attract like-minded individuals, which further entrenches their bias.</h3>
<p>For example, a teaching-focused church attracts those who only value teaching and alienates other forms of spiritual expression, resulting in groupthink or mass delusion.</p>
<h2>Summary Table: The Fivefold Functions and Callings</h2>
<p>Below is an abridged summary of the APEST functions and how they manifest across Scripture, in creation, and in the Church (see original text for full detail):</p>
<p>| Function | Archetypes/Heroes | In Christ | Functions in Church | Practitioners/Callings | |---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------| | Apostolic | Founder, Pioneer | Sent One, King | Missional leadership | Church planters, Innovators, Entrepreneurs | | Prophetic | Seer, Reformer | Prophet, Word | Covenant conscience | Social activists, Worship leaders, Ethical leaders| | Evangelistic | Messenger, Champion| Redeemer, Savior | Outreach &#x26; recruitment | Communicators, Apologists | | Shepherding | Caregiver, Healer | Good Shepherd | Community builder | Counselors, Spiritual directors | | Teaching | Sage, Guide | Rabbi, Logos | Curriculum &#x26; doctrine | Instructors, Writers, Theologians |</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Each of the five major functions is critically important to the health of the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each actually needs the other to make the whole work. (The church really is a body after all.)" When churches have neglected evangelism, prophecy, and apostolicity—elevating only teaching and shepherding—the Body suffers.</p>
