<h1>Chapter 5: The Hero's Journey—The Movement That Jesus Started</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to know who God is, look at Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to know what it means to be human, look at Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to know what love is, look at Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to know what grief is, look at Jesus.</p>
<p>And go on looking until you’re not just a spectator, but you’re actually part of the drama which has him as the central character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—N. T.</p>

<p>Wright</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our heroes carry our aspirations, our ideals, our hopes, our beliefs … This is what makes heroism so important: it reflects our own sense of identity, our combined emotions, our myths.</p>
<p>—Rollo May</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since man could not come to God, God has come to man, identifying himself with man in the most direct way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eternal Logos and Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, has become true man, one of us; he has healed and restored our humanity by taking the whole of it into himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—Kallistos Ware</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An exploration of archetypes in human society parallels the idea that "myths" are foundational to both personal and group identity.</p>
<p>Joseph Campbell famously demonstrated the enduring power of primary myths (defining narratives) throughout history.</p>
<p>One key myth, which Campbell called the "mono-myth" or "the hero’s journey," is especially relevant to understanding the role of Jesus.</p>
<p>Heroes—whether real or mythical, living or departed—embody qualities prized by their society and serve as behavioral models.</p>
<p>According to Campbell and others (such as C. S.</p>
<p>Lewis, J. R. R.</p>
<p>Tolkien, and Christopher Vogler), the hero’s journey follows a recognizable pattern and structure, present in all great stories—from Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to Lewis' <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em>.</p>
<h2>The Structure of the Hero's Journey</h2>
<p>Campbell identifies three main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quest (Departure):</strong> The hero is summoned and sent, embarking on the journey. 2. <strong>Ordeal:</strong> The hero faces initiation, wounding, battles, setbacks, and various adventures. 3. <strong>Return:</strong> The hero comes home with the "elixir of life"—special knowledge or powers gained on the journey.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.</p>
<p>—Joseph Campbell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ancient narrative holds profound significance for every culture.</p>
<p>It permeates history, religion, and culture itself.</p>
<p>Hans Urs von Balthasar writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Divine grace … is secretly at work in the whole sphere of history, and thus all myths, philosophies, and poetic creations are innately capable of housing within themselves an intimation of divine glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Gospel as the Culmination of Archetypal Myth</h2>
<p>Paul, particularly in his apostolic-missionary role, recognized the religious significance of myth as a metaphor for Christ’s death and resurrection.</p>
<p>In Acts 17:16–34, he references a myth of a dying and rising god—likely Ceres, worshipped as the Corn King, believed to die and rise with each season.</p>
<p>Paul uses this narrative logic to draw a direct parallel to the story of Jesus, leveraging the abiding value of mono-myth as a metaphor for the gospel.</p>
<p>C. S.</p>
<p>Lewis, reflecting on myth and theology, notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In theology as in science, myth supplies not answers but an experience of a larger existence than we can know cognitively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an experience touches depths the intellect cannot reach and conveys, to children and adults alike, the sense that this is not just true, but Truth.</p>
<p>J. R. R.</p>
<p>Tolkien once suggested to Lewis that the gospel appears as a reframing of the Corn King myth, because "Christ was a myth that had become fact." Christ lived—and so fulfilled—the myth hidden within every culture.</p>
<p>As Lewis scholar Louis Marcos writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the reason that every ancient culture yearned for a god to come to earth, to die, and to rise again was because the Creator who made all the nations placed in every person a desire for this very thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is so, it makes sense that when God enacted salvation through Jesus, it resonated with the deepest longing placed in all people.</p>
<h2>The Hero's Journey in Jesus</h2>
<p>Once we acknowledge this archetypal pattern, the hero’s journey is unmistakably evident in Jesus’ story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jesus is sent on a mission, embodying the APEST identities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>He suffers, labors, and gains followers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>He overcomes and achieves victory.</strong></li>
<li><strong>He bestows blessing—the fivefold gifts—upon his followers.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a word, Jesus is our true "hero" and the primary Christian prototype, "the heroic form, perfected man in whose image we are being remade" (see 2 Corinthians 3:18).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Jesus as Triumphant King: The Ascension and the Gifts to the Church</h2>
<p>Having identified the creational archetypes of APEST and the stages of the hero’s journey, we can now address what Paul calls the "ascension gifting" in Ephesians 4:8–11.</p>
<h2>The Ascension Gifting Explained</h2>
<p>The imagery in Ephesians 4:8–10 is drawn from public rituals of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>When a ruler or general returned victorious from battle, the city celebrated with a triumphal parade.</p>
<p>The champion displayed the spoils of war and distributed bounty among the people.</p>
<p>The triumphal arches found in cities originated from this practice.</p>
<p>Paul adopts this archetype to describe Christ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus "descends" into the world, is victorious, "takes captivity captive," and in his "ascension" leads a parade, bestowing gifts upon his people.</li>
<li>Jesus appropriates and redeems the unredeemed APEST archetypes from creation and remodels them in his own image.</li>
<li>These "victory gifts" are then permanently bestowed upon the church, like a living testament to his triumph.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that Paul connects APEST to the Ascension—a key event in Christ’s resurrection, enthronement, and commissioning of the church—gives APEST substantial theological weight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore there can be no other basis for Christian discipleship and ministry than the resurrection; for it is none less than the ascending and exalted Head of the Church and of mankind who distributes the charisms [gifts] and missions of discipleship (Ephesians 4:7–11).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Recapitulation: Reconfiguring the System</h2>
<p>With the hero’s journey established in the pattern of Jesus’ sending, descent, and ascent, we turn to how he redeems these archetypes for the church.</p>
<p>This is rooted in the New Testament teaching of <strong>anakephalaiosis</strong> (Greek; recapitulation in Latin).</p>
<p>Irenaeus and the early church fathers developed this doctrine: Christ, as the new representative man (the Second Adam), succeeds where the first Adam failed.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[God’s purpose is, in] the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up [Gk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anakephalaiosis, literally “to restore in the new head”] of all things in Christ, things in the heavens, and things on the earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—Ephesians 1:10 (NASB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul similarly formulates the gospel in terms of recapitulation in Colossians 1:15–23 and Romans 5.</p>
<p>Stanley Hauerwas observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The confession that the Messiah has been placed by God above and not within the cosmology and culture of the world means that under his lordship the cosmos finds its true meaning and coherence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Colossians the powers are rightly understood to be not merely defeated but reenlisted in their original purpose to praise God.</p>
<p>Jesus consecrates history and culture in his own authentic living.</p>
<p>Peter Leithart calls Jesus "the Father’s summary statement … the Logos of the Father—the logic or purpose in and through which the whole divine economy is conceived and implemented." N. T.</p>
<p>Wright, following Irenaeus, says Christ acts as the representative who reconstitutes the people of God.</p>
<p>Humanity is restored and history rebooted in Christ.</p>
<h2>Recapitulation and APEST</h2>
<p>Applying this to 5Q: Along with all dimensions of humanity, the fivefold APEST archetypes are taken up into Christ, redeemed, and reconfigured through his perfect life and sacrificial death.</p>
<p>In recapitulation, Christ becomes the new Head (<em>kephale</em>, <em>caput</em>) and is called the Head of his Body, the church (Ephesians 4:15).</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:8–11 teaches that Jesus takes the pre-existing fivefold archetypes and, recapitulating them in true obedience to God, gives APEST its definitive expression.</p>
<p>Jesus embodies APEST as God originally intended, sanctifying and reconsecrating the fallen archetypes.</p>
<p>In so doing, he "gifts" them to the Body of Christ, embedding them within the church’s genetic code as expressions of unique callings in different people across time and cultures.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Jesus Offers the World Back to the Father</h2>
<p>It is fitting within monotheistic logic to see worship as offering the world back to God.</p>
<p>Recapitulation is where Jesus reconsecrates all humanity—including the fivefold archetypes—and presents it all as worship to God.</p>
<p>The church is central to this offering that Jesus, as High Priest, makes to the Father.</p>
<p>Through the redemptive ministry of the Body of Christ, Jesus extends his own mission in the world (cf.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22–23; 1 Corinthians 15:21–28).</p>
<p>By ascending to the Father, Jesus bequeaths the reconstituted APEST archetypes to the community called to be his embodiment.</p>
<p>We are perfectly equipped to live out his purposes.</p>
<p>Each of us must remember the enormity of the grace we have received and live into his intentions.</p>
<p>If we neglect or distort the fivefold, we risk undermining the very design of the church and introducing a fatal flaw into its life and capacities.</p>
