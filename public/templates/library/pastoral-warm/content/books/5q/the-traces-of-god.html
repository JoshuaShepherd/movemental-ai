<h1>Chapter 3: The Traces of God</h1>
<p>The forms of archetypes, myths, and hero-expression were evident in society long before the earthly ministry of Jesus and remain present in contemporary society beyond the church. I believe this is highly significant to the mission and effectiveness of God’s people everywhere. <strong>APEST</strong> is not exclusive to churches or Christian organizations.</p>
<p>The fivefold functions, intelligences, or capacities are not limited to the faith community nor do they emerge solely upon conversion.</p>
<p>Rather, there is a noticeable correlation between APEST as it is expressed in the church and other generic functions in broader human culture and history—a concept we might call “non-church APEST.”</p>
<p>The idea that God shapes our lives before conversion is consistent with biblical understandings of calling; both Paul and Jeremiah state that they were called to their respective roles before birth (Galatians 1:15–16; Jeremiah 1:5).</p>
<p>Reflecting on my own life, I discern clear roots of my calling long before I recognized its significance within faith.</p>
<p>No doubt, you can do the same.</p>
<p>While APEST brings enhanced, distinct meanings in the Jesus movement, there is more continuity than difference.</p>
<p>The fivefold typology is, in some sense, a category universal to humankind.</p>
<p>Therefore, APEST is much larger—and far more important—than previously imagined.</p>

<h2>The Gifts of God</h2>
<p>Any attempt to restrict God’s gifts to “spiritual” gifts (imparted after conversion) disregards the breadth of Scripture’s perspective on God’s gifts to creation and his people.</p>
<p>Human culture and achievement reflect the astonishing variety and diversity of God’s design, intention, and ongoing work in everyone.</p>
<p>God bestows creation-gifts in every conceivable form and manner.</p>
<p>Beyond natural gifts, humans are endowed with an amazing array of physical, artistic, and intellectual abilities, intelligences, and possibilities.</p>
<p>God's original and ongoing intention is for every person, with their unique gifts and abilities, to serve as instruments of blessing for others.</p>
<p>Each person has a gift, task, place, and role—a channel of creative goodness (Matthew 7:11; James 1:17).</p>
<p>The fundamental logic behind all creational gifts is rooted in God’s blessing: gifts are meant to be received, appropriated, and shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans as image-bearers are commissioned to exercise godly stewardship over creation—a concept theologians call “the cultural mandate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humans are to carry out God’s will for creation and embody his concern for the flourishing of all life, acting as co-laborers with God.</p>
<p>This <strong>creation gifting and mandate</strong> applies universally—to Christian and non-Christian alike.</p>
<h3>The "Masks of God" and Archetype in Culture</h3>
<p>God’s goodness can be experienced “incognito” across creation.</p>
<p>Martin Luther termed this the “masks of God,” or what the Latin Fathers call <em>vestigia Dei</em> (the traces of God)—signs of God’s existence and being, embedded in creation.</p>
<p>These “traces” are evidence of the Creator, who reveals himself as the source and goal of all paths.</p>
<p>God paradoxically both conceals and reveals himself “in, with, and under” Creation.</p>
<p>These traces are visible in human acts of goodness, as well as in art, science, education, family, politics, law, marriage, recreation, and more.</p>
<p>Since everything derives from God, all creaturely being can be seen as an indicative utterance about God.</p>

<h2>Archetypes, Heroes, and the Orders of Creation</h2>
<h3>What Are Archetypes?</h3>
<p><strong>Archetypes</strong> are mysterious, recurrent symbols, values, or motifs deeply latent in all story, art, thought, and action.</p>
<p>The word derives from the Greek <em>arche</em>—“beginning,” “origin,” or “source of action” (cf.</p>
<p>John 1:1–3).</p>
<p>An <em>arche</em> is a formative aspect at the roots of something; archetypes are primordial ideas that shape our world experience.</p>
<p>People across cultures and eras dream of common themes—God, life, death, good and evil, love.</p>
<p>These experiences often transcend language.</p>
<p>Thus, archetypes exist in individual (conscious and subconscious) experiences and are recreated in arts and literature.</p>
<h4>Influence Across Disciplines</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Archetypes, or “first principles,” are considered the basis of knowledge itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of Plato’s “forms” and “universals.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biology:</strong> Instincts or “fixed action patterns” are archetypal behaviors preprogrammed into animal (and human) species.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology &#x26; Sociology:</strong> Archetypes operate from within the collective unconscious, the social imaginary, or the <em>habitus</em> of culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because archetypes are deeply woven into the human soul and culture, they feel familiar—more remembered than learned—and motivate action, acting as what many call “the Culture Code.”</p>
<h4>Historical and Cultural Patterns</h4>
<p>Patterns such as royalty, democracies, marriage, city-building, law—recurring across history—are archetypal forces or “memes.” In literature and art, archetypes wield strong mythical influence.</p>
<p>Superheroes and arch-villains in comics often trace their lineage to Greek myth, sacred texts, and universal hero narratives—including the Bible.</p>
<p>There are archetypal cities, such as Sodom, Babylon, and Rome, that serve as metaphors for decadence; or Jerusalem/Zion as the ideal community.</p>
<p>Organizational archetypes—Explorer, Caregiver, Genius—also pervade branding and societal roles.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Bible and Archetypes</h2>
<p>Biblical literature not only employs existing archetypes, but provides language to recognize and categorize them, notably through teachings on <em>powers and principalities</em>.</p>
<h3>Biblical Terms for Foundational Forces</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Arche</em> – Foundational forces</li>
<li><em>Exousia</em> – Authorities/powers</li>
<li><em>Stoicheia</em> – Elemental spirits/principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul discusses these spiritual and cultural forces in Colossians 1:16–17.</p>
<p>Like instinctive archetypes, they continue to influence, direct, and even coerce human behavior.</p>
<p>These forces manifest across religion, society, and culture, both angelic and demonic, in institutions, ideologies, and social systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>—Colossians 1:16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While many powers are fallen, the Bible asserts their legitimacy comes from creation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, through Christ, they are reconciled and realigned with the Kingdom (Colossians 1:19–20, 2:15–23).</p>
<h3>Archetypes Fulfilled in Christ</h3>
<p>Hans Urs von Balthasar observes that all spiritual archetypes converge in Christ and are fulfilled in the Body of Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Archetypes] do not hover over the Body as unattainable ideas, but, rather, each in its own way ... these archetypal experiences are the very foundation of the life-form of believing man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The Hero: Living Expression of the Archetype</h2>
<p>Heroes—individuals or organizations—serve as role models and ideal expressions of archetypes embedded in a culture’s myths and aspirations.</p>
<p>They reflect collective identity and become standards of action.</p>
<p>Societies require heroes to pass on cultural “genes” and embody communal vision.</p>
<p>Saints, for example (Hebrews 11), are spiritual heroes making faith more attainable for others.</p>
<p>The mythology apparent in most films emerges through archetypal imagery brought to life by the hero.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>Divergent</em> series uses five factions—mirroring APEST—highlighting the need for unity among diverse strengths.</p>
