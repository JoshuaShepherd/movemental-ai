<h2>Learning by Process, Not Just by Answers</h2>
<p>We often want quick answers, but transformation requires learning the process, not just arriving at the right answer.</p>
<p>As illustrated in teaching a child math: it's more valuable to show the process than to simply supply the answer.</p>
<p>Apply this lesson to church leadership: lasting, fruitful change comes by embracing new theological paradigms and praxis, not just programs or manuals.</p>
<p>Changing structures may take months; changing culture takes years—and it starts with us.</p>
<h2>Embracing Change: The Challenge</h2>
<p>As you reflect on what you’ve learned, ask these key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you willing to relinquish the security of old thinking and adopt "soft eyes"?</li>
<li>Will you courageously change, not just personally but communally and organizationally?</li>
<li>Are you willing to pay the price to “learn again”?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step on this journey is repentance—a willingness to expand your thinking and adopt new truth.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Stop, Look, Listen</h2>
<p>Repentance is more than turning from sin; it means to "open your mind" or "expand your thinking" (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p>Like the Green Cross Code in England:
<strong>Stop, Look, and Listen</strong> before responding to new situations or information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop:</strong> Pause your rush to act or to resist new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Look:</strong> Observe your context, yourself, and others with fresh eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Listen:</strong> Be attentive to how God may be speaking or leading.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reflection, step out and act on the new truth—"believe the good news." Learning means not just understanding, but applying, innovating, and multiplying (per Bloom's taxonomy).</p>
<p><strong>5Q Challenge:</strong>
Write in your journal, reflect, pray, walk, read—do what you need to Stop, Look, and Listen for God’s truth.</p>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is God saying to expand your thinking?</li>
<li>Where are you stuck or have settled for less?</li>
<li>How can this new understanding help you or others grow?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps for the 5Q Journey</h2>
<p>The journey of living out 5Q is not for the faint-hearted; it is stretching and rewarding.</p>
<p>Here are key ways to begin:</p>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>Be Like a Child</p>
<p>Approach learning and challenge with childlike curiosity and faith—a spirit of exploration and experimentation, not rigid classroom learning.</p>
<p>Children engage fully, learn through experience, and maintain "soft eyes" that see possibilities.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>Be a Padawan</p>
<p>Embrace the posture of an apprentice.</p>
<p>Like the disciples who learned by watching and following their teacher, we must move beyond information transfer to personal, relational, and experiential learning.</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p>Be a Long-Distance Runner</p>
<p>Transformation results from repeated, intentional practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Do new things intentionally, even if it feels awkward.</li>
<li><strong>Habit</strong>: Continued practice becomes your default pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Eventually, right practices become second nature—unconsciously competent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>Be an Explorer</p>
<p>An explorer relies on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Map:</strong> Understanding and orientation (theory and information from this book).</li>
<li><strong>A Guide:</strong> A mentor who has journeyed before.</li>
<li><strong>A Destination:</strong> A compelling vision.</li>
<li><strong>A Compass:</strong> The Holy Spirit guiding direction and pace.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>Be an Architect</p>
<p>Long-term change requires building strong foundations.</p>
<p>Consider the five marks of the church (chapter eight):</p>
<ul>
<li>Missional impact (A)</li>
<li>Covenant faithfulness (P)</li>
<li>Gospel proclamation (E)</li>
<li>Reconciled community (S)</li>
<li>Deep wisdom (T)</li>
</ul>
<p>Intentionally engage and grow in all five marks, set solid foundations, and seek out "master builders" to deepen your competencies.</p>

<h2>Final Encouragements</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't be overwhelmed. Begin with one or two sustainable steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Journey with Others:</strong> Don't travel alone. Identify mentors and companions for prayer, encouragement, and accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Connected:</strong> Engage with others journeying with 5Q through resources and training via <a href="http://www.5qcentral.com">5Qcentral.com</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.”</em></p>
