<h2>Personal APEST Portrait</h2>
<p>This tool focuses on developing an individual “portrait” or profile of each person’s calling by ranking APEST functions in descending order.</p>
<p>The most statistically reliable method is to take the online test at <a href="http://www.apest.org">aptest.org</a> (also accessible via <a href="http://www.5qcentral.com">5Qcentral.com</a>).</p>
<p>However, a communal discernment process is equally enriching. I highly recommend both the test and the group process.</p>
<p><strong>Before coming together as a group, each member should:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect personally on their APEST giftings (Ephesians 4:7).</li>
<li>Using the agreed definitions (see page 99), identify their primary or dominant calling and secondary calling.</li>
<li>Fill out the provided diagram: place your primary APEST gifting in the largest circle, the secondary in the next largest, and so on.</li>
<li>Reflect on life events that connect to your profile.</li>
<li>After filling in the circles, take the online test to confirm or refine your impressions.</li>
<li>Journal insights to share with the group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When gathering as a group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide up to 30 minutes for each member to share their portrait, feelings, and rationale.</li>
<li>The leader should model this first.</li>
<li>The group gives honest, loving feedback: is the portrait accurate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Can the community confirm or help refine the individual’s depiction?</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust the portrait as appropriate.</li>
<li>Pray for and affirm each person's calling, encouraging greater self-awareness and impact.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>_“APEST is called a Body dynamic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We only truly know ourselves in relation to others—in community.”_</p>

<h2>APEST Thinking Hats</h2>
<p>Inspired by Edward de Bono's <em>Six Thinking Hats</em>, this exercise teaches teams to approach problems through the lens of each APEST function, without labeling people vocationally.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Define a team problem. 2.</p>
<p>Work through the five thinking hats, each representing an APEST function: - <strong>A (Apostle):</strong> Missional extension, guarding the gospel, multiplication. - <strong>P (Prophet):</strong> Truth-telling, cultural depth. - <strong>E (Evangelist):</strong> Sharing the gospel, engaging outsiders. - <strong>S (Shepherd):</strong> Caring, nurturing, inclusion. - <strong>T (Teacher):</strong> Systematic truth, wisdom. 3.</p>
<p>Each member must think from each perspective, regardless of their own vocational gift. 4.</p>
<p>As a group, take turns wearing each conceptual hat and explore solutions accordingly.</p>
<p><em>The game-like quality removes defensiveness and ensures all perspectives are heard.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Base and Phase</h2>
<p>This tool helps individuals identify both their primary ("base") APEST gifting and the "phases" in which they have functioned in other APEST roles.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base:</strong> Your primary, most comfortable ministry gifting.</li>
<li><strong>Phase:</strong> Other APEST roles you have operated in during different seasons, often prompted by circumstances or God’s guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul says the purpose of APEST is equipping for maturity (see Ephesians 4:12).</p>
<p>Everyone is encouraged to grow beyond their base, embracing other functions for well-rounded maturity.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place your base ministry in the center of a diagram.</li>
<li>Note phases of ministry experience in the surrounding circles.</li>
<li>Briefly describe your growth experiences related to each phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>_We are rarely in control of which phase we enter; circumstances or relationships often guide this.</p>
<p>Remain open to new phases and seek out opportunities to learn from others._</p>

<h2>APEST Inventory</h2>
<p>The APEST Inventory helps churches and organizations inventory their activities and functions through the fivefold lens.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Review the functions list (see page 99). 2.</p>
<p>List all major activities of the church/organization. 3. <strong>Tag</strong> each activity as: - A (Apostolic) - P (Prophetic) - E (Evangelistic) - S (Shepherd) - T (Teacher) You can apply primary and secondary tags (e.g., “Ea” for evangelistic primary, apostolic secondary). 4.</p>
<p>Chart these on a visual diagram. 5.</p>
<p>Assess concentrations, deficiencies, and overall symmetry or asymmetry in the system. 6.</p>
<p>Discuss causes and ways to fill gaps.</p>
<p><em>Some churches, like Northwood Baptist Church, have cell groups check off activities related to all five functions during the year to cultivate balanced, mature ecclesias.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>APEST Perspectives</h2>
<p>This tool encourages teams to approach topics through multiple fivefold perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Place an object, idea, or challenge (e.g., "gospel", "church", "culture") at the center. 2.</p>
<p>Each participant describes what they see from their dominant APEST profile. 3.</p>
<p>Group discussion reveals different facets, emphasizing the necessity of multiple perspectives for a full, accurate understanding.</p>
<p><em>Use this tool for core values, problem-solving, planning, communication, or strategy building.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>APEST Pipeline</h2>
<p>This exercise helps teams paint a picture of a competent practitioner of each of the five APEST callings and map processes for discipleship.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Profile the ideal attitude, behaviors, skills, and competencies for each APEST calling. 2.</p>
<p>Consider potential blockages or challenges for each in the training process. 3.</p>
<p>Develop curriculum/content and a model process for discipling others into these callings. 4.</p>
<p>Articulate core competencies required to "graduate" to the next level. 5.</p>
<p>Transfer theory through coaching and practice to mastery.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Development Levels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level Five:</strong> Mature, able to equip others.</li>
<li><strong>Level Four:</strong> Able to lead.</li>
<li><strong>Level Three:</strong> Able to fulfill all basic tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Level Two:</strong> Personal awareness of vocation.</li>
<li><strong>Level One:</strong> The undefined disciple.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach supports tailored but not individualistic development—always with the goal of organizational maturity.</p>
<p><strong>Example (Levels Two &#x26; Three):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apostle:</strong> Mobilize action, pioneer new missional frontiers, focus on impact.</li>
<li><strong>Prophet:</strong> Help hear and know truth, foster cultural integrity, focus on faithfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Evangelist:</strong> Encourage gospel sharing, equip others, focus on communication.</li>
<li><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Nurture, demonstrate God’s love, focus on inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> Create depth and accessibility in truth, focus on learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>APEST Training Environments</h2>
<p>To engage with 5Q on an organizational level, consider the three primary training environments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Classroom</strong> Structured teaching on APEST callings and functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apprenticeship</strong> Relational training, where more mature leaders apprentice others in the same or different APEST callings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immersion</strong> Experiential learning by entering environments where a particular function is dominant or where there is a healthy fivefold balance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Utilizing all three is vital for fruitful development of leaders in a 5Q environment.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Assessing APEST Culture</h2>
<p>A healthy 5Q culture requires attention to both structure and culture.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of APEST Culture:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Grounded:</strong> Are all five functions understood? 2. <strong>Holistic:</strong> Are all five present? 3. <strong>Balanced:</strong> Are all five working together? 4. <strong>Fruitful:</strong> Are all five accessing synergy and leveraging strengths? 5. <strong>Multiplying:</strong> Are all five recreating themselves?</li>
</ol>
<p>A healthy culture will show all five layers and move the organization—together—toward maturity.</p>
<hr>
<h2>From Knowledge to Discipleship</h2>
<p>Biblical teaching emphasizes not just knowing about God, but knowing God—and obedience is the sign of true understanding (Matthew 7:26; James 1:23).</p>
<p>This obedience and imitation leads to discipleship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As Jesus’ disciple, I am his apprentice in kingdom living. I am learning from him how to lead my life in the Kingdom of the Heavens as he would lead my life if he were I.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been given APEST by Jesus to mature and attain his fullness.</p>
<p>It is not enough to acknowledge the fivefold as good theology; we must commit ourselves to this logic and let it shape the Body.</p>
