<h2>With Thanks To…</h2>
<p>This eBook is free to download thanks to the very generous support of some wonderful sponsor organizations:</p>
<p><strong>Exponential</strong> Thank you Todd, Lindy, Terri, Karen and team for all of your fantastic support, encouragement and practical wisdom in the evolution of this eBook. I consider you more as friends and not just as comrades in ministry. I am deeply grateful for y'all.</p>
<p><strong>Quad W</strong> I love the vision of Quad W, which grew out of the death of a young hero and has gone on to be a fantastic experience for young people wanting to explore missional lifestyle. Don Wooley, you are a total gem of a man. Love you.</p>
<p><strong>Go2 Network</strong> Tim Boal, Steve Leston and Dru Dodson have become close friends (we call it the "bubbahood"). But honestly, I find in Go2 Network a group of people who really understand the issues of mission and movement. They are real allies in the cause of our time.</p>
<p><strong>Seedbed</strong> J. D. Walt has had a vision for earnest discipleship for a long time. Seedbed, powered by Asbury Seminary and in the wake of John Wesley, is a fresh voice for today's Church. Seedbed seeks to resource men and women to reach beyond salvation and into shaping others into the image of Christ. They will be a major catalyst for keeping mission and discipleship in tight tension, wherever they find themselves. I am grateful to be a part of their conference in Tennessee this September.</p>
<p><strong>Wheaton College</strong> I have had the privilege of designing a degree with Dr. Rick Richardson from Wheaton College called the M. A. in Missional Church Movements. I consider Wheaton to be one of the premier colleges and seminaries in this country. It's a privilege to partner with them.</p>
<p><strong>Future Travelers</strong> You have this tremendous focus on helping church leaders be more effective in doing ministry, guiding them to a better "how." What a great passion to have. It has been fun partnering with you over the last few years. I look forward to continuing to shape the future.</p>
<p><strong>Forge Mission Training Network</strong> Forge will always remain a wonderful part of my life. I am amazed at how the new International aspects of the movement are taking off in the least expected places. The Forge U.S. team has been particularly diligent in getting things off the ground and creating an impact across the nation. I not only love you all, but also honor you all.</p>
<p><strong>The Aspen Group</strong> Ed Bahler has been one of my dearest friends and supporters in my time in the U.S. I have had the privilege of seeing how he has guided The Aspen Group to become a major support for churches wishing to pursue the missional journey. Thanks for your fine work.</p>
<h2>And Finally…</h2>
<p>I want to specially dedicate this eBook to Kim and Maria Hammond. What amazing people you are. I continue to thank God for you, and I stand in awe of what God can achieve through your big-hearted love and service. Get better Kim, we need your vision and energy.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Given that I have previously written about the strategic need for discipleship and disciple making in The Forgotten Ways and written specifically on the spiritual dynamics of discipleship in Untamed (with my wife, Deb), I tend to get asked a few questions.</p>
<p>Mostly, the questions reflect a fair bit of ignorance of the meaning and significance of disciple making, as well as a loss of ability to even articulate what is involved (context); what the end game is (agenda); as well as how to actually do it (practice).</p>
<p>I have to admit that I find this ignorance pretty alarming given that from any fair reading of the New Testament itself, discipleship and disciple making lay at the very heart of the church’s gospel mandate in the world.</p>
<p>Of all the things we have chosen to remember over 2,000 years—all those little doctrinal quirks, the inexplicable religious rituals, and those pesky marginal traditions that we perpetuate in the church—we have somehow managed to all but forget the essential gospel mandate to make disciples of the nations. How is this possible? How have we effectively managed to purge from church practice all but the faintest traces of one of the most central purposes and practices of the original church? It's a fair bet to assume that the overwhelming majority of Christians are not even aware of a call to discipleship and what it entails—let alone what it means to submit themselves to its joys and demands.</p>
<p>But this issue is important for a whole host of reasons: Because discipleship is intrinsic to the life of the Church and a central aspect of the Church's mission in the world (Matt. 28:19-20), then its effective removal in our church's ministry must surely be a cause of much of the problems we now face. How can we possibly be the Church that Jesus intended us to be if we don’t follow one of the central aspects of His practice, let alone obey His explicit commands? How indeed?</p>
<p>Over the years, I have found myself having to talk about a distinctly missional understanding of discipleship. I actually find this a bit odd. The very fact that we now have to put qualifications on the word “discipleship” again signals how far we have veered from a biblical understanding of discipleship. As if we could compartmentalize aspects of our lives and calling. The word “discipleship” ought to be a stand-alone term that can carry the full weight of biblical spirituality as defined in Jesus’ version of the shema (Mark 12:28-31). The shema sets the agenda for all aspects of Christian life lived as worship towards God. When Jesus says, "there are no greater commandments than these," we must take Him at His word.</p>
<p>If we really understood the kingdom dynamics and the concentrated theology/worldview that the shema conveys, then we would not have to use the term “missional” at all. Mission is implied in what it means to love God with all that we are and love our neighbor as ourselves. True and authentic worship of the One God requires that I offer my world back to Him in response to His grace and lordship.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, mission is also about offering my world back to God. As a result, discipleship, too, involves me “offering my world back to God”; they (worship, mission, discipleship) are simply dimensionally different aspects of the same phenomenon. We should not have to qualify it with adjectives to somehow make sense of different types of discipleship. To recover discipleship means to recover true worship and mission as well. Much is involved, as we shall soon see.</p>
<p>If many of our deepest problems can be traced from a lack of discipleship—what Dallas Willard called the “non-discipleship of the church”—then is it also equally likely that a recovery of discipleship can signal significant renewal in the life of God’s people? I have come to believe that almost all of the problems of the Church we now face can be linked—at least in part—to the lack of a clear idea and practice of discipleship. This also means that it can, and must, be corrected precisely at this point. We need to get back to basics. Discipleship must take us beyond our need for privatized worship services and an otherworldly spirituality of “quiet times in quiet places” to help transform the many “churchly” admirers of Jesus into true followers of Jesus. Admirers of Jesus are hard to motivate and need to be constantly entertained; only real followers of Jesus will go the distance and make a lasting impact on the world.</p>
