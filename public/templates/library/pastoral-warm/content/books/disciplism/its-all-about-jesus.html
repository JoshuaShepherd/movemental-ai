<h1>Chapter 6: It's All About Jesus. No, Really, It Is.</h1>
<p>Michael Frost and I wrote a book called ReJesus.8 The driving assumption of the book is that we believe most of the Church's ailments and diseases can be traced back to a deficiency in our understanding of, and engagement with, Jesus. But more hopefully therefore, a correction at that point (in what theologians called our Christology) promises us the best chance of renewal in any time and any place.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than in the critical area of discipleship and disciple making.</p>
<p>You just have to read Ephesians and Colossians to get a feel for the mystery of God's amazing purposes in and through Jesus—to sum up all things in Him (Col. 1:15-20).</p>
<p>Jesus, our treasure, almighty God-in-human form, remains the rightful Lord of the Christian. The loss of an awareness and living encounter with God in Jesus inevitably leads to the loss of a sense of the unique calling of the Christian disciple. New Testament Christianity is fundamentally defined by its engagement with God-in-Christ, not just a vague or generic idea of God. Our idea of God is now always seen through the lens of the person and work of Christ. Here is where we go either right or very wrong. Christianity is all about Christ, or it is just a really bad religion. Everything depends on our adherence and connection to Jesus—more than we dare to think.</p>
<p>Because of the centrality of Christ to Christianity, anything that threatens the living relationship or dislodges the centrality of Jesus in His Church must in the end destroy the very fabric of the faith itself. So it's fair to say that many of our most fundamental problems in Church derive from a misconception of who He is and what He represents in the world. In fact, this constitutes the heart of heresy.</p>
<p>And this is exactly why discipleship is so utterly important: Discipleship is basically our lifelong and heartfelt response to my/our Jesus as Lord and Savior. It involves our deepest commitments to allow His life to infuse mine and mine to be drawn up into His—cases in point Paul's "in Christ" union, or John's "abiding with Christ" teachings. I must become more like my Lord, and He must increasingly take up residence in me. In other words, discipleship is about Christ being formed in you and you being formed in Christ. In a real sense, we are being formed after the pattern of Jesus (Rom. 8:28-30, 2 Cor. 3:12-18). His humanity provides us with the human image of what we must become because we must become like Him (1 John 2:5-6). That is what it means to be a mature disciple.</p>
<p>The problem arising for Western Christians, in particular, is that our forms of Christianity have tended to emphasize one aspect of Jesus' ministry and diminish others. Evangelicals particularly have a penchant for the theology of salvation almost exclusively based on the cross. We recognize that God's solution to the human predicament of sin and brokenness was dealt with in Jesus' atoning death on our behalf. But if we were really honest—while we rightfully revel in the salvation He brings—we find His words, His actions, His person and His calling on our lives very disturbing indeed. We fully embrace Jesus as Savior but tend to object to Jesus as Lord and as God's prototypal model of human holiness—the kind of which He expects of us. We build much of our theology around His "works" on our behalf (redemption through the cross), but we tend to diminish His "words" along with the radical lifestyle He lived.</p>
<p>What we have sought to do is to try to domesticate Him, to cut Him down to a more manageable size. But in the process, have we not seriously damaged and domesticated the faith itself? As a result, we have (inadvertently) committed probably the most dangerous heresy of all by divorcing the work of Jesus from the person of Jesus; the religion about Jesus from the religion of Jesus by separating Jesus' salvation from His lordship. Jesus is the Gospel—the whole Gospel of Jesus includes him as Lord and Savior—it's both/and and not an either/or. This divorce between salvation theology (covenant) and kingdom theology (Lordship) strikes a deadly blow at the very theological epicenter of the believer's life and faith. The role, significance and potential impact of Jesus in the life of the Church have seriously diminished our Christianity as a result. Our reductionist gospel and the associated reductionist evangelism need to be broadened out to include Jesus as Savior, as well as Jesus as Lord. His is both at the same time. He is my Redeemer for sure, but He is also my Exemplar, God's image of the perfect human holiness. And we must become like Him. We must reframe evangelism in the context of discipleship because Jesus is Lord and Savior, and that is our proper response. It's not just about pragmatism; this goes to the heart of the message of the Church. When I say that we must fundamentally re-Jesus the church, I'm really saying we must submit ourselves to the gospel from beginning to end. Discipleship is the process of assimilating the gospel, done over a whole lifetime, into the whole of our lives. In a very real sense, we are all still being evangelized (Phil. 1:6, 2 Cor. 3:18, etc.). Evangelism is an aspect of discipleship, and discipleship is an aspect of evangelism—and it's all about Jesus. As we have seen, they are in effect two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer says it so well in his classic book The Cost of Discipleship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipleship means adherence to Christ and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract theology, a forgiveness of sins, render discipleship superfluous, and in fact exclude any idea of following Christ... Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably always Christianity without Christ.9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gospel and life in Christ are all about discipleship and disciple making after all.</p>
<h2>To Bring All Things Together in Christ</h2>
<p>Why all this talk about Christology in a book on discipleship? Well, in the end it really is all about Jesus. And discipleship is the way we show that we take Jesus—His Incarnation, His works, His words, His person, His exemplary life, His commands and His commissions—seriously. Hear this from C. S. Lewis' Mere Christianity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to think that the Church has a lot of different objects—education, building, missions, holding services. The Church exists for no other purpose but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became man for no other purpose. It is even doubtful, you know, whether the whole universe was created for any other purpose. It says in the Bible that the whole universe was made for Christ and that everything is to be gathered together in Him.10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The church that takes discipleship seriously is the church that takes Jesus and the gospel seriously. A church that doesn't take discipleship seriously is a church that doesn't take Jesus seriously. And a church that doesn't take Jesus seriously is not really a church at all. New Testament faith misses the point entirely—and dangerously so.</p>
<p>So the point of this small eBook is simply twofold: 1) To highlight the missional and theological significance of discipleship; and 2) to help you reframe your understanding and practice of evangelism in this light. Much more than what meets the eye is at stake. Our ongoing engagement with the living Jesus in our midst is probably the most important reason why we should make it an inviolable priority in the life of our churches.</p>
<p>Disciple making lies at the core of the Church's mission; it is not an optional extra.</p>
<p>Discipleship is adherence to Jesus and the process by which we are formed in Him.</p>
<p>His life ministry is embedded in and through His people. Discipleship is a lifelong encounter and the privilege of those called to follow Jesus and love God.</p>
<p>In light of these truths, we need to rethink so many of our inherited practices. A good place to start is in reframing our understanding of evangelism in the context of discipleship. It's not the only thing we should do, but it sure is strategic. And, we do it not just because it works for every transformative movement in history, but also because it is right and because we are commanded to: "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the end of the age'" (Matt. 28:18-20 RSV).</p>
