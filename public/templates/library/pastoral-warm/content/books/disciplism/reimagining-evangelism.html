<h2>Chapter 5: Reimagining Evangelism Through Discipleship</h2>
<p>Reimagining evangelism through the lens of discipleship requires that we let go of certain formulaic approaches to evangelism and the rush to get people to pray a certain formulaic prayer. Rather, we need to reconceive discipleship as a process that begins before conversion and continues long after. A person's salvation really is God's business, isn't it? Our part in it is to simply devote ourselves to discipling people on the journey with us—as we go. We don't need to rush to share the standard evangelistic presentation. If we simply follow Jesus and love the people we are investing in, we will get to share the Good News of the kingdom naturally along the way. It is the Holy Spirit who awakens interest in those that He is calling into God's kingdom.</p>
<p>Too conceptual? Then imagine that you know your neighbor Jack at least enough to be chummy with him. Taking this discipleship-oriented approach, at one point you might simply say, “You know Jack, we get on just fine, but I have been thinking. I believe that part of the reason for my life is to make yours a whole lot better. I do have some skills in developing people. How about I invest some time into helping you achieve your greatest dreams?” If Jack says, “Sure, lets give it a go”—and why wouldn’t he? (people like Jack can pay up to a thousand dollars an hour for good life coaching), then we will inevitably start sharing the events, people, stories and dreams that have come together to make Jack what he is today. Eventually, the conversation will get beyond stereotypical male desire for the red Ferrari, the hot babes and the freewheeling lifestyle. Just give it a bit of time. If we are doing our job properly, meaningful material will be shared at a deeper level as Jack begins to communicate his deepest longings, hurts, fears and hopes. All things going well, God will do “His thing” on Jack, and Jack will give his life to Jesus and be saved. But I suggest that we don’t stop discipling at that point. We will continue to help him follow in the Way.</p>
<p>Over time, emphasis might move from more generic forms of mentoring Jack towards more Christ-centered discipleship. The early stages will likely emphasize the evangelistic and invitational aspects of the gospel narrative, but it will do this always within the context of the discipleship journey. And so the process does not change even though the content surely will. Consider this illustration: The wonderful people of Soma Communities based in Tacoma, Wash., have adopted this process as a consistent practice.5 Vision Leader Jeff Vanderstelt rightly emphasizes that the integration of the gospel is a lifelong process. For Soma, in the pre-conversion stage of discipleship, emphasis falls on the evangelism dimension, but is still seen as part of discipleship. Once someone gives her life to Christ, the emphasis shifts from evangelism to discipleship, but in a real sense she is always being evangelized.</p>
<p>Actually reframing evangelism within the context of discipleship squares pretty nicely with what missiologists call the Engels Scale. With this Scale, we can observe definite stages that people undergo in coming to faith and growing in discipleship. It will look something like the following continuum, ranging from -6 to +6</p>
<p>Reframing mission and evangelism around discipleship really does make space for long-term, authentic, loving relationships with people in our lives. This in turn gives credibility to our message and cultivates meaningful friendships—virtues we can all aspire to. What excites me as a movement guy is that if every follower of Jesus simply did this with just two or three people, we would have a making-disciples-making-disciples in a "pay-it-forward"-style movement—we would have the kind of exponential, transformative ministry as Jesus intended it. I know of a megachurch that built a movement—the New Thing Network—on this idea.6 Dave Ferguson and his team at Community Christian Church have built a network of churches relentlessly dedicated to helping people find their way back to God."7 They believe that everyone is on a journey back to God, and that the movement's mission is to help make this happen. So they take discipleship very seriously. They call it "apprenticeship" because it carries within it the idea of learning by doing. They have apprenticing relationships throughout the communities and many church plants, and this is how they multiply and grow as a church. New Thing Network (Community Christian's movement arm)</p>
<p>However, we don’t do it simply because it works, but rather because it’s right for us to do to be authentic. This is what Jesus commissioned us to do. Yes, discipleship always works … it has always worked in the world-changing movements I referenced earlier (the Early Church, Celts, Moravians, Methodism, Chinese underground church, etc.), but we have to be willing to recalibrate our churches around it. It’s not a quick fix, but it is a strategic decision with significant medium to long-term consequences for the future of the Church in the West.</p>
<p>But lest we think of this merely in pragmatic and strategic terms, there is a much deeper reason for the recovery of Jesus-shaped discipleship in the church.</p>
