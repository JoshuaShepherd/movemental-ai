<h2>Frameworks for Missional Christianity</h2>
<p>You are here because you know something. What you know you can’t explain but you feel it. You felt it your entire life. There is something wrong with the world but you don’t know what it is. But it’s there like a splinter in your mind.</p>
<p>—Morpheus to Neo, The Matrix</p>
<p>You can no longer remain unconscious where you slept before; one way or another, you are creating your future.</p>
<p>Wake up before you find that the devils within you have done the creating.</p>
<p>—Stephen L. Talbot, The Future Does Not Compute</p>
<p>In many ways this book is all about connecting ourselves, not with a trendy new movement, but by reconnecting the current Christian church with the power of the original one.</p>
<p>It is one of my deepest held beliefs that all of Jesus' people contain the potential for world transformation in them. Our problem is not that we don't have the potential, but rather that we have forgotten how to access these potentials because we have been so deeply scripted to think of ourselves through more domesticated, non-missional manifestations of Christianity. We have been so programmed out of our callings that it is generally hard for us to think and act differently than what we have for hundreds of years and not to persecute people who try to trailblaze alternative ways. But we have now come (at last!) to the point where we can recognize that the decline of Christianity in the West, and now in America, is directly related to the way we have done things to this point. The search for alternatives has just heated up.</p>
<p>Aslan is on the move again and it’s time to get unplugged, reframed, rescripted, and recommissioned to be the people Jesus designed us to be.</p>
<p>If this was said another way, I would suggest we are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving.</p>
<p>If Christianity is in decline, at least part of the issue goes to the contemporary way we live out faith in a watching world. But this is not what Jesus intended. The church that Jesus designed is made for impact—and massive, highly transformative impact at that. Wasn’t it Jesus who said, “I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it” (Matt. 16:18 NKJV). Hang on! Jesus says that the gates of hell don’t prevail against us! It is we as God’s people who are on the advance here, not hell!</p>
<p>Contrary to many of the images of church as a defensive fortress suffering the terrible, relentless onslaughts of hell, the movement that Jesus set in motion is designed to be an advancing, untamed, and untamable revolutionary force created to transform the world. And make no mistake—there is in Jesus’ words here a real sense of inevitability about the eventual triumph of the gospel. If we are not somehow part of this, then there is something wrong in the prevailing designs and they must change.</p>
<p>Reading this (definitely but necessarily too big) chapter is going to feel like drinking from a fire hydrant, because it summarizes, hopefully in highly accessible ways, ideas that have been formulated and developed in much more detail elsewhere. But this is my “formal briefing,” or conceptual framing, for a missionality that can be lived out right here, right now, by everyone. And this, my friends, takes some reframing... some redesigning of the way we go about being God’s people. The concepts offered here will be made much clearer through the use of story and examples of everyday Christians and churches throughout the rest of thebook. But we have to clarify what we are talking about in the first place, so this thorough briefing should be treated as the point of reference and returned to when necessary.</p>
<h2>Move It</h2>
<p>Let’s start this journey to what we call “missionality” with a big statement that sets the tone for all that will follow: I believe with all my heart that the future of Christianity in the West is somehow bound up with the idea of becoming a people movement again. Somehow and in some way, we need to loosen up and learn how to reactivate the massive potentials that lie rather dormant within Jesus’ people if we are going to make a difference to our world.</p>
<p>It is only when the people of God as a whole are activated in a movement that real world transformation takes place.</p>
<p>And so understanding the nature of people movements is essential. When we look at high-impact movements in the Bible and history, we can see that there are two basic elements of a missional movement that can change the world. If one is missing, then the other will not be able to sustain, let alone reach, exponential impact.</p>
<p>One dimension relates to what I call the apostolic mission (AM), which involves the church or communal side of the movement—the distinctly ecclesial wing. It is critical for the ecclesia (the church) to multiply and cross cultural boundaries for a movement to take place. This is usually spearheaded by people whose primary work is to direct and focus Jesus' people and organize groups, networks, and hubs into apostolic networks that expand exponentially. In other words, people committed to ministry with, and through, the church as an organized community. AM is therefore normally expressed through church planting and organized mission to the poor or cross-culturally. Most of the people reading this book will probably not fit into this category.</p>
<p>The other equally vital (and much harder to galvanize) aspect is what I call the mission of the whole people of God (MPOG), which involves activating the whole people of God and empowering every believer to be active agents of God’s kingdom in every sphere of life. Everyone in this movement, and not just the so-called religious professionals, must be activated and thus play a vital role in extending the mission of Jesus’ church. The people involved in this dimension of people movements are those committed to full-time ministry outside of the church community... but it is still full-time ministry. In fact, this false distinction in what constitutes ministry is one of the major hurdles we have to overcome if we are going to activate as Jesus’ people.</p>
<p>And while most of my writings have focused on the apostolic mission side of the equation, it is absolutely critical that we as the whole people of God are activated. If missional church remains solely in the domain of leaders and clergy, then it is doubtful we will have any lasting missional impact</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apostolic Mission + Mission of the People of God = Transformational Jesus Movement
(e.g., Church Planting) (Agents in Every Sphere)</p>
<p>In the long term, it's going to take both missional church plus missional people.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conversion Is Commission</h2>
<p>You are the church before you do church. If we take Jesus at his word when he says, “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you” (John 20:21), then we realize that our being “sent” (Latin: missio) is the basis of our “doing” church and not the other way around. What is more, this applies to every disciple and not just to the so-called clergy (the called ones). We are all called into the kingdom and into living our life under orders. What we normally infer by the word church limits what the Bible means by it. Church is not simply a building or a formal community meeting, it is who we are—a people who have been formed out of a direct encounter with God in Jesus Christ. If this is true, then general practice in church planting, which simply amounts to “service planting,” actually activates only one side of the movement equation—namely, apostolic mission—but it leaves the MPOG undervalued and almost totally passive and unengaged. This is a fatal error.</p>
<h2>The Worldwide Message Tribe</h2>
<p>We are a unique people formed by the life-changing message of the gospel of Jesus Christ—in effect, a worldwide message tribe. But if we are recipients of a pay-it-forward type message, one that must be passed on, then that makes us all messengers! Every believer is therefore a messenger... and in the terms of this book, a missionary. And Christianity itself is an intrinsically missional faith. Even the newest believer seems to understand the universality of the gospel message; they rightly intuit that because it is “good news,” it is meant to be passed on, and that somehow to sit on the message is to fail in our obligations to Jesus and his cause.</p>
<p>This is how missional movements grow—through a group of people who have been changed by Jesus and are willing to put themselves on the line for his cause. And the cause cannot be limited to evangelism, as if simply telling someone about the saving events of Jesus’ life and death fulfills our missional obligations. Rather it is about living the gospel in such a way that people are drawn into the direct influence (lordship) of Jesus through our lives. It is about living according to a distinct vision of society built on God’s dreams and desires—not ours. In other words, as Rick Warren wryly says, it’s not all about you; rather it is about the kingdom (or rule) of God over all creation. It encompasses everything in human experience—from culture, race, economics, church, entertainment, family, and everything in between. Amissional movement must apply the gospel to all spheres of life (business, family, art, education, science, politics, etc.)—it cannot be limited simply to “coming to church” or participating in building-based programs.</p>
<p>The reality is that it doesn’t take millions of admirers to start a movement that can change the world (in fact, that might be problematic). What is needed is a few people who have been personally transformed and are committed enough to the cause to be willing to in some way or another put their lives in the service of extending it into every domain of life.</p>
<p>It is the personal commitment levels that make all the difference—that’s why Jesus was willing to invest most of his time in “the Twelve” and by extension in “the seventy.” Once he had seeded the essence of his message into his disciples, he could then focus on his upcoming death and resurrection (see Matt. 16:13–21), leaving behind a small band of people who did go on to change the world with it. And this is why being an authentic disciple is so important to his mission.</p>
<p>As I say in The Forgotten Ways, embodiment (the capacity to actually integrate and live out the teachings and message of Jesus) is critical to transmission (the capacity to transfer the message through relationships).1 And in some ways, this is all that is still needed today—real disciples. Jesus will do the necessary transforming; the part we play is to be willing to be used in that process of living the message and getting it out into our worlds. All it needed was people who were willing to be an authentic message tribe.</p>
<p>Seth Godin, pop movements guru, rightly notes that creating a highly dedicated and closely knit tribe usually leads to much more impact than simply trying to make a tribe bigger. “Beyond public relations and awareness related benefits, measuring the breadth of spread of an idea is not as important as looking at the depth of commitment and interaction of true fans, who end up being the people who recruit most new members.”2 In short, what is needed from us is the willingness to move with the Move of God that is the gospel. We suggest that there are a number of movements needed on our behalf if we are indeed going to partake of the movement that Jesus started. We have to be willing to</p>
<ul>
<li>move out (into missional engagement),</li>
<li>move in (burrowing down into the culture),</li>
<li>move alongside (engaging in genuine friendships and relational networks), and</li>
<li>move from (challenging the dehumanizing and sinful aspects of our culture).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Move Out (Mission)</h2>
<p>So the first movement of mission required of us is the willingness to move out—to simply go to the people, wherever that might be. Movement by defintion suggests some form of motion, some type of action: it might not be far, but the obligation is on us to go to them, not them to us.</p>
<h2>The Mission Has a Church</h2>
<p>We have already mentioned that we are people who live under an obligation to extend the mission and meaning of Jesus into our world. The way I framed this in The Forgotten Ways was to say that it is not so much that the church has a mission but that the mission has a church. What this meant is that we really are the result of God’s missionary activity in the world: God sends (missio) his Son into the world. Another way of saying this is that God is the Sending God and the Son is the Sent One. The Father and Son in turn “send” the Spirit into the world (so it turns out that the Spirit is a missionary too). And what is more, Jesus says that as the Father sent him, so he sends and commissions each of us as fully empowered missional agents of the King (John 17:18; 20:21; Matt. 28:19).</p>
<h2>Any Time, Any Place</h2>
<p>Every Christian is a missionary and we are called to live out our commitment to Jesus’ lordship in every sphere and domain of life. Church life, as we normally conceive it, is only one dimension of life and all of us inhabit many other realms that make up our lives. What marks Christianity as distinct is that it is truly a people movement: every believer (and not just some presumed religious elite) is an agent of the kingdom and is called to bring God’s influence into all the realms of human existence. Just look to our New Testament for this!</p>
<p>Because the Holy Spirit lives in us, and we are all bearers of the gospel message, we are all agents of the King right here, right now, and at any time and in any place.</p>
<h2>Build a Bridge and Get Over It</h2>
<p>My wife Deb has this wonderfully humbling thing to say about men and missional church. She says that we men tend to talk and write about it while most women just tend to do it. She follows up with a quick second blow by saying “After all is said and done, it’s all about learning to love other people as Jesus did, isn’t it?” And even though I find this argument exasperating, I really have to agree.</p>
<h2>Learning the Art of the Small</h2>
<ol>
<li>One person can make an impact.</li>
<li>Concentrate your efforts on smaller and smaller areas. When your efforts</li>
</ol>
<p>are diffused over a wide area, they won’t have much of an impact. So focus on smaller areas, and your efforts will be felt more fully. It could take time for change to happen, but keep that focus narrow.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Try to find an area that will cause a tipping point. You’ll have the biggest impact if you can change something that will in itself cause further changes— the rock that causes the avalanche. This isn’t an easy thing, to find that pressure point, that spot that will cause everything else to change. It takes practice and experience and luck and persistence, but it can be found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t try to beat an ocean. You’ll lose. Instead, focus on small changes that</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>will spread.3 For most of us, what will be required to engage in missional Christianity is to simply reach out beyond our fears and ignorance of others, to overcome our middle-class penchant for safety, to take a risk and get involved in what God is already doing in our cities and neighborhoods. It’s not a science really, although as we will see, there are sometimes tricky cultural elements to deal with. It is all about love. Just read 1 John again to remind yourself of this.</p>
<h2>Use What’s in Your Hand</h2>
<p>One of the most significant things to remember in getting missional is often the thing we most overlook. It’s not all about starting grand programs and running big organizations. It is just doing what you do... for God. The basic elements of missionality are already present in your life. It might develop into an organization (e. g., Tom’s Shoes, Laundry Love),4 but it probably should not start there. In this book we will explore many ways we can simply use the basic constituents of life and make them an act of worship to God and service to his world.</p>
<p>Sometimes simple gestures make all the difference. Don't be overwhelmed. Certainly, prepare yourself in prayer and study of the gospel and culture, but trust that God will use you as you are—he has always done so. You don’t need a degree to be a very effective agent of the King. Asaint is merely a person who makes it easier for others to believe in God. Mother Teresa (of all people!) once famously quipped, “I don’t do big things. I do small things with big love.” We are not required to do a great thing in life, but many, many small things, each done with love.</p>
<h2>Move In (Incarnation)</h2>
<p>So we are called to be a missional (move out) people, and if we are willing to follow the missional Spirit, I venture to bet that we will end up in some rather unusual situations and places.</p>
<p>And we don’t mean just cross-cultural here: it might simply mean reaching over your fence, and beyond that into the local neighborhood. But don’t be surprised if this is still a bit of a challenge to you. One of the things that has happened over the last decade or so is a massive cultural shift away from the Judeo-Christian heritage into a truly subcultural, multicultural experience... our neighborhoods have gone and changed on us.</p>
<p>To move deep into the culture is to take the idea of incarnational mission seriously. This in turn takes its cue from the fact that God took on human form and moved into our neighborhood, assumed the full reality of our humanity, identified with us, and spoke to us from within a common experience.</p>
<p>Following his example, and in his cause, we take the same type of approach when it comes to mission.</p>
<h2>Going Tribal</h2>
<p>Whether we like it or not, we live in a world that is culturally fragmented and fragmenting. The result of cultural disintegration is that people now choose to identify with various subcultural groups. Any modern city is now made up of literally thousands of different subcultures: from sports groups, hobby clubs, interest groups, to groups that gather around sexual preference (the gay community is always a big one in major cities throughout the West), to pubs, clubs, music groups, surfers, skaters... you name it!</p>
<p>Moving deep means that we choose to connect with, identify with, and belong to one or a few of these urban tribes.</p>
<p>Don’t try identifying with everyone within your reach— if this does not drive you mad, it certainly will exhaust you. Rather focus your efforts on meaningful connections with certain people and people groups. Go where they go, hang out where they hang out, do what they do. I have seen churches develop this in the strangest of normal places: along riverbanks with the waterskiing community, rave clubs, amateur drama theatres, online game communities.</p>
<p>I know of one young mom who, instead of attending the local church’s MOPS program, chose to adopt one of the many local non-Christian mothers groups. She was soon asked to lead it and her influence as a Christian was significantly magnified, more than if she had simply attended the local Christian version.</p>
<h2>St. Paul Goes to the Movies</h2>
<p>Afew years ago I ran and organized a conference called St. Paul Goes to the Movies. The idea was to help Christians lean how to share faith from within diverse cultural settings in Western contexts. My advice to all Christians is, in order to take missionality seriously, you have to take culture seriously.</p>
<p>There is no dodging this aspect. You simply have to assume that, in Western contexts, all communication of the gospel, let alone church planting and mission, is now cross-cultural.</p>
<p>Don’t presume you really know what’s going on. The reality is that most Christians don’t really know what goes on in the lives of non-Christian people. Research indicates that the majority of Christians have no significant relationships with people beyond their church community. To move out (get missional), and to move in (get incarnational), this must change.</p>
<p>Right Here</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you find yourself called to a certain urban tribe, whoever
they might be, then it is critical that you take their culture—in
effect, their meaning system—seriously. Go to movies with
likely to read (there is good demographical information about
shops and magazine racks as to what people are talking about
sure you see it and try to work out what it is they seemed to
relates to the issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The missional Christian makes the connections between people’s existential issues and the gospel, as we shall see, but it does take some cultural savvy to make this happen well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redeeming Your Hangout (Third Places, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Missionality right here, right now does not always require you to go to places and people you find so different and uncomfortable. In the principle of starting with what’s already in your hand, make a list of the things you love to do. Odds are there are a whole lot of people who already do one of those things together, and if not, then there are probably people who would like to do that with others. Another approach is to list the vibrant social spaces in your area and simply adopt one and become a regular. Don’t do this as some sort of lone missional ranger. How about a few of you take this on as a common mission.</p>
<p>Some popular interests include art forms, murals, beer brewing, cooking, cycling. A look at your local newspaper will reveal hundreds of such groups around. For example, I know of a group of believers who simply loved bush walking— trekking through the mountains and hills around Melbourne.</p>
<p>Problem was, the only free day they had was Sunday, so they decided to make that their church. They would trek out into the bush, taking in the glories of God's creation and good comradeship along the way. At a certain point they would stop, have a meal and communion together, share around Scripture, take an offering, pray for people, and then continue bush walking for the rest of the day. About 40 percent of the group were non-Christians deeply interested in the mix of nature and spirituality that The Earth Club provided.</p>
<p>The church that Jesus built doesn’t need all the institutional paraphernalia that we have been scripted to think it does.</p>
<p>You carry it with you everywhere you go.</p>
<p>Speaking the Lingo (All Mission Is Cross-Cultural) All missionaries must deal with language. To speak the lingo means to understand and adopt the language forms of the people we love and serve. We do so in order to represent Jesus meaningfully in the group itself. Tim Keller, one of the elder statesmen of the missional church world, encourages us to enter and retell the culture’s stories with the gospel rather than the other way around.5 For instance, in church circles there is a certain insider language—a common worldview that allows us to simply exhort Christianized people with little or no real engagement, listening, or persuasion. In a missional setting, communication should always assume the presence of skeptical people and should engage their stories, not simply talk the church’s insider story and language. This requires that we are sensitive to story and language and how these inform identity and community.</p>
<p>The older culture’s story was to be a good person, a good father/mother, son/daughter, to live a decent, merciful, good life. Now the culture’s story is—(a) to be free and self-created and authentic (theme of freedom from oppression), and (b) to make the world safe for everyone else to be the same (theme of inclusion of the “other”; justice). To “re-tell” means to show how only in Christ can we have freedom without slavery and embracing of the “other” without injustice.6 To listen to the culture’s stories, we need to be attentive.</p>
<p>Once again movies and art form will give us a good clue, because great art is a way in which people seek to express meaning. For instance, in what way do the movies Revolutionary Road, The Matrix, or The Pursuit of Happyness tell us about our culture’s story and values? Test this; try asking people what their absolutely favorite movie is, and why this is so, and you will hear a lot about that person.</p>
<p>This is a great way to try to understand and unlock people’s culture code.</p>
<p>Watch Paul the missionary in Athens: he is very sensitive to their religion, poetry, and philosophy (Acts 17). In this context Paul exegetes the culture, allowing the biblical story to inform and guide him—but he starts with the culture and ends with the gospel. In Jerusalem it’s a different story; he whips out his big black King James (or equivalent) and he begins with Scripture and proceeds to culture. The more and more America slips into the encroaching post-Christian experience, the more and more we are going to have to take an Athenian approach to engaging it. In a missional context, Christians must learn to behave like culturally tuned missionaries.</p>
<h2>Wired for God</h2>
<p>One of the most basic assumptions of the incarnational missionary is to assume God is already involved in every person’s life and is calling them to himself through his Son.</p>
<p>Our mindset should not be the prevalent one of taking God with us wherever we might go. It must be, instead, that we join God in his mission.</p>
<p>This means that the missionary God has been active a long time in a person’s life. Our primary job is to try to see where and how God has been working and to partner with him in bringing people to redemption in Jesus. Understanding that all humans are made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27), and in the deepest possible way made for God, we can assume that every human is motivated by spirituality and search for meaning. Even idolatry indicates that people are seeking to worship something beyond themselves.</p>
<p>It is deformed spirituality to be sure, but it is spirituality nonetheless—and you can work with that. Recognize that behind many of the things not-yet-Christian people do lies a search for something else. C. S. Lewis once noted that all our vices are virtues gone wrong. If we take this as a clue, we can develop new missionary eyes to see what God is up to in people’s lives.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at this: consider Las Vegas, the consummate sinner’s town. And it is that—a deeply broken place where people get really messed up. But we can put aside our moral misgivings and choose to look at the gambling dens with more missional eyes. We might ask, what is the person who is sitting at the slot machines really searching for? Perhaps it is the search for redemption but in the wrong place.</p>
<p>It is the belief that to win the jackpot means to be changed and transformed into a new life. This search might also be driven by a now pathological need to take risks because life has lost its sense of real adventure.</p>
<p>We can literally work our way through any type of event or activity in this way:</p>
<p><strong>Gambling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is really being sought: Redemption by luck/money, need for risk, overcoming unhappiness</li>
<li>How the gospel addresses this: Finding meaning in doing things, hope, call to live adventurously and risk lovingly as a disciple</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sports events</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is really being sought: A cause to belong to, transcendent experiences, community with team/fans</li>
<li>How the gospel addresses this: A real cause that aims at changing the world, real transcendent experience, authentic community</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pubs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is really being sought: Community, a partner community, overcoming loneliness, fun/chill time</li>
<li>How the gospel addresses this: Real but loving community, highs without drugs, nonexploitative relationships, lasting joy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drug-taking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is really being sought: Ecstatic experiences, escaping from life, overcoming guilt and pain</li>
<li>How the gospel addresses this: Encountering God, meaning and purpose, forgiveness and healing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is really being sought: Hearing the stories and myths that shape life, suspension of disbelief, entertainment/escape, "feeling" again (laughing, crying, etc.)</li>
<li>How the gospel addresses this: Connection with the Story that makes sense of our stories, reality not fantasy, passion leading to compassion</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We can trust that because of the way God has designed us, in the end human beings are always searching (albeit in false and idolatrous ways) for real meaning, authentic relationships, and genuine community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more dimension of this that must be mentioned is that all people have religious experiences. It is false to say that only Christians can experience God. Anyone looking at a sunset can experience an in-breaking of God-awareness.</p>
<p>In The Color Purple, Celia recalls a time as a child walking with her mother past a field of violets when she felt that God was making a pass at her in the flowers. God is constantly “making a pass” at us in everyday experiences—we simply need to become much more aware of him. People call these experiences theophanies (God encounters), and our task as God’s sent people is to bring a meaningful interpretation to these experiences and point people to Jesus as the center of the God experience. This is what Keller means by telling people’s stories in the light of God’s story—the gospel.</p>
<h2>Priests in the Hood (Making Connections between God and People)</h2>
<p>Another way to look at this role of seeing “the virtue in the vice” is to conceive of ourselves in terms of one of our deepest identities as disciples, namely, the priesthood of all believers. In Untamed, Deb and I suggest that unlocking this is one of the most potent things we can do to allow God to work through all of his people. A priest is essentially someone who mediates the knowledge of God. Our priestly role therefore is to introduce people to Jesus and Jesus to people, and as far as we can, make sure that it is a right understanding of Jesus that we are mediating, and then step out of the way—let Jesus do his thing with people. He knows exactly how to deal with them.</p>
<h2>What Is Good News for This People?</h2>
<p>As we have seen, a missionary is essentially a messenger obligated to somehow deliver the message in a way it can be received. This means that we have to be able to speak meaningfully into a culture, but in order to do that, we have to seriously examine a given culture for clues to what God is doing among a people. One of the best ways to start this "listening process" is to go to your tribe. And standing where they stand, and having explored the dynamics of their search, simply ask yourself this question: "What is good news for this people?" What is going to make them throw a party and invite their friends? This is exactly what Matthew did (Matt. 9:9–13). This will mean trying to delve into the existential issues a people or cultural group deals with. It means searching for signs of the quest for meaning and therefore for God.</p>
<p>Just like Paul in Athens (Acts 17), it will also mean a study of the religion, art, and literature of the group.</p>
<h2>Volunteering, according to Mark Van Steenwyk</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most urban areas have social service organizations in place. I suggest you volunteer with them instead of starting church programs—at least early on in the life of your church. In the West part of our city, there are over a dozen organizations that will take volunteers. When we started, we tried to do our own English as a Second Language program. It didn't work like we wanted.</p>
<p>I'm realizing now that it would have been better to put our energy towards volunteering at existing ESL courses. When we volunteer, we submit to the service organizations—yielding to their agenda instead of forcing our own.</p>
<p>In that place, we can begin to make relationships with people. As we meet people and get to know them, we have the opportunity to take that friendship outside of the volunteer organization. As we find out more of their needs, then we may try to serve them as a church.</p>
<p>The basic idea is this: utilize existing structures. Build relationships within the existing systems. Social services provide a great way for you to meet people (both volunteers and those with needs) without having to put a lot of time and energy into planning. You get the benefit of meeting people by simply volunteering. And you will grow in your understanding of the people you want to serve. Plus, you are helping people. And too many churches don't do enough of that.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn't mean that a church should never start programs. A church may be obligated to do so because there is a profoundly unmet need. Or you may be led to do so; these are simply suggestions to help you think through being incarnational, not hard-and-fast rules.7</p>

<h2>Follow the Ant Trails</h2>
<p>Once we have named the existential issues that our adopted tribe faces, our task will then turn to developing communities (because that's what good mission aims at—a community of Jesus disciples). In the debriefing at the end of the book, we will look at how we might reframe our understanding of church. At this point it might simply mean asking the question, What is church going to look like for this particular tribe of people? To answer this will require that you look at the social patterning of the group. Follow the ant trails and they will lead you to the "nest." Where do they meet? Why do they meet? What is the cultural dynamic of the group? And once you have done this, try to articulate what an authentic expression of church might look like within that cultural setting. If it’s a tribe that meets regularly at the local pub, then it’s pretty easy. If it’s a group of mountain bikers, it might be a bit more difficult, but you can be sure they meet somewhere. The aim will be to incarnate the gospel in the place by first planting the gospel (Jesus) and then allowing a local and indigenous expression of community to grow out of that encounter.</p>
<h2>Experiencing Seamlessness</h2>
<p>One of the important dimensions of incarnational mission is to somehow break the dualistic impasse that seems to exist between various aspects of our worlds. We experience God, church, and the rest of life as being in separate, nonintersecting compartments. We live as if there is an insurmountable distance between the "sacred" and the "secular." But if Jesus is Lord of all of life, there is no such distinction.</p>
<p>The bad scripting downloads through the way we do church: the language and experience of church is generally worlds away from our experience of work, play, politics, etc. In fact they all seem to be so disparate and exist on their own autonomous principles. The world of commerce, for instance, seems to run on its own principles (e.g., radical competition), ones that you would never apply to your personal relationships and family (which requires a fundamental cooperation), or vice versa. Living under the lordship of Jesus requires that we bring all elements into relation with him—we cannot exclude dimensions from God's concern or we create dark zones that invite the idols to enslave us. The way I illustrate this in The Forgotten Ways is as follows:8</p>
<p><strong>The Dualistic Christendom Mode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Private sphere (sacred activities: worship, prayer, etc.)</li>
<li>Public sphere (secular activities: work, play, family, politics, etc.)</li>
<li>God → Church → World (the mediating institution)</li>
<li>Sacred realm vs. secular realm</li>
</ul>
<p>Here our "worlds" never seem to meet but rather are experienced as pulling in opposite directions. We divide our worlds into the sacred (on the left) and the secular (on the right), and they are experienced as worlds apart. Incarnational approaches try to see the kingdom in all elements of life and seek to bring the dimensions closer. We take the church with us into the world, because in the deepest possible way, we are the church.</p>
<p><strong>Nondualistic Spirituality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unifying our lives under the one God</li>
<li>Sanctifying the everyday</li>
<li>God's presence in all things</li>
<li>Common grace</li>
<li>God in strange places</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving deeper therefore means bringing the disparate elements of life together in a way that creates a more seamless experience of the Christian life. We allow our various worlds to collide. We try to be the same person in at least three places—church, home, and work—but an integrated, incarnational spirituality also means that the gospel seeps into the nooks and crannies of our lives.</p>
<p>So to sum up, we first move out and then move in. Or as incarnational missionary Mark Van Steenwyk wisely advises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you move into the area (or if you already live in the area), spend time just observing. Don't get frenetic. Don't start doing things until you understand the ethos of the neighborhood. Let the spirit of the place make its impression. Fall in love with the little things. Get to know the people. If you start "doing your thing" before you are familiar with the place, then you're forcing things too much. Ministry should fit with how God is already working in a place. If you start pushing your agenda before you start making friends with the neighbors and finding out about their lives, then you're a salesman, not a minister of reconciliation. And throughout it all, pray. Pray for spiritual eyesight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the Spirit’s job to reveal Christ... not just to “them” but also to “you.” Pray that you can see Christ’s fingerprints in your neighborhood. Pray to see the face of Christ in the face of those who live around you. Pray for the Spirit to show you what is wrong in your area, and also what is right. Seek to understand.9</p>
<h2>Move Alongside (Urbs and Relationships)</h2>
<h3>SUBurb: A Theology of Geography/Place</h3>
<p>The reality is, to become a missional Christian, we begin by simply paying attention to the neighborhood and the relationships in various aspects of our life. But if the tribe you are seeking to touch with the love of Jesus lives in another part of town (or in the case of a missionary, overseas), you will need to seriously consider relocating. It is interesting that our Lord is called Jesus of Nazareth. So it’s clear that Jesus got into Nazareth, but I have often found myself wondering how much of Nazareth got into Jesus.</p>
<p>The truth is that in the incarnation, Jesus took up residence in Nazareth, in ancient Judea, among a distinct people, and became one of them.</p>
<p>We used the idea of being the priest in the hood above.</p>
<p>Well, just like a local gang, we should have a “turf.” When seeking to touch a people, an urban tribe, it is no good simply visiting their area and then traveling over half an hour to get home. You should live where you want to serve.</p>
<p>You should be able to bump into the tribe in the local shops and supermarket. This allows for what I call three practices of incarnational engagement: proximity, frequency, and spontaneity.10</p>
<h3>Ground Control to Major Tom: Making Contact</h3>
<p>In Western settings, we should simply assume that all communication of the gospel is cross-cultural. If you do this, at least you won't make the mistake of assuming the same worldview and beliefs as the people you are trying to reach.</p>
<p>Train yourself to be inclusive and invitational in posture.</p>
<p>And while the missional posture requires a go-to-them approach, it will also be an invitation to relationship. So find ways to invite people into your life: to a BBQ, to a party, or whatever. And remember to talk as if nonbelieving people are present—learn to drop the insider/church lingo. Tim Keller says that if you speak and converse as if your whole neighborhood is present (not just scattered Christians), eventually more and more of your neighborhood will find their way into your life and community and feel a part of it.11</p>
<h2>Beyond Functional Friendships</h2>
<p>In Untamed12 Deb and I suggest that for the large part, we have generally misinterpreted the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18–20) as an evangelistic text, whereas in fact it is a discipling text. It is not about simply sharing the Good News with people through abstract concepts about Jesus and calling for a response—this is at best only part of the deal, at worst a shoddy witness and mere salesmanship. Friendships should be part of the equation. We are called to disciple the nations, which means we are committed to a long-term relationship with them that must surely include meaningful friendships, genuine involvement, and compassionate concern for a person’s best good. Christians should know how to be the best friends a person can have, because friendship (in the truest sense of discipleship) lies at the heart of the biblical commission. Think of the Great Commission in this way: as pre-conversion discipleship AND post-conversion discipleship, but it is discipleship all along the way.</p>
<h2>The Art of Conversation(s)</h2>
<p>In many ways this recipe is part cultural savvy, part organic friendship, and part hospitality, but in our experience Christians are not necessarily good at conversation. We tend toward functionality in our relationships, we lack cultural breadth, and we are too quick to want to get to the Bible and spirituality. In short, we should strive to be more culturally interesting. For men, sports features quite strongly in conversation, and for women, family and relational issues.</p>
<p>Whatever the content, genuinely artful conversation uses all of these in a dialogue that is authentically conversational—subtle, spiritual, and culturally tuned to the issues of the day—to really engage people at the level of their lives and story. Remember, pop culture is where people live! Be aware of what's going on at that level. And stop being overly "spiritual," using insider, religious language, to talk about God—it mostly alienates people. Rather, bring a God interpretation to ordinary life without forcing conversations to the four spiritual laws.</p>
<p>Conversation invites friendship, provokes intrigue, promotes mutual quest, weaves story with opinion, extends a listening ear, and offers something of the self in the equation. At best it is done around tables or in places of social engagement. And make no mistake; it is a powerful way of missionally engaging people. In Untamed we suggest that if every Christian family in the world simply offered good conversational hospitality around a table once a week to neighbors, we would eat our way into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2>Sneezing the Gospel</h2>
<p>In The Forgotten Ways I suggest that all good ideas spread like viruses and that the gospel, insofar that it is an idea (of course it is more than that), is no exception. In other words, we “sneeze” the gospel into various social settings as we let it travel along relational lines.13 This phenomenon of viral movements is demonstrated in the power of social networking so prevalent in our day. To be missional disciples, we need to learn how to use the power of ideas and relationships and bring these together. To do this we need rich relationships, or in terms of people movements, lots of “social surface” to be big influencers in people’s lives. The greater the social surface, the higher the likelihood of influence/spread, and therefore missional impact. It is important to remember this because the gospel always travels along and within the relational fabric of a given culture.14 Missional Christianity needs to get relationally savvy, and it should come naturally because we are called to love and discipleship.15</p>
<h2>Matthew’s Party</h2>
<p>In Luke 10 Jesus sends the seventy out with some very sage missional advice. Among other things he tells them not to start groups in their own houses but to "go" to people's houses and start things up there. The reason? Well, it is their turf, and because of that they are most likely to invite their friends to a social gathering that they host. If it was at your place, they might come but are unlikely to invite their friends.</p>
<p>The principle here is that we should be aware of social dynamics and the role of gatekeepers. It’s part of relational savvy-ness mentioned above. Missionaries have long understood that identifying the person who holds “the keys” to entry to the tribe plays a strategic role in reaching that tribe.</p>
<p>Without being manipulative about it, we would be wise to focus on such people. If they open up to us (and God), then they in turn will win their own social circle over.</p>
<p>Matthew the tax collector is a case in point (Matt. 9:9–13).</p>
<p>Mathew becomes a disciple and holds a party where he invites all his friends. Zacchaeus does the same thing (Luke 19:2–10).</p>
<p>They don’t have to go to church or to a house church to meet Jesus. He comes to them. And this is not equivalent to using people, because we choose to love them authentically in their own world; it just means being strategic with our time and influence.</p>
<p>So to develop missionality right here, right now, we move out, move in, move alongside, and as we shall now see, sometimes move from.</p>
<h2>Move From (Subvert)</h2>
<p>Contrary to a narrow fundamentalist understanding of things, the gospel does not challenge or undermine everything in any given culture. There are many good things that are entirely consistent with a biblical understanding of society and life.</p>
<p>For example, non-Christians who value speaking the truth, doing good to others, and living outwardly moral lives. Theologians have always called this common grace. These include aspects of culture that can be affirmed and deepened by coming into contact with the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, there will be things in any culture (including our own) that jar up against what Jesus teaches—aspects that are ungodly and dehumanizing. It is the missional Christian’s duty to be very discerning here, because failure to recognize the deficiencies in our own culture means that we will simply impose our culture (and sometimes not the gospel) on a people group or tribe. But when it comes to being missional right here and right now, sometimes we are simply going to have to issue a direct challenge, or in the language of this heading “move from,” in order to bring Good News into the tribe.</p>
<h2>Questioning and the Quest</h2>
<p>The truth is that we don’t always have to take issues headon. Sometimes our role is to be undercover subversives. Yes, there are times when we need to be overt and verbal and confrontational, but perhaps not all that often. There is another deeply biblical way of going about bringing profound change in a society. Jesus talked about the kingdom of God as being like yeast that leavens a whole lump without our direct influence. He talked about it being like a field where the farmer plants and waters, and it grows all by itself. In other words, the kingdom works covertly to undermine the way things are now and to initiate God’s rule in its place.</p>
<p>Scholars call this aspect of Jesus’ teaching of the kingdom “the now and the not-yet.” Some people see it and respond.</p>
<p>Others cannot see it at all. One day God will concentrate it all to a point and close the deal once and for all. But we can be sure the kingdom is here right now... active in the entire world, but especially through his people.</p>
<p>Many times in pastoral work, when we have brought someone to the Lord who was sleeping with his/her partner, we didn't throw the rulebook at them. Rather, we would introduce them to Jesus and trust that the couple would come to the right conclusions themselves. We would plant good seeds, water them, and voilà, the Holy Spirit would do his work.</p>
<p>The parables are classical tools of subversion. In The Shaping of Things to Come, Michael and I probe why Jesus never seems to answer a question directly.16 Sometimes he answers with a counterquestion. But most often he uses parables. Now a parable is not some cute little illustration to make things clear.</p>
<p>In fact, Jesus says that they are quite the opposite—they are puzzles that can really confuse the hearers (Matt. 13:1–23). They are not clear-cut, three-point sermons with good illustrations to boot. They are designed to provoke a search—a quest—in which the hearer is invited to fill in the blanks for themselves.</p>
<p>And clearly they are subversive, because some get it and some miss the point. Some like what they hear and others hate it.</p>
<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
<p>The most consistent way to challenge the destructive forces in popular culture is to live contrary to them—to actually be the change we want to see. In a world obsessed with consumerism, we choose to live more simply. In a world obsessed with social status and image, we choose to associate with poor, “invisible,” and uncool people and invite them into our lives. In a world obsessed with money, we choose to be very generous. In other words, without withdrawing ourselves from our tribe, we have to model what a Jesus alternative looks like to our tribe. They must see the gospel embodied in us, for in the end, the medium is the message.17 In relation to lifestyle, Tim Keller suggests that in a missional church,... Christian community must go beyond that to embody a “counter-culture,” showing the world how radically different a Christian society is with regard to sex, money, and power....</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>In money.</strong> We promote a radically generous commitment of time, money, relationships, and living space to social justice and the needs of the poor, the immigrant, the economically and physically weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In power.</strong> We are committed to power sharing and relationship-building between genders, races, and classes that are alienated outside of the Body of Christ.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, a church must be more deeply and practically committed to deeds of compassion and social justice than traditional liberal churches and more deeply and practically committed to evangelism and conversion than traditional fundamentalist churches. This kind of church is profoundly “counter-intuitive” to American observers. It breaks their ability to categorize (and dismiss) it as liberal or conservative. Only this kind of church has any chance in the nonChristian West.18</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>One of the most profound ways to embody countercultural dissents against the evil propensities in our cultures is to embody the gospel in a community of Jesus’ people. It has been said that the real task of Christians is to be the church rather than to transform the world. In other words, the church doesn’t have a social strategy, the church is the social strategy. Here we get to show the world a certain type of life the world can never achieve through social coercion or governmental action.</p>
<p>When the church gets its act together, it is the most potent force for the transformation of the world.19 When we try putting into effect a Christian political agenda/party, we inevitably mess it up—if the European Christendom experience taught us anything, it taught us this. Most Christian political parties end up being domineering, angry, religious bullies operating through coercive power—hardly consistent with Jesus’ approach to changing the world. In fact, we end up looking more like Jesus’ opponents—the scribes, Sadducees, Zealots, and Pharisees.</p>
<p>This communal aspect is also why missionality is not the work of a lone ranger that is so much part of the American individualistic mythology. The kind of change God requires of the world can only be achieved through communal action.</p>
<p>It’s the trick that God has played on our individualism. We can do truly great things only when we find each other and do it together. This is the realm of missional church, and we are all part of it. Besides, a community that embodies the life and teachings of Jesus is the kind of community that is itself deeply attractive to a lonely and lost world. The best thing we can do is simply become ourselves and live it out as authentically as we can.</p>
<h2>Sexuality</h2>
<p>We live in a world obsessed by sex. Clearly this presents a challenge to our view of the world. Quite honestly I am not sure that historically we have done a good job of representing God on this one. We have largely been experienced as life-suppressing moralists and/or dangerous bigots. The reality is that our Lord Jesus actually dealt very mercifully with “sexual sinners” (e. g., Luke 7:36–50; John 8:1–11) and extremely harshly with self-righteous moralists (e. g., Matt. 23). The church should become more like Jesus on this one.</p>
<p>Speaking from within his experience of New York's urban context, Tim Keller suggests that we should avoid both the secular society's idolization of sex and traditional society's fear of sex. "We must also exhibit love rather than hostility or fear toward those whose sexual life-patterns are different."20 Too right! The issue is that we must demonstrate an alternative vision of sexuality, but we must do so without being moralistic. People are watching us on this.</p>
<p>OK, enough. Well, at least enough to make a good start of being a darn good missional disciple in any context we might find ourselves in. We have explored four aspects of what it means to be a movement: move out, move in, move alongside, move from.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all this is well within your power and means. Jesus designed you for influence, change, and impact, right here, right now. And in your healing and salvation lies the healing and salvation of others around you and through you. You simply have to live it in ways that are meaningful and accessible to all. Our lives, for his glory, and for his kingdom—this is our true worship.</p>
