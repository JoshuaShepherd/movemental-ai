<h2>Debriefing: Right Now</h2>
<h2>Recovering Missional Moxie</h2>
<p>That which you wish to change, you must first love.</p>
<p>—Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</p>
<p>—Jesus (Matt. 16:18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now the reader will have gotten the impression that I play a somewhat geeky role, and that I often sound somewhat theoretical. But I believe that we need a more theoretical framework for missional living right here, right now, because our largely unreflective approaches to church, mission, and discipleship are simply not going to cut it in the twenty-first century. These ideas need to be prayerfully considered and wrestled with if we are going to negotiate the complexities of this century. The way we think of things matters—for good or for ill, ideas have consequences. I always remind myself of Einstein's dictum that the problems of the world cannot be resolved by the same kind of thinking that created them. We need the wrestling and the reframing, and to do that we need to have to repent of our ways—but that's a good thing.</p>
<p>I believe so deeply in the power of God’s good news people that I have committed my life to somehow awakening this now sleeping giant. If we, the people of God, can “find ourselves” again, right here, right now, in this time and place, then the most profound of revolutions is on! And right now, we have a good chance of it, but for Western Christianity at least, it might well be our last chance to get it right—witness the now almost complete demise of biblical Christianity in Western Europe!</p>
<p>I will go further and say that the battle for the future of Christianity in the West will be worked out in America—and I say this as a non-American, an Aussie with South African roots and a deep Jewish heritage. If we fail right here, right now, in America, then I really fear the eventual passing of a vibrant biblical Christianity in Western contexts. And so, I have left kith and kin and come to America to help awaken the sleeping giant of God’s people. I am, at core, an activist and not a theoretician! I am a stakeholder who has played all his cards on this time and this place, on the belief that it is a strategic time, a time when our choices are really going to matter.</p>
<p>To awaken the people of God to their dormant potentials, we have to shake off certain ways of imagining ourselves that hinder and therefore bind us from being the people we were designed to be. Truth is, we have all drunk so deeply from institutional wells of thinking about Christianity that it is hard to think of ourselves differently. We have, to co-opt Marx’s words, taken a big dose of what he called “the opiate of the people”—religion (in the really bad sense of the word). Marx saw religion as the cultural force that kept people docile and Recovering Missional Moxie submissive to the prevailing order of reality, and to be honest, in this at least, I think he was right. Use your imaginations here: morphine or heroin is an opiate (opium-based drug).</p>
<p>Ever seen a person taking a hit of heroin? I have, and they effectively go into a deep, trancelike sleep. Religion does that to us... it dulls us and puts us to sleep. We become ineffective.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Way of Jesus was never the way of “religion.” In fact, Jesus reserves his harshest possible condemnations for the very “religious” people of his day and condemned religion for what it does to people—just read Matthew 23 for a taster. Far from being a toxic hit of heroin, Jesus was a sobering splash of bracing, icy water! He awoke people to God, kingdom, their own potentials, and he started a movement that swept out from backwater Judea to utterly transform the world of its day. Everyone who was touched and transformed by Jesus was able to, in turn, participate in the transformation of others around about them. The Jesus movement that emerged from the dusty boondocks of the Roman Empire has swelled through history to transform billions of lives, and it still does, as millions are added every year.</p>
<p>This is the power of people movement, and this is the church that Jesus designed to change the world—a thoroughgoing people movement that had little of what we normally conceive of as what constitutes a “church”—buildings, clergy, bookstores, seeker-sensitive services, priest-run liturgies, complex theological formulas, or whatever. In fact, this very question provided the initiating impulse of my book The Forgotten Ways, which was to answer how they did this. My attempt at an answer to this question has guided the writing of Right Here, Right Now. It constitutes some of that reframing that is needed to reinvent ourselves in our time.</p>
<p>But my role is not quite finished. I started with the briefing—an attempt to give some positive framework of how the everyday Christian might engage in Jesus’ mission more effectively (I don’t even use the terms “clergy/laity” because I believe that lies at the root of many of our problems). And Right Now then my slightly zany buddy Lance offered his somewhat folksy all-American twist to what it means to activate your own missional moxie. His story should provide some cultural references that connect with the story of most of our intended readers. In this final chapter, I will do what we can call the debriefing. There are some things that just need to be said.</p>
<p>So this chapter will involve naming some of the things that I believe must be dealt with if we are going to do the particular tasks God has for us to do at the dawn of the twenty-first century (Eph. 2:10). These are some of the proverbial elephants in the room: the big issues we must face but most people simply dodge because they are considered too hard to deal with.</p>
<p>To chase the elephants from the room, I am going to have to use a stick at the very least. So here you have Hirschy with a stick in his hand. Not me at my nicest, but to heal a system that you deeply love, you sometimes have got to get over being “nice.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s Nothing like a Good Stretch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you will have noticed by now, this book stretches the meaning of what we normally mean by “church.” We make no apology for this: there is no doubt that over time, our idea of the church has shrunk to unbiblical proportions—so we need some stretching, as ridiculous as that sounds. Our best thinkers have long recognized that the gospel has been effectively marginalized and Christianity relegated to the realm of private, individualized, religious opinion with little impact on the broader world of politics, science, economics, art, and culture.1 If ever there was a time to reimagine the church and its mission, it is now.</p>
<p>We certainly need to think of the church more as an exponential people movement involving all of God’s people and not an institution run by religious professionals offering different brands of religious goods and services. But to Recovering Missional Moxie stretch our ecclesiology will require that we have to somehow get a handle on the basics of what makes a church, well... a church. This is because in reinventing the church for the particular challenges of our era, we run the risk of ending up being less of what the Bible means by “church” than before.</p>
<p>So we must go back to Scripture to rediscover what theologians have called the “marks” or “identifiers” of the church that Jesus built and start again from there.</p>
<p>In saying this, I am not suggesting it’s all bad. But I do think that the traditional marks of the church that stemmed from the Reformation are woefully inadequate to equip the contemporary Western church to deal with the bewildering missionary challenge we face. The traditional marks all orbit around the practice of the sacraments. The Reformers argued about whether it was two, three, or seven (the Catholics), but they all agreed that the church is the place where the sacraments are administered and experienced. The problem with all these formulations, however, is that they effectively “institutionalize” grace by making it something that only the priests can handle, usually in “churchly” contexts. Gone is the idea of a people movement that so characterized the early church.</p>
<p>Gone is the idea of a Philip simply baptizing the eunuch, gone are the actual meals in houses that made communion a daily affair. Not to mention that they say nothing about mission, discipleship, and cultural life beyond the confines of the church institution itself. What is clearly inadequate can therefore prove to be culturally oppressive to the so-called laity—those believers who have to exercise their following of Jesus outside of the confines of the church’s organizational life. It’s time for a stretch, don’t you think?</p>
<p>In The Forgotten Ways I tell the story of how my own community had to get back to basics to assess if, and how, we were being an authentic and faithful expression of Jesus’ church. The outcomes of that inquiry I believe still stack up well in providing us with some working essentials for a New Testament ecclesiology (doctrine of the church).2 So this is Right Now what I believe is a useful (but not the only) way of identifying a faithful expression of church.</p>
<p>A church is...</p>
<ul>
<li>Centered on Jesus: He is the new covenant with God and</li>
</ul>
<p>he thus forms the true epicentre of an authentic Christ-ian faith. An ecclesia is not just a God-community—there are many such religious communities around. We are defined by our relationship to the Second Person of the Trinity, the Mediator, Jesus Christ. We believe in the Trinity to be sure, but take Jesus out and it simply isn’t a church anymore. A community centered on Jesus as Lord participates in the salvation that he brings. We receive the grace of God in him.</p>
<ul>
<li>A covenanted community: A church is a formed people,</li>
</ul>
<p>and not by people just hanging out together, but ones bound together in a distinctive bond. There is a certain obligation toward one another formed around a covenant. So here a covenant community is a network of relationships formed around Jesus our Lord. Remember this does not imply buildings per se.</p>
<p>But, more is required to truly constitute a church. Let me suggest that a true encounter with God in Jesus must result in...</p>
<ul>
<li>Worship: defined as offering our lives back to God</li>
</ul>
<p>through Jesus. Note that this is an all-of-life, biblically stretched definition. It includes communal praise and learning, but extends to every aspect of a life and a world offered back to God in worship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discipleship: defined as following Jesus and becoming</li>
</ul>
<p>increasingly like him (Christlikeness). Again, this is not just “church” as we tend to define it. It’s the relational fabric of the church that reaches way beyond organizational boundaries.</p>
<p>Recovering Missional Moxie</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission: defined as extending the mission (the redemptive purposes) of God through the activities of his people in every sphere and domain of life, including, of course, church planting but not confined to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there are five identifiers, or marks, in the above model.</p>
<p>Graphically it might look something like this: worship ant Commu ven nit Co y mission discipleship 4 5 We can easily see that these are profoundly interlinked and inform each other to create a complex phenomenon that constitutes the basics of church as Jesus intended. They describe the core (minimal?) aspects of a faithful ecclesia. If some are really missing, or are significantly diminished, we should be asking some serious questions about ourselves.</p>
<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>
<p>Another absolutely central issue we face in a world that is largely turning away from Christianity is that we have to reestablish credibility. That people all across America (and the Western world for that matter) think that Christ-ians are fundamentally unlike Christ is a serious problem! And research is clear on this trend;3 as we have seen, most people in the various neighborhoods and contexts we inhabit are actually very open to God, Jesus, and spirituality and are willing to engage in meaningful dialogue around these topics. What they manifestly are not open to is “the church.” That means the basics of our message are intact; but the medium of the message, the messengers so to speak, are excluded from the equation. And while “the church” is always an easy target and often gets unjustly bad press, this should give us pause to think seriously about what we are currently doing that gives the impression it seems to be giving.</p>
<p>Credibility is a major source of currency for any organization, but especially for the church that Jesus built, and its loss will almost definitely result in a proportionate loss of missional influence on those around about us. Let’s face it, if we are not fundamentally different from anyone else (and statistics indicate that this is the case in almost every sphere of morality: money, sex, and power), then why would anyone want to take on the “yoke” of the kingdom of God? If the gospel with all its demands of living under a Lord doesn’t seem to have any transformative effect on its messengers, why believe the Message?</p>
<p>Recovering Missional Moxie Without deemphasizing the contribution of the great missionaries like Paul, seminal sociologist of religion Rodney Stark in his various books maintains that the greatest factor in the growth of early Christianity was the example of ordinary Christians living out their faith in their communities.4 In fact, he documents the fact that Christianity grew substantially at the time of the terrible plagues that swept the Roman Empire in the first few centuries; there were massive spikes in the growth of the church around these times. The reason for these growth spurts, he suggests, was because while all the pagans abandoned their sick and ran to the hills, the Christians stayed behind to care for the sick and many of them died in this sacrificial service. But many of the sick survived to tell the tale, and tell it they did. The sheer mercy and goodness of the ordinary, marginalized Christians stunned the pagan peoples of that time because such Christlike compassion and service was unknown to them. It was the sheer goodness of the Christian church that established the moral credibility of its message and laid the grounds for the spiritual transformation of the Roman Empire. The early church did not seem to have the credibility gap that we so struggle with. The medium was the message! Jesus was alive and real in, and to, the people.</p>
<p>As far as I can discern, the only way for Christians to overcome our credibility gap, after centuries of Christianity, is by reactivating an authentic discipleship. Why? Because at its core, discipleship is becoming more like Jesus, or as I tag it in The Forgotten Ways, “becoming a little Jesus.” God knows, the world certainly doesn’t need more “religion”; but it can certainly do with a whole lot more Jesus-like people around the place. One of the key roles of Jesus in the life and imagination of believers is to provide a model for our own humanity. Jesus as Man is the prototypal humanity as God defines it. Ask yourself the question, how bad will I be if I became more and more like Jesus, the most perfect human who ever lived? And this is why getting back to the basics of discipleship is so essential to the mission of the church—it’s Right Now about establishing Christ’s presence everywhere through our lives as his people right here, right now, through the very medium of a life well lived. If we miss this... well, then surely it doesn’t really matter what we do elsewhere. In fact, as stated in Untamed and re Jesus, if we just simply get more “religious” and moralistic, then we are likely to do more damage than good.5</p>
<h2>All-Consuming Fires</h2>
<p>The overwhelming economic and social environment in which we are raised in the West profoundly impacts us all. We are all born into a culture that gets to shape us—in fact, disciple us—from the time of birth to death. The truth is that Western culture at the dawn of the twenty-first century is a particularly potent culture because of the omnipresent pervasiveness of media and the predominant role of market forces (with associated money and consumption) in our lives. We have to simply assume that the prevalent values and perspectives of the culture are being downloaded into each one of us from an early age; some of them are clearly good, some of them not so much.</p>
<p>The problem with these cultural ideas is that we generally can’t “see” them. Culture is invisible to those immersed in it; it’s like asking the proverbial fish to define water. We assume its rightness until we are confronted with an alternative vision of reality that calls it into question. It takes a fair bit of self-reflection, and I would say a very proactive, untamed discipleship in the Way of Jesus, to discern the darker sides of the culture. This is why the kingdom of God can only be experienced as a conversion from one system (kingdom) into another (e. g., Col. 1:13; 1 Thess. 1:9).</p>
<p>The point of this unnerving piece of information is that we simply have to be more aware of our own largely middleclass, and profoundly consumerist, biases if we are going to Recovering Missional Moxie be effective missional agents in our time. Once again, it’s not that being middle-class is wrong per se; it’s just that it has some values that are consistent with the kingdom of God, but make no mistake, it has others that work to undermine Jesus’ mission and purpose in the world.6 Obsession with personal security or the desire for increasing amounts of money and power are problematic when dealing with the Lord Jesus. Even something as seemingly right as “getting an education” can become an idol that is designed to secure ourselves and resist God’s will for our lives—and let me be clear here, I am not saying that education is wrong, far from it, but just like all things, it can become a means of disobedience and rebellion. Education is real social power and capital, and the fact is, we middle-class folk use it all the time; it’s unlikely to be spiritually neutral.</p>
<p>Likewise with consumerism; to buy things is basic to survival in a market-based economy like ours, but to be defined by what we buy is another thing altogether. The truth is that marketing exploits our deepest fears and desires in order to sell products. They have to. The factories and the economy produce much, much more than we need, so in order to keep the system operative, to make the capital work on its own terms, we have to keep the fires of consumption burning. To do this, marketing has to create desire and then seek to fulfill it through the purchasing of products. I am not being snide, cynical, or anticapitalist here, so please don’t dismiss what is being said for reasons of defensiveness. This is patently the case; consider how much of what you buy today will still be used by you in six months’ time. Research says that only 5 to 10 percent will still be in use in six months; the rest is either thrown out into the garbage or becomes someone else’s product—mostly thrown out.7 Track what happens to the Christmas toys you buy for the kids, or last season’s fashions, to make the point.</p>
<p>Heck, we all go into debt to buy things we don’t really need.</p>
<p>Ever asked why? What’s really driving us? Well, the aim is to Right Now create need in order to keep the factories, and therefore the economy, firing. But this takes a significantly spiritual twist in our own day—because in a more and more competitive environment, marketers have to reach deeper and deeper into human motivation to be able to sell us things we don’t really need. There is no doubt that when we go shopping, something akin to spirituality is at work. We buy not just to live and survive but also to fulfill a search for meaning, identity, purpose, and belonging. And here is where consumerism clashes with the claims of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And why is all this important? Well, apart from the serious implications for discipleship, global justice, and the environment, because it’s our culture, and as we saw in the briefing, sometimes in order to be faithful agents of the King, we simply have to subvert it. Also, we need to demonstrate, witness to, a more righteous way of life. The fact is that all the consumption and the relative wealth of people in the West has not made us happy at all. Depression and suicide are largely problems in Western cultural contexts. The children in America are more likely to kill themselves than those in a Brazilian slum! This has to say something to us. It’s a big elephant in the room and it has to be confronted if we are going to be missional Christians right here, right now.</p>

<p>Kingdom City Limits?</p>
<p>Here’s a biggie, and one most believers seldom, if ever, stop to think about even in a lifetime. It goes something like this: we tend to so completely identify the church with the kingdom of God that we end up with what we might call ecclesiocrasy (rule by the church). And if this sounds like a rather absurd notion (that the clergy once ruled the world), be assured that it has dominated European understandings of the church for a long, long time. In fact, this dangerous error of category lies at the root of false ideas of the church. For instance, when the Roman Catholic Church talks about the pope as Christ’s vicar, they mean that he is Jesus’ sole, authoritative representative, and that Christ rules his world through the medium of the church, of which the pope is the unquestioned boss! I kid you not. As far as I am aware, this basic understanding of the doctrine of the church is still held by the Catholic Church.8 But we all continue to get the distinction between kingdom and church very wrong, and with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Let me suggest that the basic mistake here is to make a complete correlation of the church—the redeemed community of Jesus’ people—with God’s kingdom—his active government or rule in the world.</p>
<p>Is the kingdom of God simply to be equated with the church?</p>
<p>I sincerely hope not. As much as I love the church and believe that it is a nonnegotiable part of God’s plan, it is to King Jesus Right Now and not any human agency that I must give my ultimate allegiance. The church is not simply the same as the kingdom.</p>
<p>The church is an expression of the kingdom, perhaps even the most consistent expression of it, but the kingdom (God’s active rule in and over his universe) is much larger than the church—in fact, it is cosmic in scope.</p>
<p>Reggie Mc Neal wisely suggests that we need a kingdomshaped view of the church, not a church-shaped view of the kingdom. In other words, as God’s people we must always assess ourselves in the light of God’s active rule in the world and not the other way around. Theologian Richard Neuhaus is right when he says, Our restless discontent should not be over the distance between ourselves and the first century Church but over the distance between ourselves and the Kingdom of God to which the Church then and now is the witness.9 Why all this church-kingdom stuff? Well, because if we are to be effective agents of God’s kingdom in this world, we need to be freed to see his kingdom express itself everywhere and anyplace—as indeed it does. God turns up in places where we might least expect to see him, but we need the eyes to see what he is doing if we are going to join him in the redemption of the world. Acomplete association of the kingdom with the church locks up God’s activity and links it exclusively to organized church activities like Sunday school, communal worship services, and the like. And as wonderful and necessary as these are to Christian community, the diminished view of the kingdom that results from this will never get us beyond the four walls of the church so that we might fulfill our mission of discipling the nations.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God can’t be institutionalized in this way. To the contrary, it challenges all these idolatrous attempts to control it—be it churchly and otherwise! Besides, it’s not about simply getting more church-based services up Recovering Missional Moxie to scratch; it is going to take the whole body of Christ as a fluid, dynamic, witnessing agency, active in every possible arena of life, to bring the gospel of God’s love into his world.</p>
<p>This, in fact, goes to the heart of our mission in the world.</p>

<p>Traditional Boundaries</p>
<h2>Attractional-Extractional</h2>
<p>Another elephant in the room is the whole issue of what has come to be called the attractional versus missional church debate. As someone responsible for helping introduce the term into common parlance, let me try to explain it. When we use the term attractional, it is an attempt to describe how we conceive of our church in relation to our culture. In other words, it describes our missionary stance or the expectations we have about the role that church plays in our contexts.</p>
<p>To grasp the importance of this, consider the idea of cultural distance.10 This is a conceptual tool that we can use to discern just how far a person or a people group is from a meaningful engagement with the gospel. In order to determine this, we have to see it on a scale that goes something like this: m0 m1 m2 m3 m4</p>
<p>Each numeral with the prefix m indicates one significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of the gospel. An obvious example of such a barrier would be language. All would agree that if you have to reach across a language barrier, you have got a problem and it’s going to take Right Now some time to communicate meaningfully. But others could be race, history, religion/worldview, culture, etc. The more boundaries one has to cross, the harder meaningful communication will be. So for instance, in I slamic contexts, the gospel has struggled to make any significant inroads because religion, race, and a whole lot of history make a meaningful engagement with the gospel very difficult indeed. But this is not limited to overseas missions; it is directly related to missionality right here, right now.</p>
<p>Let me bring it closer to home by applying it to the various spheres in which we have to live. If you see yourself (or your church for that matter) standing on the m0 point above, this is how we might interpret our own context(s): m0–m1 Those with some concept of Christianity who speak the same language, have similar interests, probably the same nationality, and are from a similar class grouping as you or your church.</p>
<p>Most of your friends would probably fit into this bracket. m1–m2 Here we go to the average non-Christian in our context: a person who has little real awareness of, or interest in, Christianity but is suspicious about the church (they have heard bad things). These people might be politically correct, socially aware, and open to spirituality. This category might also include those previously offended by a bad experience of church or Christians—some call them “bruised fruit” and they are hard to reach. Just go to the average local pub/bar or nightclub to encounter these people. m2–m3 People in this group probably have no idea about Christianity. Or they might be part of some ethnic group with different religious impulses or some fringy subculture. This category might also include people marginalized by conservative Christianity—e. g., the gay community. But m2–m3ers are also likely to describe people actively antagonistic toward Christianity as they understand it.</p>
<p>e. g., the new atheists. m3–m4 This group might be inhabited by ethnic and religious groupings with a bad history of the church—e. g., Muslims or Jews. The fact that they are in the West might ameliorate some of the distance, but just about everything else gets in the way of a meaningful dialogue. They are highly resistant to the gospel. Or they are people of completely different language, experience, and worldview. Some immigrant/refugee communities might fit here.</p>
<p>Recovering Missional Moxie We are all deeply scripted to believe that we must bring people to our church, and so we seldom take into account the cultural dynamics inherent in that equation. But it’s all about culture. Our church has a distinct culture, as do the people we are hoping to reach! In fact, as we saw in the briefing, I believe we have come to a situation where all mission in Western settings now should be considered a cross-cultural enterprise.</p>
<p>And remember the obstinate little truth that it is we who are the “sent” people of God, and whatever that means to our identity as God’s people, it must also sometimes mean we must go to where the people are. If we fail to “go” to the people, then to encounter the gospel meaningfully they must “come.” This is the inbuilt assumption of the attractional church; and it requires that the nonbeliever do all the crosscultural work to find Jesus, and not us! Make no mistake: for many people, coming to church involves some serious crosscultural work for them. They have to be the missionaries!</p>
<p>Another very important fact must be remembered here. We know from now old research that within three to five years of a person becoming a Christian, they will have no meaningful relationships with anyone outside the church. So, assuming that we bring them to our church, and we happen to do a good job at it and effectively socialize them into our church community, we are in effect snapping the natural, organic connections that they have with the host community they come from. This is very problematic because we know that the gospel travels along relational lines. Sever the relationships and we effectively stop the outward movement of the gospel into the broader culture. In other words, attractional evangelism in missionary contexts results in extracting them from their previous relationships and cultural context. This is a big no-no if we are serious about initiating movements right here, right now.</p>
<p>And this is not to say that churches should not gather. Of course we should—churches are worshiping communities.</p>
<p>Right Now Nor is it saying we should not be thoroughly attractive when we do. We should be as culturally spicy as we possibly can be. It simply means that when engaging people in m1–m4 distance from us, we should gather incarnationally within a host culture/community and not necessarily extract people from their cultural tribe(s) into our church tribe.</p>
<p>Attractional forms of church in missionary contexts eventually are self-defeating because the church quickly exhausts its supply of relationships and because the new converts quickly become a cultural clique or religious ghetto increasingly marginalized from the original culture.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>Over many years of being involved in missional expressions of church, I perceive one of the biggest issues facing the movement as a whole is that of sustainability. Tragically, many wonderful, spunky people start out with all the right ideas only to end up exhausted and marginalized because they have simply become, well... unsustainable.</p>
<p>Part of the issue many disciples face is that of lifestyle and the cultural expectations associated with life in the suburbs— no small matter and one that should be reflected on under the rubric of discipleship. For most believers, the idea of missional discipleship seems like a far-off dream because they work most of the time, come home exhausted, spend what little spare time they have with family and kids, and don’t seem to have any time for anything else. Now I don’t mean to diminish the sacredness of work and family, but if work is too demanding for us to involve ourselves in being authentic disciples in realms other than work, it is the dominance of our work that should be questioned and not the viability of our discipleship. Work like this is more of an enslaving thing than it is a means of living. We can all live with a lot less.</p>
<p>Work four days a week instead of five, if only to find more Recovering Missional Moxie space for God in your life, let alone serve others. Much real life, relationships, and spiritual meaning can be added by simplifying our lives in order to engage more fully in Life.</p>
<p>Another aspect of unsustainability is the loner mentality that goes along with American individualism. Clearly there are times when one cannot avoid being something of a lone ranger, but we have to learn to see this as the exception that only proves the rule. Jesus always intended that we should seek to engage in mission two by two at the very least (Luke 10).</p>
<p>Not all of us will be involved in establishing new communities of faith (what I called in the briefing, apostolic mission), but all of us ought to be involved in community life in one way or another. And mission in the Way of Jesus should always aim at developing communities of Jesus followers—isn’t that what Jesus did? Paul? Other heroes of faith?</p>
<p>In terms of sustainable multiplication church planting associated with people movements, I have always felt that a group of about 30 to 120 has a much greater chance of survival than the smaller cell-group size. Mike Breen, a deeply apostolic friend of mine, rightly notes that this is because what he calls “midsize communities” have their own inbuilt ecology of survival, especially when each person in the group really looks after the other and is mutually involved in worship, play, economics, and life together. He says we are “hardwired for extended family.” We simply don’t flourish in the smaller, more nuclear, versions of family, and we are depersonalized in the much larger “tribal” gatherings.11 Not too big to be unwieldy and mechanical, not too small to seem closed and distressed—that is the trick. But the genius of this lies in the fact that it is church that nonprofessionals can handle and therefore anyone can do. And it’s the basis of sustainability.</p>
<p>But a movement that can change the world has to be larger than a local midsized community. I believe strongly in the power of networks and networking.12 Networks are the fabric of movements and are formed by relationships and mutuality beyond the local expression of church or mission. Through a Right Now network, we become a working part of the whole of what God is doing in a city—part of something bigger. It’s being part of a movement. These networks should be sought after and developed. Depending on where one is starting, as a brandnew pioneering project or an essential, innovative part of an existing church, it is important to seek connection to likeminded established churches, organizations, and networks.</p>
<p>The trick is to find a balance of interdependence and not to be dominated by the agenda of some centralist organization.</p>
<p>Networks exist on synergistic, win-win relationships throughout the system. Therefore identify and associate with those who understand and practice this.</p>
<p>The other key area of sustainability is the area of finances. Many of the readers of this book will not be churchbased professionals and are already involved in “regular jobs” whatever that might mean. Much is to be gained by looking at the idea of business as mission (BAM). BAM approaches don’t accept the dualism that separates the secular from the sacred and sees that all of life can, and indeed must, be made sacred by engaging it in Jesus’ name... including business. The businesses most likely to engage people personally are obviously the best ways to engage missionally (cafés, Laundromats, coaching, HR, etc.), but even less people-oriented businesses (e. g., engineering firms) have employees who are not disciples of Jesus. These businesses provide a wonderful opportunity for God’s kingdom to express itself through his people. In the hands of a missional Christian, the business can become a wonderful tool in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In terms of forms of support, in The Shaping of Things to Come we suggest that financial support could also come in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal support/sponsors: imagine for instance forty</li>
</ul>
<p>people giving $1/day to your support—most of us can get that form of support together.</p>
<p>Recovering Missional Moxie</p>
<ul>
<li>Working part-time: great way of modeling what we are</li>
</ul>
<p>asking others to do while engaging non-Christians and keeping our nonchurch skills up.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the established church: if what you are doing can</li>
</ul>
<p>be envisioned as part of the broader mission of the local church, then it is not too much to ask for (and expect) a budget allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social entrepreneurialism and BAM as described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixture of all of the above.</p>

<h2>Getting Over Risk Aversion</h2>
<p>By and large the church as we know it tends to embody a culture of social restraint and risk aversion. We do not tend to think of “church” as a place where we are likely to experience life-defying adventure... or any at all for that matter.</p>
<p>Now clearly there is a role for creating a safe environment to raise children and to worship, but when our need for safety overwhelms our vision of a better world, and stifles our sense of obligation to this mission, then there is a need for a serious rethink. The church that Jesus built should be a place of learning and adventurous discipleship. And these by definition Right Now must involve to some degree the willingness to experiment, to take risks with people, to venture out into the world in order to change it.</p>
<p>The truth is, mission is risky. It involves putting ourselves out of our comfort zones and dealing with people we ordinarily might not engage with. And far from being bad for us, taking risks is actually good for the soul, necessary to a healthy learning process, and vital for innovation in all social contexts. Risk aversion, when it becomes part of the culture of church, will result in a stifling status quo that will resist anything, including God, which comes along to disturb it.</p>
<p>We do well to consider that Jesus is always “dangerous” to our all-too-human penchant for safety and security. He is a Lord, how else could it be otherwise?</p>

<p>This chapter is filled with both a sense of urgency and a sense of desperation. Urgency, because it’s hard to dodge the fact that the twenty-first century presents a major challenge to Christianity as we currently know it. Think about any science fiction movie of significance. Is there any mention at all in them of even the possibility of Christian faith? I certainly cannot recall any. And remember, science fiction, as a literary genre, is about human imagination exploring the possibilities of the future... whether they be nightmarish or utopian.</p>
<p>The fact that the church is missing from the genre means that it plays no significant role in the imagination of what the Recovering Missional Moxie future holds. It’s seen as irrelevant to the great issues of our day—people are not looking in our direction to lead them into the future... and yet who better to do that very thing?</p>
<p>Henri Nouwen underscored the perception of those outside the church as he told the story of serving as a chaplain of a cruise ship that was navigating a dangerous fog. “The captain, carefully listening to a radar station operator who was explaining his position between other ships, walked nervously up and down the bridge and shouted his orders to the steersman.” When he suddenly stumbled over Nouwen, he blurted out what a lot of people think about the church and its ministry: “God damn it, Father, get out of my way.” When it came down to navigating the ship out of danger, Nouwen felt totally useless and unwanted—it seemed that chaplains are only called in to life out of a sense of an obligatory tip of the hat to religion.14 The reality is, we have been pushed from the places where it really matters. Even if we can project ourselves onto the end of the twenty-first century, what will we see there in terms of viable Christian faith? To be honest, I find it very hard to see the privatized, institution-based religion that we experience now surviving into any of these futures—at least as a significant social force for good. That is, unless we adapt. It’s all there in the “unless”—the possibility of repentance and change.</p>
<p>I believe with every inch of my soul that the church that Jesus built, when it is authentic and true, is by far and away the most powerful force for the transformation of the world.</p>
<p>The gospel will always be the good news of God that always addresses the human situation. But the church as we know it is going to have to become more aligned with it, more relevant in all spheres of life, more missional right here, right now, if it is going to effectively deliver its Message to the end of this, what will prove to be an extremely challenging, century.</p>
<p>The desperation I feel stems from knowing that we have a great opportunity right here, right now to recalibrate ourselves for what is coming. In fact, I believe that this recalibration, this rebooting, is well under way. We can, and I believe Right Now will, become a people movement again. But only if we can awaken both sides of the movement equation as discussed in the briefing. We need the apostolic mission to engage in exponential church planting, creating communities of faith wherever and whenever we can—many of them, and much more diverse than what we now experience. But the other side is also vitally important. We need to awaken the sheer missional moxie of God’s people as a whole. And we all need to recognize and live out the reality that we are all commissioned (dare I say, ordained) agents of the King, and we live out that agency in every sphere and domain of society.</p>
<p>Everyone gets to play! If we fail to awaken the sleeping giant of the body of Christ, then I believe our opportunity will be lost and the church will continue to decline, and eventually become a mere cultural footnote to Western history.</p>
<p>Much depends on our choices and actions now. I dream that some brothers and sisters, standing at the dawn of the next century, will look back to our time and say that the course of history was changed because many of us broke from the herd and under God rediscovered our courage, along with the missional potentials that lie dormant in God’s people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night
in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find
that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are danger-
make it possible.

<p>Notes</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Addison notes that preexisting relationships are a critical factor for the</li>
</ol>
<p>exponential growth of a movement. “New religious movements fail when they become closed or semi-closed networks. For continued exponential growth, a movement must maintain open relationships with outsiders. They must reach out into new, adjacent social networks.” Stephen Addison, “Movement Dynamics: Keys to the Expansion and Renewal of the Church in Mission” (unpublished manuscript, 2003), 52. Stark argues that as movements grow, their “social surface” expands exponentially. Each new member opens up new networks of relationships between the movement and potential members—provided the movement continues to remain an open system. The forms of social networks will differ from culture to culture, but “however people constitute structures of direct interpersonal attachments, those structures will define the lines through which conversion will most readily proceed.” Rodney Stark, The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal, Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1996), 22.</p>

<p>Plato’s idea of the Republic as the mediating institution between the real world of ideas and the false world of senses. The church assumes the role of mediating agent between God and the people.
