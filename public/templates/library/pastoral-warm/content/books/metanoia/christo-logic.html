this ability so characteristic of Jesus is given to those who love Jesus

<p>Philippians 2:1–3). But, far from being something ethereal and elusive, this “mind of Christ” given to disciples enables them to behold this world as it really is because they can see the world through the Logos, the creative and redemptive person of Christ.4 As the ancient liturgy proclaims: “Because through the mystery of the incarnate Word, the new light of your brightness has shone onto the eyes of our mind; that knowing God visibly, we might be snatched up by this into the love of invisible things.”5</p>
<p>Metanoia as the Gateway to the “Mind of Christ”
So how do we access this mind of Christ, and what role does metanoia
play in relation to it? Well, according to Alister Mc Grath, the purpose

“For who has known the mind of the Lord

But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>1 C O R I N T H IA N S 2: 6 – 1 6 N R S V
In the broader context of these verses (1 Corinthians 1:18–31), Paul makes</p>
<p>a clear distinction between the religious beliefs held by Jews, Greeks, and
by leaving behind their previous religious practices and beliefs in order to
saying that what had previously supplied their answers and enlightened
previous outlooks on life. As a result, Jesus has given them a new consci-
hing.10 Receiving a new heart, as we shall explore in a later chapter, is like
and a new mental map of the world (Ephesians 4:23; Colossians 3:10–11;
and a deeper soul resonance with the things of God.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Christ and the Mind of Christ
As we have already noted, there is nothing automatic about receiving
the mind of Christ. It is an action of God’s pure and unimaginable grace,
the process of sanctification, to an ever-greater attunement to the holy,
of Christ is only achieved through the indwelling of God the Holy Spirit.
[We] walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those
who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but
Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit

<p>R OM A N S 8: 4 B – 1 1 N R S V
Receiving the mind of Christ is therefore a profoundly spiritual process.</p>
<p>Von Balthasar notes that in this process “the Holy Spirit implants the mind of the Son of God into our hearts so that we may fashion our lives accordingly.”11 He goes on to say that “the Holy Spirit can be recognized at work in a person by establishing in them the mind of Jesus.”12 Jesus tells his disciples that the Spirit “will take what is mine and declare it to you” (John 16:15 ESV), and Paul tells the Corinthian church that “we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image … For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18 ESV, italics ours).13</p>
<p>And so we discover that the Spirit’s role in Christian community is not
to replace an absent Jesus, but on the contrary to render him present in new,
and intensely personal, ways. And it is the fundamental mission of the Holy
with Christ. The Spirit is the agent by which the mind of Christ is given.

depths of God and enables the intellect to grasp these realities [the

<h3>Christo-Logic is Formatted According to the Pattern of Christ</h3>
<p>Because metanoia calibrates the believer to Christ, who is also the Word
of God, Christo-logic is therefore the kind of logic that is derived from the
Mind and are operating accordingly is through the prism of Jesus’ life and
because Jesus is the fulfillment of the messianic logic laced throughout the
communicating his mind to us (Hebrews 1:1–3; Colossians 1:17). “Christ
account of truth, of the God-World relation, can only be found in Christ.”16</p>
<p>The Bible issues us with a summons to metanoia, to leave everything and to
follow Jesus Christ, to take him as the measure of all things, as the singular
point of reference for understanding ourselves and our world.17 Therefore,
thoughts, events, and actions of Jesus’ life, and think outwards from there.</p>
<p>Whoever wants to be Jesus’ disciple is called first to repentance, then to take up their cross and follow Jesus by conforming their lives to him in discipleship (Matthew 16:24). It is by having Jesus at the center of our lives and consciousness, by being decentered from the false narratives and identities that have previously defined us, that we experience transformation: “And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18).</p>
<p>This ability to both recognize the Christ-pattern underlying the world
and attune ourselves to it is critical. (See appendix four on conforming to
the image of God in Jesus.) Absolutely everything is to be understood in
our particular calling and purpose; human life as God intended; how the
our daily decisions; discerning the hand of God in the world; and serving</p>

According to Paul, the whole world is created by the Father in the pattern</p>
<p>of the Son; and “in him all things hold together” (Colossians 1:17).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we must focus on Jesus to discern God’s original purpose in everything created. Just as the individual pieces of a puzzle only make sense by being set within the completed puzzle, so “everything” finds its proper place in him, and all the fragmented and dislocated pieces of our world are put back together in him. The more we let the life and events of Christ’s life inform and imprint us, the more we will be able to connect our own daily stories with the greater story of God’s presence in our lives.</p>

—Ephesians 1:17–23 (MSG, italics ours)
If we miss what God is doing in Jesus, we are utterly lost, for we will never
be able to comprehend God. But not only do we solely know God through
as God intended it. Or as N. T. Wright says,
If you want to know who God is, look at Jesus. If you want to know what
it means to be human, look at Jesus. If you want to know what love is,
looking until you’re not just a spectator, but you’re actually part of the</p>
<p>In other words, Jesus is God’s way of being human, and he sets the arche-</p>
<p>supply the norm for the life of the following Christian and thus for the life of the whole church.”20 The seventeenth-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal agrees: “Jesus is the center of all, the object of all; whoever does not know him, knows nothing aright, either of the world or of himself.”21 Bonhoeffer maintains that “[t]he way in which the form of Jesus Christ takes form in our world is the concrete, obedient, con-formation of human beings to the form of the biblical Christ, the man whose existence for others is the world’s true reality.”22 Humans are therefore to be “ordered to” Jesus. Only in him is humanity comprehensible.</p>
<p>The church, as the communal human expression of the person and
ministry of Christ, is by no means peripheral to what God is doing; it is
right at the center. As the body of Christ, the church is meant to be the
a living “proof of concept”—of what God intends for the entire human

the church of his day. The so-called Christians of the time had become
exclusive and archetypal significance that the Jesus of the Gospels has for
individually and communally, was to conform themselves to him in the
would be no conformation to Jesus. Bonhoeffer saw that there was a direct</p>
<p>Discipleship means adherence to Christ, and, because Christ is the
abstract Christology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge
superfluous, and in fact they positively exclude any idea of discipleship
following Christ … Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably
always Christianity without Christ.23
After losing their first (defining) love, much of the German church of</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer’s time had literally become a Christ-less abomination—a
Jesus, their eternal Archetype, Founder, and Lord.24
And so the form of Christ is critically important because it helps us</p>
<p>recognize and evaluate the authenticity of a group of people claiming to
require a spiritual sensibility to understand and appropriate this logic. For
Christ to recognize a world that is deeply out of sync with God’s intended
jar us. As people who have been “born from above,” we should feel it
and brought into more recognizable alignment with Jesus. But we can
perfectly represented in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 4:13). (See appendix one</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are not left to our own devices regarding our
deepening attunement to God in Jesus. It is the role of the indwelling
Spirit—in the individual disciple as well as in the believing community—
to him.
It is the work of the Holy Spirit to accomplish the continuing enfleshment
of the Word in a universal fashion. It is the Spirit who transposes Christ’s
norm of every life. In this way the Holy Spirit creates the missions of
Christian life and the whole life of the Church.25
Only by undergoing metanoia can we, as people who are committed to</p>
<p>being indexed to Jesus through prayer and discipleship, relinquish prior</p>
<h3>Christo-Logic is Seeing Everything from God's Perspective</h3>
<p>We have already noted that metanoia is the door by which we gain
access to the mind of Christ. This is because metanoia creates the appro-
encounter God and to be changed and transformed. As inconceivable
ousness; and because of this, disciples gain a Christlike perspective on</p>
<p>mind governed by the flesh” [Romans 8:6]).26 Paul exhorts the church in Colossae to “look up, and be alert to what is going on around Christ— that’s where the action is. See things from his perspective” (Colossians 3:2 MSG).27 It is through the mind of Christ that we can see the world with panoramic and unambiguous vision. In his book Seeing and Believing, Devenish says that, through metanoia,</p>
<p>[Believers] have been given access to a new dimension of reality that
have been made privy to a special kind of knowledge that does not
sustain this transformative vision, this luminescent wisdom in the
hold their gaze … When we do [on occasion] turn our eyes away to
return our gaze once again to the face of Christ. To look inwardly is
of view.28
Many of the problems we face come from having our own finite</p>
<p>perspective rather than seeing things from God’s infinite perspective.</p>
<p>It was a limited, earthly perspective that lay at the core of Peter’s reproach of Jesus in Matthew 16. Although Peter’s earlier declaration of Jesus as the Messiah was revealed to him by the Father (16:17), moments later he rebuked Jesus for setting his mind on the forthcoming ordeal of the cross. At which point, “Jesus turned to Peter and said, ‘Get away from me, Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me.</p>
<p>You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God’s’” (16:23 NLT). It seems that Peter—and we with him—had been going about things in the wrong way. Instead of trying to see God, he should have tried to see as God sees.29 Without the benefit of the mind of Christ, we will remain trapped within a culturally defined, reductive, and “worldly” logic. This limited logic is futile because it is what created the problems we face in the first place. Echoing this idea, missiologist and missionary Ralph Winter used to constantly remind us that “every major decision you make will be faulty until you see the whole world as God sees it.”30</p>
<p>Here is a little exercise to test this issue of perspective in your own life.</p>
<p>Prayerfully ask Jesus what he thinks about the issues of wealth and money and about the assumptions that are built into the capitalist understanding of how the world ought to work (for example, meritocracy, plutocracy, property rights). Got some in mind? Write them down as bullet points on one side of a piece of paper. Then, on the other half of the paper, jot down what the world outside of Christ thinks about the same issues. Now compare the lists. How do these differ? No doubt you will quickly observe how contrary Jesus’ way is to the world’s “normal.” Now, try tackling the complex issues of power and its abuse, using the same approach. As part of this exercise, ask yourself how you are structuring the organization you lead in this respect. Ask yourself how we justify our attachments to hierarchy and top-down forms of leadership when Jesus expressly forbids this to his followers (Matthew 20:25–28; cf. Philippians 2:1–11).</p>
<p>What about issues of race, of gender, forgiveness, service, or how to treat enemies? What about how we view suffering or the trials we face? Things are very different when you compare the human-only view (“the mind of the flesh”) with Jesus’ perspective.</p>
<p>It is because the ways of Jesus are so confronting to our standard ways
of seeing that we can acknowledge why repentance is essential for us to
gain his perspective on our world and our role within it.</p>
<h3>Christo-Logic is a Form of Thinking That Can Always Transcend I tself</h3>
<p>In an earlier chapter, we discovered that learning—growing in awareness

This “delighting in discovery” is a key part of our formation in the way</p>

that “when the eye of the soul turns towards God, it is thrown back by

<p>the self-enclosed categories of the human mind. Christians have long confessed that while God is indeed fully immanent and can be found in all things, he is also transcendent and cannot be fully contained in any created thing. Just when we think we have God all worked out, we quickly realize we haven’t even really started.33 In other words, God’s truth has ascendancy over our own truth, and we ought to live our lives accordingly.</p>
<p>If this is the case when it comes to the knowledge of God, then it must
also mean that metanoia—the process of constantly having our minds
blown—plays an essential role. There can be no dodging it. Gregory of
also committed to seeking him unceasingly. “The reward of the search

<p>Authentic belief in God assumes we are somehow related to a Being
that is infinitely greater. This eternal God is revealed and known in Jesus,
but this God can never be pinned down by human thought or rationality.</p>
<p>As any number multiplied by infinity is infinite, so we must recognize that the eternal, because it is eternal, qualifies everything.</p>
<p>Theologians have long used the phrase sub specie aeternitatis to
describe the idea of seeing the world through the lens of eternity, in which
we acknowledge our own limited thinking. We believe such infinity-
just necessary for the mystical knowledge of God; it gives the believer a</p>
<p>This approach to thinking is not only important in the realm of theology,
but it is also a useful category in the world of leadership and organization.</p>
<p>I nfinity-thinking means being able to always think beyond the current categories. For instance, leadership guru Simon Sinek uses the metaphor of what he calls “the infinite game” to suggest that infinity-thinking is critical to remaining adaptive and responsive to ever-changing conditions. He notes that games such as basketball and chess are finite, with firm rules and clear endpoints; but business or politics (or church for that matter) is an infinite game. There’s ultimately no such thing as “winning” in these types of “games” because there’s always a new set of challenges to deal with. Therefore, those who thrive in the long run are those who play by infinite rules. This enables them to maneuver, innovate, and thrive in VUCA conditions.36</p>
<p>However, this way of thinking is not easy. Most people operate with a
thoroughly non-metanoic way of seeing the world. Aclosed mind locks
them into their prevailing thinking on any matter. Sinek again:
For all its benefits, acting with an infinite, long-term view is not easy. It
takes real effort. As human beings we are naturally inclined to seek out
wins to advance our ambitions. We tend to see the world in terms of

The non-metanoic mind is unable to transcend itself because it is</p>

cally motivated, fundamentalist religion/s of our day, be they Christian,</p>
<p>Very few people evolve much beyond the thinking of their last
experience of formal education, such as high school or university.39 As
Sinek notes, it takes significant courage to vacate outmoded ideas, and
bound to the obsolete—things that once worked but no longer do. This is
of church and ministry.
Metanoia broadens our horizons and offers us a wider perspective</p>
<p>on things. We recognize opportunities and paths that were unexpected

<p>This is a time for un/learning if ever there was one. And the advan-

learn, to adapt, is a superpower. The rate at which you learn and progress
new ideas, even if you don’t at first agree with them; perhaps especially if</p>
<p>you feel threatened by them. As we have already noted, one of the great gifts of Christo-logic is that it allows us to solve the problems of our world from outside of the closed-loop thinking that created those problems in the first place.40</p>
<h3>Christo-Logic is Holistic Thinking</h3>
<p>Many of our problems derive from an innate tendency to fall prey to the
all-too-human proclivity to demystify, to eliminate paradox, and make
that occurs in all forms of human knowledge and arises when we try to
mental constituents. These reduced ways of seeing reality become the
these minimal and fragmented formulas for reality itself. Now to be
one dimension of the process of knowledge. The other, counterbalancing,
in light of a greater whole.
Science and philosophy call the results of this over-analysis “reduc-</p>
<p>tionism.” The Bible also has a term for it: “heresy.” No kidding! Heresy is
is a form of idolatry. As N. T. Wright notes, “Heresies do not come about
even be important, but isn’t central, looms so large that people can’t help
were the only thing that mattered.”41 Or, as C. S. Lewis says, “We have all
of us wants to make out that his own modification of the original plan is
out those bits and leave the rest.”42 Heresy is like the parable of the various
object. For example, the man who grabs the trunk believes he is holding a</p>
<p>In other words, heresy produces a fragmented consciousness incapable
of experiencing the fullness that is offered to us through Jesus. We suggest
that most of the problems we now face as Christian leaders arise from</p>
<p>The only way to heal our reduced thinking therefore involves the
reversal that comes through metanoia—the ability to think beyond the
current limitations by reintegrating the fragmented part back into the
when theologians say that truth is “catholic” or “universal.” The term
the Greek words kata+holon and literally means that we are to measure
shalom, which not only means peace as the absence of conflict but also
things catholically is to understand all things as parts of a greater whole.
This is where the mind of Christ comes into play. We have already seen</p>
<p>that, for Christians, the whole of reality can only be understood through
his life, ministry, death, and resurrection. “He is before all things, and in
dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether
1:3–15). And so—like the puzzle we referred to earlier, or a mosaic that can
picture—thinking through the mind of Christ helps us to see beyond the
whole: the purposes of God in and through all things.
Synthesis—the healing of our heresies—tends to explain reality</p>
<p>by understanding that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (as well as social psychologist Daniel Pink) calls this reach for wholeness symphonic thinking. Think about an orchestra tuning up; the notes are discordant until the sounds of various instruments combine and blend to create an emergent new sound.</p>
<p>Symphonic theology, like all forms of true art, requires imagination, holism, and play, along with diversity in unity. By renewing and enlarging imagination and vision, it leads directly to innovation and other various forms of creative learning. Theologically, we can say that because God’s truth is living and dynamic and continues to unfold itself in new and fresh ways, it is essentially “symphonic.”44</p>
<p>Renewal—spiritual, social, or organizational—in some sense means
always returning the fragments to the originating whole and in so doing
rediscovering new meanings.45 It means understanding things through</p>
<p>we resolve our current problems not by more (reductive) analysis but by more synthesis. It is this symphonic way of thinking that connects the dots, opens doors, and cleanses perceptions to enable us to really see again.46 This "thinking through the mind of the Creator" will always involve counter-reductionist thinking—thinking bigger, never smaller.</p>
<h3>Christo-Logic is Spiritual I nstinct</h3>
<p>The New Testament clearly teaches that when an individual comes to exist
in Christ, Christ in turn exists in them. This is precisely what is conveyed
well as the “in Christ” teaching found throughout Paul’s writings (e. g.,
implications for the life of a believer.
As disciples, this union with Christ is usually experienced as an</p>
<p>inbuilt bias to all-things-Jesus. This instinct for Jesus involves a sense of
15:1–17). This spiritual inclination will include a sense of the whole in
attunement to Christ. Although this instinct is experienced at the level
Christoform pattern. It is the wisdom inherent in the mind of Christ.47
Spiritual instinct therefore is that aspect of Christo-logic that enables</p>
<p>us to intuit ways to solve our problems and to negotiate the complexities
Scripture (e. g., 1 John 2:27), and under the active leadership and guidance</p>
<p>An analogy of this implicit, instinctive knowledge can be seen in
animals. For instance, sharks are clearly adept swimmers, and yet they
do so without ever cognitively “knowing” anything at all about a theory
somehow built into the very nature and purpose, latent in the DNA, of the
birds to navigate from one single point in the globe to another without
pure instinct. All of God’s creatures live according to such instinct.
Because of our penchant for both rationalizing and controlling life,</p>
<p>it sometimes takes liminal situations to force us to rediscover these

<p>In these situations, the standard logic does not readily apply, and we
find ourselves operating on gut instinct—what Daniel Kahneman refers
to as “thinking fast” and Malcolm Gladwell calls “blink” insight. Gladwell

state of mind commonly referred to as the “paralysis of analysis.” Gladwell

It therefore should not surprise us that a corresponding superna-</p>
<p>tural instinct ought to pervade the Christian life as well. We need to

The examples of intuition found in the natural world help us</p>
<p>understand the presence of a similar intuitive form of knowledge built</p>
<p>into the being of the body of Christ. The mind of Christ is therefore a form of tacit knowledge, latent throughout the church, as well as in individual disciples. This latency, or blink-instinct, is a dimension of Christo-logic that is available to all of God’s people through the Holy Spirit—who connects us to Jesus and the latent intelligences built into his body.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most explicit example of latent spiritual instincts is found
in Paul’s teaching on the five intelligences and instincts (what I refer to as
fivefold intelligence or 5Q) bequeathed to the body of Christ (Ephesians

</ol>
<p>Because we have been given access to the mind of Christ through
metanoia, an instinct for all things Jesus and his mission should direct
and pervade all aspects of Christian life and ministry. Certainly this
outward in its Holy Spirit inspired Jesus-mission to change the world.</p>
<p>That same mind of Christ is operating in us and ought therefore to infuse our current efforts as we seek to walk in his way and extend his mission.</p>
<h3>Christo-Logic is Discerning What God is Doing and Joining with Him</h3>
<p>As we saw in chapter two, because conversion involves a radical reorien-
tation and recentering on Jesus (te/shuva), as well as a reception of a
therefore more able to discern his purposes in our world so that we might</p>
<p>Everything Jesus did, and everything about him as the Son of God, was
received from, and calibrated to, God the Father. Jesus said, “The truth is
that the Son does nothing on His own; all these actions are led by the Father.</p>
<p>The Son watches the Father closely and then mimics the work of the Father” (John 5:19 The Voice). Whether in a church gathering or at the pub, Jesus is always looking for what the Father is already doing, and he subsequently partners with the Father in that work. Listen again to Jesus:</p>
<p>“I have not ever acted, and will not in the future act, on My own. I listen
tions. For this reason, My judgment is always fair and never self-serving.
—John 5:30–31 (The Voice)
Jesus’ perspective did not originate from egoistic self-centeredness but</p>
<p>came from seeing the world with a God’s-eye point of view.
And when Jesus taught the disciples, he intended that they would</p>
<p>increasingly adopt his point of view as their own (Philippians 2:5). And that
the apostles began to participate in Jesus’ mission to the world. This was not
following the traces of the redeeming God in the world. Their actions were
same point of view they saw Jesus apply. They literally looked through Jesus’
at work in them and through them.56 Through their conversion, they had</p>
<p>“I’m no longer calling you servants because servants don’t understand
because I’ve let you in on everything I’ve heard from the Father.”</p>
<h2>JOHN 15:15 MSG</h2>
<p>We believe this ability to find God everywhere and join in whatever he
is doing lies at the core of Jesus’ consciousness and must therefore be an
aspect of the mind of Christ bequeathed to his people. This means we
as well as how and where he is doing it. Therefore, instead of ministry</p>
<p>about discovering what God is already doing, and—considering our gifts and resources—discerning how he wants us to join him.57</p>
<p>Be assured that from the first day we heard of you, we haven’t stopped
praying for you, asking God to give you wise minds and spirits attuned
to his will, and so acquire a thorough understanding of the ways in
—Colossians 1:15–20 (MSG)
And so we have discovered that metanoia allows us to perceive and</p>
<p>understand the pattern and form of Christ, respond to it, and to align
access to the infinite mind of God in Christ.
In a living faith, human inadequacy and ignorance are outbalanced by
divine omnipotence and omniscience; it is part of the contemplative’s
but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words”, by
us and from within us.58</p>
<p>Metanoia starts with repentance, re/turning, re/orienting, and re/framing; and leads to re/newal, re/storation, re/aligning, and re/calibrating of the church and individual disciple.</p>
