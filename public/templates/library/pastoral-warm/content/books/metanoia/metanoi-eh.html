<h1>Chapter 2: Metanoi-eh?</h1>

<p>Leave off buying and selling, and start looking. Open your eyes. And you'll wake up in the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.</p>

<p>"You see," said Aslan. "They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out."</p>
<p>—C. S. Lewis
Until the twentieth century, up to a quarter of all children died from disease—whether through smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, or measles. Today, less than 5 percent of under-five-year-olds die, and the figure is even lower in the developed world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dramatic reduction in infant mortality was brought about not primarily by vaccines but by an even earlier discovery: germ theory.</p>
<p>Before the discovery of germs, most scientists believed diseases were caused by miasma (a bad air or mist) or an invasion of some alien spirit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the nineteenth century that scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and Robert Koch began to show credible evidence that supported the germ theory—the idea that microscopic organisms were the cause of most diseases. Once this theory was adopted, it led to more effective treatments, containment of disease, vaccines, and a subsequent drop in mortality. Today, we forget how rare it was for parents before the twentieth century to see all their children survive to adulthood.</p>
<p>But none of this would have been possible without a significant paradigm shift (metanoia). It was only when a group of scientists looked at the world with different eyes, recalibrated their thinking, and unlearned the old ways that they were able to discover a greater truth.</p>
<p>Our beliefs, our paradigms, and our perceptions not only shape our thinking but also our activity. If we don't understand the danger of germs, we won't wash our hands, sterilize instruments, or sanitize wounds.</p>
<p>As twenty-first-century Western Christians, we have inherited beliefs and mindsets that not only significantly affect how we perceive God, the church, and mission, but also how we function as leaders. To further extend the germ-theory metaphor, we are functioning like surgeons who don't wash their hands, using the same scalpel from the last surgery, oblivious to the</p>
<p>The issue of metanoia deals with the issue of paradigms, paradigm-blindness, and paradigm shifts; and this is why it is critical that we negotiate the rapidly changing VUCA context in which we find ourselves. Unless we engage in metanoia, lasting change will be possible. I (Alan) have seen this firsthand. After years of working with churches and organizations, I have come to the rather unnerving conclusion that it is our faulty paradigms</p>
<p>that are causing us major problems. Take for instance our paradigms in the task of church planting. Because the primary paradigm of church in the West revolves around a peculiarly styled building, designed almost exclusively to host an audience for a Sunday gathering, most “churchplanters” begin their challenging work with this stunted understanding of “church” in mind. And so, instead of planting churches as networks of disciples in communal relationships that exist in and beyond the gathered expression, they opt for a model aligned with their ecclesial mindset. If they are predominantly Reformed or Baptist in their thinking, they end up merely planting pulpits; if they harken from the more charismatic denominations, they plant praise and worship services; and if they are from a high church tradition, they plant eucharist dispensaries. Everything is designed around the somewhat narrowed understanding of what the Sunday-service experience ought to look and feel like. Because these significantly reduced understandings of the New Testament expression of ecclesia tend to dominate the thinking and practices of most church leaders, they seldom stop to consider that the early church itself did not even have distinctive church buildings, let alone pews, stages, vestries, or pulpits. And we wonder why we don’t see the same kind of impact in our churches that was evident throughout the early church, even though it was always marginal and often persecuted. Our understanding of ecclesia is paradigmatically different from theirs.</p>
<p>Our lack of understanding can be caused by a number of factors. Some leaders feel too busy to stop and reflect on the problems with the inherited paradigm; others simply prefer to remain in denial about how dire things really are—we think we have it all figured out. But we need to take another look.</p>
<p>It was the French artist Henri Matisse who said that to look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage;2 that to see an object in all its uniqueness, we must let go of the safety of a familiar view of reality. So, for example, for an artist to truly paint the rose right in front of them, they must forget all the roses that were ever painted.</p>
<p>We suggest this is precisely true when it comes to our deeply entrenched over-familiarity with what we think the church really is. This ability to get another take on reality is a critical dimension of metanoia.</p>
<p>The paradigm problem is exacerbated when people are so deeply invested in the current system—receiving salary, status, and kudos—that they cannot, or will not, call it into question.3 Certainly we know from history that resistance to change does not come from the ignorant masses but rather from the "professionals" who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. The church will not evolve beyond a lecture/worship/performance event, but not without significant metanoia.</p>
<p>It is therefore critical that we gain a biblical understanding of what metanoia is and why it is essential in the life of the believer and the people of God. To help us further unpack the concept of metanoia, we will explore its meaning in both the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<h2>Time to Re/Turn—Old Testament Understandings</h2>
<p>As strange as it might seem, there is no exact Hebrew equivalent for the English term “repentance.” Rather, what we have come to know as repentance is best expressed by several different actions and metaphors that suggest a radical change in thinking and attitude toward God and his world.4 The most prominent Hebrew terms/metaphors come in the words shuv and teshuva, which can best be translated into English as “turning” and “returning,” respectively. To capture the Old Testament essence of the term, we will simply refer to te/shuva as re/turning or re/orienting.</p>
<p>As the word suggests, re/turning signifies a reorientation of perspective, like when you turn around and proceed in a different direction. It involves a reversal, conversion, and reorientation that is often felt before it is fully understood. It is grounded in the work of God to restore all things—including the self.5 Re/turning clearly points to the re/direction of life, a re/turning toward God, a right relationship with him. The ancient rabbis taught that it was one of the seven pillars on which God established the world, suggesting that re/turning was built into the "operating system" of the universe itself.</p>
<p>Te/shuva, like all genuinely biblical ideas, is grounded in the reality of the covenant between God and his people. This covenant involved a commitment to worship and serve the One God, along with a willingness to be increasingly attuned to his will. The Israelites had to constantly re/turn to maintain their relationship with YHWH. This meant a continuing process of letting go of things that interfered with their connection with God, things that not only distracted them but also distorted their experience of God. Because the Israelites (like us today) were natural sinners and therefore inclined to covenantal unfaithfulness, the phenomenon of constant re/turning was factored into the covenant relationship that Israel had with God. It was the only way a relationship with the holy God could be maintained.</p>
<p>The concept of re/turning also assumes we are not always inclined to make the right choices; sometimes we deliberately take paths that lead us astray, and at other times we simply lose our way for lack of direction. We are all on a journey, and our choices have consequences, good or bad. Therefore, we all need regular course corrections.</p>
<p>We all want to progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place you want to be. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case [the person] who turns back soonest is the most progressive. There is nothing progressive about being pig-headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world, it is pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistakes. We are on the wrong road. And if that is so,</p>
<p>More often than not, instead of re/turning, we find ways to minimize or ignore our "mistakes." Embarrassed about our faults and indirection, we tend to justify these "mistakes" with Christian platitudes that focus on the positive while ignoring the harm we have brought to ourselves, to others, or to the purposes God has called us to.</p>
<h2>A Time to Tune In—New Testament Understandings</h2>
<p>If the Old Testament notion of repentance encompasses the idea of re/turning, then the New Testament one points to the idea of tuning in.</p>
<p>The New Testament fully incorporates the Old Testament’s te/shuva but develops it by focusing on the role of conversion as not only changing our direction but also transforming us in the process—in other words it is metamorphic. The New Testament consistently teaches that repentance changes the way we perceive and make sense of our world—a change that goes to the very heart of consciousness. And here we arrive at the New Testament concept of metanoia, upon which this book is centered.</p>
<p>The word metanoia is typically translated in the Bible as "repentance." But this is not a particularly accurate or comprehensive translation. This diminished understanding of the biblical concept of repentance stems from the fact that Jerome, in translating the Bible into Latin, rendered metanoia into the Latin word poenitentia, thus limiting its meaning to feelings of remorse and regret. This translation carries strong personal overtones, and so when we hear the word "repent," we tend to think of it as something we can engage in some form of restitution by actively trying to change and make amends. While it is important to feel some level of remorse in relation to our sins, as well as some form of contrition, this reductionistic understanding does not actually convey what is meant by the word metanoia.</p>
<p>Consider instead Alister Mc Grath’s take:</p>
<p>The Greek term metanoia—traditionally and inadequately translated as
“repentance”—means something more like “a radical change of mind,”
or “a fundamental intellectual re-orientation,” through which we turn
thinking and living. Repentance means not primarily a sense of regret,
large enough for God’s mystery. It is about a transformed metaphysical</p>
<p>A renunciation of small-minded thinking along with a transformed vision of reality! And if this sounds over the top, what Mc Grath is asserting is clear in the linguistic structure (etymology) of the word itself. Look at the prefix meta in other words: metamorphosis (change into something completely different); metaverse (a virtual world where people can experience things like they would in the real world); or metaphysics (the study of what is "above," or "overarching." Used as a prefix it means "more comprehensive" or "beyond," suggesting an opening up to something at a higher level of reality.</p>
<p>The second part of the word is noia, which is derived from the Greek</p>
<p>word nous. In the New Testament, it refers to a person or society’s outlook, mental filter, orientation, or mindset. The nous is made up of a complex system of narratives, assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them.</p>
<p>It is a “way of thinking” or a paradigm.12 “[It] is the whole group of faculties which compose intelligence: It is sight and perception, thought and reflection, apprehension and comprehension—all that is popularly known as the intellect or understanding. But it also embraces more than this, namely, a large portion of the moral and affectional nature. It occupies the realm of the heart.”13</p>
<p>Taken together, we believe the best translation of meta-noia is simply
“paradigm shift”—or perhaps more colloquially, the experience of having
your mind blown. Using the more disciplined language of the scholar,
undergoing metanoia experiences the inception of a new, ultimate, and
ously known: “Metanoia can be defined as being either ‘another mind’ or</p>
<p>Clearly, metanoia is a much broader concept than the standard
reduced mistranslation of repentance conveys. As theologian Richard
Niebuhr observes, “The Christian responsibility ‘to repent’ demands more
vague desire for reform. [Rather,] it involves the recognition and rejection
metanoia always brings with it a corresponding transformation. Metanoia
him, deep gratitude, and a growth in self-awareness that increases our
as well as for faithful living in the kingdom.16 Crucially, as we will explore</p>
<p>All in all, metanoia is something like the red pill in the 1999 film The Matrix.17 Take it and everything changes; you wake up in a new world.</p>
<p>And importantly, with regards to our various VUCA situations, we
believe that when individuals and organizations embrace metanoia, it
increases their ability to adapt, to mature, to persevere, and to be resilient
hopeful and innovative people in the midst of trials. (Much more of this in
this gift, nor have we meaningfully appropriated it in our individual and
has been significantly closed; our spiritual instincts have been suppressed
the ever-greater God has been severely impaired.
Far from the stereotypical negative perception of repentance, which</p>
<p>leaves us feeling diminished and ashamed, it is time for us to see metanoia as
of our current condition and opens us up to an ever-greater, multi-dimen-</p>
<p>Correctly understood, repentance is not negative, but positive. It means,
whole life on the Trinity. It is to look, not backward with regret, but
upwards at God’s love. It is to see, not merely what we have failed to be,
we see. To repent is to open our eyes to the light.18
In the rest of this chapter, we want to highlight the many dimensions of</p>
<p>metanoia and how it can bring about fruitful change in both our lives and</p>
<h2>Metanoia as a Mind-Blowing Transformation of Understanding</h2>
<p>The first sentence in Jesus’ active ministry could have included any number of topics. He would later give us the Great Commandments and the Great Commission, teach the Sermon on the Mount, engage in Upper Room Discourse, and pray a high priestly prayer for the unity of his church. But those weren’t the focus of his first words. Instead, he announced, “The time has come … the kingdom of God has come near. Metanoiete and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15). The lesson? To even be able to hear and understand the most profound truths that Jesus teaches, we must first open our minds and hearts and undergo metanoia. It’s the doorway to a real experience of God.</p>
<p>We encounter the Lord Jesus, and he immediately invites us to
fundamental transformation—to metanoia! To know God is to change.</p>
<p>Therefore, the true following of Jesus (discipleship) is marked by a</p>
<p>significant reorientation that involves centering our whole being around the reality of God. Metanoia is the doorway to the spiritual revolution of Jesus. It allows us to discover that God is not “out there” but that we are in God and God is in us. And because we have been united to God in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ, the source of all reality, we no longer look out at reality; we now look out from reality. That’s what it means to have the mind of Christ—the place where everything changes.</p>
<p>Stuart Devenish has conducted exhaustive study on the idea of
conversion, and says that authentic metanoia—because it integrates the
biblically related dimensions of a radical re/orienting of life, together
disciples with a whole new way of processing their lives and negotiating
Paul’s conversion when scales fell from his eyes (Acts 9:18), the convert
and unrecognized dimensions of reality.”20
We can perhaps now better understand what Paul means when he</p>
<p>admonishes all believers to be constantly “transformed by the renewing of
mational experience will gain a renewed way of understanding themselves,
values is also thoroughly reevaluated. Metanoia allows us to experience
customs, attitudes, or ideas; something that sparks a deeper connection
our own role in the world; and offers a deepened perspective on things.</p>
<p>Theologian Bernard Lonergan says that this new way of seeing the world involves what he calls a “horizon change” or a “paradigm shift.”22 In that revelatory moment, we are literally seized by a “way,” a vision, and we begin to experience our lives as meaningful through serving the new construct.</p>
<p>Everything, including our mental maps and core commitments, are reordered as a result. Metanoia therefore involves the capacity to imagine new possibilities—the idea of an open and invigorated imagination. It is much more than a confession of personal guilt or doing penance!</p>
<p>Likewise, theologians such as von Balthasar and Heschel see
conversion as being awakened to wonder, even though this wonder
is usually somewhat contained at first. The full implications of our
for us to grasp in one go, and we need time to assimilate what it is that
a single momentous and permanent change but also a process spread out
teaches that sanctification is both instantaneous as well as ongoing, as</p>
<p>We are both “saved” in a moment in time, but we are also called to “work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12). This twin nature of conversion is counter to much of Western evangelicalism, which places undue emphasis on conversion as a one-time, momentary decision. Our language reflects this viewpoint, with phrases such as “Get ’em saved,” and “If you died tonight, do you know where you would go?</p>
<p>Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus.” But conversion, as Eugene Peterson puts it, is also a long obedience in the same direction.24 We never stop learning; genuine learning involves a prolonged process that will occupy a whole lifetime. This is the essence of discipleship.</p>
<p>Metanoia is powerful because the smallest realization and new
discovery can lead to new habits, patterns, and ways of relating to the
world. Breakthrough thinker Olivia Fox Cabane notes that “break-
lens through which you view the world has been suddenly, gloriously
understanding that moves you past a barrier and makes you see things,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these moments can be all too rare. But this ought not to
be so! Openness to ongoing metanoia ought to characterize the life of all
people committed to loving, worshipping, and serving the ever-greater God.</p>
<h2>Metanoia as an Ever-Expansive Reframing of Reality</h2>
<p>As humans, we have the propensity to be bound by ideologies (reduced truth that claims to be the only defining truth) and by idolatries (reductions in our understanding of God, of making God small) that claim our allegiance. The only way to be released from such ideologies and idolatries is to reevaluate them in light of a greater truth.26 Metanoia involves a transformational cleansing of perception, which enables a new, expansive, way of viewing the world.27 It is therefore essential for ongoing transformation and the growth in all knowledge, especially when it comes to experiencing the God who is ever greater.</p>
<p>If we fail to engage with conversion as an ongoing reality, we will
always remain somewhat misdirected and distracted, distanced from
God, and therefore unable to experience the spiritually intimate relati-
metanoia in principle, we are no longer able to recognize the ever-
to show us. Maturity (telos), fullness (pleroma), and the ever-expansive
do so.</p>
<h2>Metanoia as a Crack in Your Cosmic Egg</h2>
<p>Metanoia brings with it paradigmatic insight and learning that is characteristic of breakthrough moments—those “Eureka!” experiences that seem to radically reorient our lives and trajectories. Consider, for example, creative philosopher Joseph Chilton Pearce’s description of the creative process itself as an experience of becoming aware of a crack in our seemingly self-contained worldview (what he likens to an “egg”) that eventually leads to a paradigm change at a certain point in time. His own story is one that many of us can relate to.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing since I was old enough to read, and I have always
around with it for a few days or weeks or months (and in one case

was still pregnant with the concept but not yet birthing. I discovered in
we become aware of the egg, and then a small crack in it, and then—by
enough that the light of understanding flows in and it’s all just so clear</p>
<p>My (Alan) own experiences are eerily similar. For instance, my book The
Forgotten Ways started as a quest to understand the intrinsic nature of
movements that was initiated by hearing a question that utterly gripped
the church in our time. For the next three years, every day, I sought to find
conversations with others, and concentrated reflection. Throughout this
“answer” to my quest—the “cracking of my cosmic egg,” so to speak—
“answer” came in what I experienced as an “Aha!” moment, a revelation,
in a teacup.30
One of the characteristic features of metanoic experience is that, by</p>
<p>and large, it is experienced with the force of a conversion. Although the
catalytic moment of realization as their significance dawns upon a person

<p>We tend to retreat from metanoia, imagining it to be a miserable
process of highlighting our failures and shameful acts, but the process of
metanoia allows us to see with fresh eyes the beauty awaiting us if we turn
experiencing epidemic levels of anxiety, discouragement, and frustration,
to re/turn, re/orient, and re/tune to experience the full and abundant life</p>
