<h1>Chapter 1: The Apocalypse of the (Ecclesial) Soul: Glimpses into the Problems and Potentials of the Church</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The movement is natural, arising spontaneously. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.</p>
<p>—I Ching</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These are moments in life that can be ripe for change and transformation—if we haven't yet, we will someday: illness, the failure of a business, the loss of a loved one, the end of a relationship, betrayal. As in the Covid lockdown, those moments generate a liminal space, a threshold moment for profound transformation.</p>
<p>—Pope Francis</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See, I am doing a new thing. Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?</p>
<p>—Isaiah 43:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past decade, our world has experienced something epochal.</p>
<p>Commentator Andy Crouch famously described it as a "cultural ice age"—an era that will usher in a lasting shift in our ways of thinking and acting throughout the domains of society.1 It's hard to argue with this assertion; most of us instinctively know that something fundamental has changed, but we are not yet sure of its consequences. The dangerous ideological fractures in recent US politics, the seismic shifts in geopolitical power, the impact of the global pandemic—all exacerbated by the ever-encroaching realities of an inescapable environmental crisis and the advance of artificial intelligence—have all contributed to this particularly fraught moment in time. The cultural madness and ideological warfare that recent events have exposed are nothing short of alarming. How did so-called "civilization" arrive at the cusp of a new cold war that threatens to get so hot that it engulfs us all? Have we not learned anything from the precipitous events of the twentieth century, the deadliest century in recorded history?</p>
<p>For these, and many more reasons, the use of the biblical term "apocalyptic" is entirely fitting. The word apocalypsis in the Greek literally means to expose, to unveil, or to reveal something previously unknown, previously hidden. In our context, it refers to the exposure of previously hidden patterns in corporate human culture that are so deep that they hide in plain sight and replicate themselves indefinitely without our conscious awareness.</p>
<p>In the Scriptures, events such as these are also called "kairos moments"—saturated time, opportune moments when God calls people to account, and ultimately to repentance … to metanoia.3</p>
<p>"The time [kairos] has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Repent [metanoiete] and believe the good news!"</p>
<p>Metanoia has always been fundamental to our life as Christ-followers.</p>
<p>When Jesus began his earthly ministry and invited people to follow him and encounter the kingdom of God, there was simply one condition: metanoia, or, as we have narrowly and inadequately translated it, "repentance." We will more fully explore the meaning of the word in subsequent chapters, but for now, it is enough to say that the word meta simply means beyond, above, or overarching. And the word noia (a derivative of the noun nous) refers to a way of thinking. Metanoia therefore involves paradigm shift, the recognition and rejection of various false frameworks for understanding the world itself and waking up to a whole new world in which Christ is Lord and King.</p>
<p>Examples of the call to metanoia abound throughout the Scriptures.</p>
<p>A disquieting example is found in the book of Revelation, where Jesus confronts the various churches directly and calls them to repent of their sins, disloyalties, small-mindedness, and cold-heartedness (Revelation 2, 3). He warns them that if they don't "metanoia," he himself will remove their lampstand as an act of sovereign judgment.4</p>
<p>But because this is part of biblical revelation, it's not just about "them"; it is about "us" as well. As an authentic expression of the prophetic function, the apocalyptic visions in the book of Revelation are not to be read as a mere prediction of world history but rather as a depiction of the ever-new intersection of the kingdom of God with the kingdoms of this world.</p>
<p>Prophecy here, of course, does not mean foretelling the future but rather forth-telling—knowing what God's righteousness demands in any particular instant; knowing how, from the standpoint of God, to assign to things and to people their proper place in the overall pattern. The tangled threads of time are unravelled, and "the revelation" comes. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic—without doubt the most disruptive event for the church since World War II—provided a revelatory experience whereby the hidden and unconscious ecclesial system was laid bare, forcing church leaders across the Western world to re-evaluate the long-held belief (and practice) that the church exists primarily in its once-a-week expression. Our reliance on fragile practices was "apocalypsed." This in turn has stimulated many to reflect apostolically on the church as a distributed, incarnational, network—the classic signature of transformative movements that change the world. Despite the painful disruption the crisis brought to many, it appears God has nonetheless used it to compel church leaders to reflect on the assumptions on which their prevailing expressions of church were built and to explore more adaptive, fluid, and non-fragile expressions of ecclesia. God has given us all an opportunity to investigate the system, to discern the numerous fault lines, to repent of our reductionisms (heresies), to recognize our fragilities, and to align ourselves more faithfully to him and to his purposes.</p>
<p>If we don't take this opportunity as it presents itself to us now, in our own kairos God-moment, we fear we will be doomed to a deepening frustration with defunct forms of church and an ongoing existential crisis in relationship to our faithfulness to Jesus and his kingdom way.7</p>
<h2>Never Waste a Krisis</h2>
<p>Although this revelatory kairos moment is disruptive and presents demanding adaptive challenges, as believers we must recognize that the sovereign Lord of history is somehow at work. Throughout the Bible, history cannot be viewed as a neutral process or as mere fate but, rather, can only be rightly understood as the theater of God's sovereign actions and judgments in the human realm. God is always deeply involved in world events, albeit in profoundly mysterious ways. If we are to believe the biblical testimony to God's sovereignty in world affairs, we must not dodge the implication that not only the world as a whole, but also we as his people, are being collectively weighed in the balance. We are being tried and tested. We are told that judgment begins with the household of God (1 Peter 4:17), and so we ought not to be surprised but rather seek to discern what God is saying. We must always respond by interrogating our systems and our roles within them: What is God saying to us in these portentous events? What is being revealed about us in this crisis? What must change? What specifically does God require of me/us?</p>
<p>Addressing and responding to questions such as these will help us faithfully engage with our kairos moment and God's call to metanoia—to change the way we think and act.</p>
<p>Truly, it seems that we have come to a point of "crisis"—a word which Webster's dictionary defines as "the point of time when it is to be decided whether any affair or course of action must go on, or be modified, or terminate; the decisive moment; the turning point."8 This definition suggests that crises determine events. In other words, we, as the church of Jesus, should embrace crisis as an opportunity for change and growth—both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>This krisis for the church is multifaceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a spiritual crisis. There is a pandemic of fear and anxiety, and the church has not adequately equipped people to handle it. This alone is cause for much repentance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a missiological crisis. The church's credibility and witness before a watching world has been compromised. Our corporate inability to effectively reach the world is painfully evident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a theological crisis. We are forced to take a serious look at our understanding of God and how it relates to the world. It is time for us to repent of our various idolatries and false conceptions of God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is an ecclesiological crisis. A fragile, unfaithful, and ineffective expression of church has been revealed. We need to return to our core, misguided paradigm and redesign from there. The church lacks clarity on the nature of Jesus and the centrality of his mission. We must correct any fundamental misalignments and acknowledge that it is always re-Jesus time,9 but particularly so at present. Failure here would be catastrophic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We must do something about these crises.</p>
<p>If we fail to respond faithfully to our particular kairos moment, then we effectively abdicate our responsibility before God to ensure our lives and our organizations are correctly aligned with Jesus and his mission in the world. This will result in ongoing frustration and despair—like Sisyphus, doomed to endlessly push a boulder up a hill only to watch it roll back down.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it's like the storyline of the classic 1993 movie Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray plays a somewhat narcissistic and self-centered weatherman who is forced to live through the same day repeatedly until he learns the lessons of perseverance. Only when he finally learns the lessons of his kairos moment, his metanoia moment, is he freed from the time loop in which he has been trapped.10</p>
<p>This is not only a powerful parable for individuals who can't seem to break free of addictive behaviors but also for churches and organizational systems that find themselves in loops that seem impossible to escape. If we fail to make the necessary changes now—if we don't embrace metanoia—then we are not only foolish, they are plain unfaithful.</p>
<p>This is clearly a problem with more liturgical ("high") churches that simply try to repeat past successes, but perhaps it also explains why many evangelical churches are still trying to replicate the revivalism that occurred in the late nineteenth century or why many churches are still stuck in the models of the '80s. It's like they are stuck in their own version of Groundhog Day.</p>
<p>What is the lesson they must learn to escape the loop? Have they even bothered to ask?</p>
<p>Without metanoia we will continue in our various loops of despair and incompetence, either until we eventually learn, or until our organizations simply disappear in the rubble of history. Ever wonder how many churches and organizations have disappeared because they were stuck in their own time loops?</p>
<p>Like Israel, many of us find ourselves wanting to go back to Egypt rather than experience the challenges of the desert. But it's no good continuing to do the same things and expecting different findings. In this unique cultural moment, God is revealing things to us so that we might see clearly. The only appropriate response to the issues arising from our broken paradigms is to repent, or—in the language of this book—to embrace metanoia. This book will explore how we as leaders can help people and organizations enter into this process of metanoia and discover what God is calling us to repent of.</p>
<h2>It's VUCA, You Schmooka!</h2>
<p>Viewing our current times apocalyptically—as an exposure or unveiling of what was previously hidden—provides us with a uniquely theological form of knowledge. This is critical in helping God's people understand and respond to the various revelatory moments he puts before us and to which we are called to faithfully respond.</p>
<p>The social sciences also propose some compelling lenses which highlight the need for radical metanoic change. For instance, a well-developed sociological framework is expressed in the acronym VUCA, which stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity.</p>
<p>These terms accurately portray the situation of constant, unpredictable change that is increasingly the norm throughout all societies, cultures, and economies in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volatility refers to the speed of change in a cultural setting. The faster things change, the more volatile the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty refers to the extent to which we can confidently predict future events or understand what is going on. The more uncertain the world is, the harder it is to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity refers to the number of factors we need to take into account when making decisions. In situations of high complexity, it is impossible to fully analyze all the variables. The more complex the world is, the harder it is to analyze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ambiguity refers to the lack of clarity about what something means or how to interpret something. A situation is ambiguous, for example, when information can be interpreted in multiple ways, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. The more ambiguous the world is, the harder it is to make sense of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When these factors combine, as they do in our day, they present a real threat to the societies that are experiencing them—as well as a compelling opportunity for revolutionary change. However, this VUCA world also presents significant challenges for organizations trying to negotiate such contexts. This rapidly changing situation demands a more adaptive and responsive approach.</p>
<p>The problem is that the reductionist formulations of church and organization we have inherited are derived from a significantly different, and less missionally challenging, context than that of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The maps no longer fit the territories and, even more importantly, they do not fully square with the New Testament itself. As a result, we have a serious systemic, paradigmatic issue. We are wise to heed the words of Peter Drucker here—that the greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence itself; it is to act with yesterday's logic.12</p>
<p>This problem with trying to negotiate today's challenges with yesterday's logic is all too real. For instance, in my [Alan] work in helping people grapple with the nature of church-as-movement, I have found that many leaders simply cannot get their heads around the "new" ideas of missional movement. (Such ideas are actually ancient but appear new to us.) The old ideas are so deeply entrenched in the collective rationality and rooted in the Christendom paradigm that we continue to use them even though we know they are inadequate to contain the new wine (Luke 5:39).</p>
<p>Although we no longer live in Christendom (the form of church birthed out of the Constantinian marriage of church and state), it appears, when it comes to thinking about the church, that Constantine is still the emperor of our imaginations. A profoundly non-missional paradigm therefore continues to hold the Western church firmly in its grip. To escape the innumerable traps of yesterday's logic enshrined in the Christendom paradigm, and to faithfully negotiate the new territories we find ourselves in, will require metanoia—there can be no dodging it.</p>
<p>To be clear here, we are not criticizing those who work tirelessly on the frontlines of the church. The problem runs far deeper than the average disciple or leader—it is a collective problem in which we all participate. If soldiers are sent to fight a war with inadequate weapons, we can't necessarily fault the soldiers who fought there, but we can blame the generals who sent them into battle in the first place. Similarly, if a child is facing psychological problems because of a toxic culture (e.g., the beauty myth), the problem is not just a problem inside the child; it is also a problem in the culture itself.</p>
<p>Lasting change only takes place when the ideas that created the problems themselves are changed. It's therefore essential to address the inherited concepts that infuse our thinking and our subsequent habits. We need to see things differently. And for this we are going to need the grace of both individual and collective metanoia.</p>
<h2>Toward Promise and Prize</h2>
<p>The good news is that apocalypse is not all doom and gloom. The apocalyptic moment not only presents a threat but, as Albert Einstein said, "In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity." Similarly, in Chinese script, the word "crisis" can mean either danger or opportunity, depending on context. This is more than a linguistic cue; it is true to life itself because crises nearly always lead to great change. Of course, there is always the possibility that the change will be for the worse. But there is also the opportunity to change for the better—to reform and improve. Likewise, the apocalyptic moment reveals our flaws, our sins, and our indirection, but it also comes with a promise for those who overcome. Metanoia not only enables ongoing faithfulness to God and our respective callings, but it also brings about a renewed sense of clarity about the situation and our role in it. And, because it inevitably involves some form of recalibration, it also ushers in promised new insight, a defining prize … missional impact.</p>
<p>We will explore this more fully in the next chapter, but at this point it is worth noting that there are many positive outcomes of metanoia. For one, it involves a transformational cleansing of perception—it allows us to see things as they really are and opens up a new mental map of the world, the very thing we need in times of crisis. It also involves the growth in all knowledge—especially knowledge of the eternal God. It enables us to see God more clearly, to understand his ways more deeply, and to align ourselves more fully with his purposes.</p>
<p>Therefore, for those willing to undergo the paradigm shift metanoia brings, the crisis unlocks possibilities and prizes previously unknown and unseen. For example, the crisis of the pandemic forced the church to rediscover its distributed, incarnational nature—the church scattered among the people (Acts 11:19–24). Ironic indeed because this is precisely what Jesus commanded in the Great Commission (Matt. 28:16–20). The pandemic offered a perfect opportunity to live into our calling as a faithful diaspora (as described in the book of Hebrews). I (Alan) heard a leader of a large church say that the pandemic was not about closing down (as many of his peers were lamenting) but rather that the church was finally being released. This leader saw the situation not as a threat but as an opportunity, and because of this was able to help his people who are open-minded enough to discern God's hand in contemporary events and who are willing to adapt amid disruptive conditions.</p>
<p>No less than the great theologian Karl Barth fully recognized this idea of crisis as opportunity when he gave guidance to an anxious church in Germany after World War II. The Lutheran church—which was now radically decentered, delegitimized, and stripped of its privileged position—was asking how the church could possibly continue to exist as they had always understood it. In other words, he was struggling with the issue of whether the church (as it had been structured, dependent on buildings, seminaries, and state funding) could possibly operate in the new context. In light of the demise of Christendom across the West, all of God's people, not just Lutherans, must ask this question of themselves and in every case render a clear answer of yes or no. He answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, the church's existence does not always have to possess the same form. The form of the Christian Church is to serve with her witness, is not unconditionally bound to a specific form. Yes, the hour may strike, and perhaps has already struck, when God himself will put an end to this mode of existence because it lacks integrity. We must be willing to let go of our dependency on that mode of existence even while it still lasts. Indeed, on the contrary, we must look about us for new ventures in new directions. If we are attentive, God will show us such new ways as we can hardly anticipate and will give us unconquerable security for ourselves through him. For his name is "I am that I am."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we lose our way in complex times, the God-given grace of metanoia helps us correct our direction and jettison obsolete practices, enabling us to be courageous enough to walk a different way and to innovate.</p>
<p>Rather than feeling ashamed of losing our way from God, metanoia is an Invitation to turn in a different direction, to draw closer to God and renew our commitment to the mission of the ever-greater God we love, serve, and follow.</p>
<p>There is simply no way of short-circuiting ongoing repentance in a life of faith. We are wise to understand it and to practice it as we negotiate life and God faithfully. This book will go on to explore this in depth and to show the incredible benefits that metanoia brings.</p>
