<h1>Chapter 3: Why We Need to Repent: A Compelling Rationale for Metanoia</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Each wrong idea we follow is a crime committed against future generations.</p>
<p>A change of worldview can change the world viewed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book A Guide for the Perplexed, philosopher E. F. Schumacher talks about visiting Stalingrad in the communist era of the USSR. He was taken on a tour of what is now called St. Petersburg, and at a certain point was standing, he could see several enormous cathedrals and churches, and asked why this was the case, and he was informed that in the USSR, churches were eliminated from public consciousness; they were deliberately excluded not just from maps but from awareness itself.</p>
<p>Schumacher uses this incident as a metaphor to represent the modern atheistic/materialist worldview. He asks his readers what has been deliberately excluded from their mental maps, their inherited paradigms, and challenges them to look with fresh eyes—to see what they are not now seeing—and challenges them to redraw their maps. In other words, he invites his readers to experience metanoia by</p>
<p>This is the hard work we too must engage in if we are to allow God to reshape and realign our personal and collective expressions of faith.</p>
<p>Speaking of mental maps, perhaps the greatest obstacle to charting a viable way forward is the illusion that our current understandings are the right place to start a journey to a more faithful future. Or, as Charlie Munger asks, "What is the hardest thing to get in the human mind?" Epictetus, the Greek philosopher, once noted that it is the closed-minded, non-metanoic mind that refuses new insights and means that better ways of doing things will forever remain unexplored. I (Alan) have long held that if paradigm change does not occur, it is impossible for a fundamental shift to take place in either the individual or the organization. Without metanoia, we cannot experience a renewed sense of orientation and direction. Re/newed here does not imply simply updating the old, but rather fundamentally transforming the church's most primal way of conceiving and negotiating our world—our paradigm.</p>
<p>As we have noted in the preceding chapters, we simply must come to grips with the various dimensions of conversion if we are to recalibrate the church, restore spiritual integrity, and repair the broken fabric of our collective life. Only through metanoia can we experience the radical, system-wide, Spirit-generated paradigm shift we so evidently need at this particular apocalyptic moment. In this chapter we will explore why metanoia is so critical—perhaps now more than ever?</p>
<h2>Because We Generally Suck at It</h2>
<p>I (Alan) once had a vigorous conversation with an old friend who also happened to be one of Europe’s leading missiologists. We were talking about the seeming inability of the European church to shift its thinking and practice, especially in light of radical changes in the cultural context.</p>
<p>Because the majority of European churches were designed and calibrated toward previous historic eras and situations, they were not able to respond to the challenges of contemporary mission. As a result, many now exist largely as monuments to a totally different time. This inability to adapt and respond faithfully to today’s issues has resulted in the significant decline (and often closure) of European churches. This is not an overstatement. Current statistics indicate we are likely seeing the last generation of biblical forms of Christianity in many European countries.3</p>
<p>As part of the same conversation, I lamented the long, shameful
history of violent and oppressive antisemitism that is associated with
European Christendom. As a Jew of European descent, this is of parti-
be bound up with an inability to confess, repent, and so be released from
not fathom the idea of whole churches and/or denominations repenting.</p>
<p>He viewed repentance as only for individuals. Asimilar resistance to collective repentance can be witnessed in the US, as the nation—as well as its churches—try to jump over their own dark shadows when it comes to systemic racism and nationalistic ideologies. This inability to recognize ancestral sins and collective responsibility before God might well account for the loss of spiritual authority, as well as much of the decline of the church, in these contexts.</p>
<p>If the church is itself unwilling to repent, how can it possibly call
broader society to the kind of change that a living relationship with God
demands? Is not the gospel itself predicated on the call to metanoia?</p>
<p>H. R. Niebuhr suggests that the church ought to be the very first to repent for the sins of a society, and that it is to repent on behalf of all. In this way, we become something of a prefigurative community that embodies a prophetic call to repentance in society at large.</p>

<p>It might surprise us to learn that, throughout Scripture, the call to repen-
tance (te/shuva and metanoia) is addressed mainly to corporate entities...
to whole nations, such as Israel, Nineveh, and Egypt; and to Jesus’ church.5</p>
<p>This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem: “Plow

give people a free pass to sin against the holy God.
It might well be that our collective sins are greater and more serious</p>
<p>than our individual sins—a negative synergy at work on the collective</p>
<p>Gang rape and mass murder are extreme examples, but think also of the countless ways we each contribute to the destruction of the earth, to global poverty, and to the shameful oppression of women.9 Abuses and injustices we’d be mortified to commit on our own are normalized within our cultural milieu, allowing us to “benefit” from a society that lives in resistance to God’s ways and perpetuates evil against his image bearers.</p>
<p>Because it happens at such a grand scale, we, as individuals, are convinced we are not responsible, even though we are part of the collective. It seems we still have much to learn about what it means to keep covenant with the holy God.10 We must repent!</p>
<h2>Because any Advance in Our Knowledge of God Requires Repentance</h2>
<p>If we truly believe God is transcendent, eternal, and infinite—and we as humans are not—then any move toward him will require a radical opening of the mind and heart.</p>
<p>God’s revelation always shatters our preconceptions and exposes
God’s infinite nature. The divine name YHWH (“I will be as I will be” or
“I will appear as I will appear”) indicates that God is always surprising

<p>The alternative to the metanoic mind is a fearful mind which resists

<h2>Because if We Fall in Love With Our System, We Lose the Capacity to Change It</h2>
<p>It was Upton Sinclair who once noted that it is difficult to get someone to
tanding it.15 This startling idea highlights how certain people become
their adherents/employees. Change becomes difficult precisely because
even if all else in the system is visibly suffering.16
Over the years, we have trained leaders embedded in different</p>
<p>Christian institutions and churches who wanted to see change. Regularly
lack the skill to bring about change within the institution itself. Leading

say, “To honor the tradition does not excuse one from the obligation of

This is particularly significant in relation to our understandings of the</p>

next experience of God is often the last experience of God, because we
get locked into it. Much angst, burn-out, missional ineffectiveness, and spiritual apathy comes from expecting God to fit into preconstructed boxes and mental frames. To avoid being trapped in these various prisons, we must engage in regular paradigm shift... regular metanoia. Become a drifter every now and again, hit the road, take a trip to yet another way of experiencing God’s reality and presence. Repent!</p>
<h2>Because We Can't Lug It All Along With Us</h2>
<p>It might seem obvious at first, but no matter how much you want to honor your organizational tradition, you simply can't do everything your predecessors or ancestors did. It's impossible. And yet most churches (and individuals) feel somehow obligated to repeat past formulas and successes in order to be faithful to Jesus today. Now don't hear what we are not saying; we fully recognize that in a faith community, tradition can represent the collective memory of our best thinking and practice and is therefore an important source of insight and instruction. But we must remember that tradition is not in itself authoritative. Only Scripture—as the canonical source of God's Word, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and prayerfully interpreted in and by the community of faith—holds this kind of authoritative value.23</p>
<p>Whereas tradition is usually positive, traditionalism is almost always
not. Tradition is important because it connects us to a historically rooted
“way” and confers upon us the wisdom of the past. Traditionalism, on the

<h2>Because We Need to Redraw the Maps to Fit the New Territories</h2>
<p>The metaphor of maps is useful in grappling with the concept of metanoia.</p>
<p>Charles Taylor calls the inherited mapping embedded in culture “social imaginary.” These inherited cultural maps determine the way in which we seek to maintain the society in which we live.28 We are all born into and shaped by a cultural world that has deeply ingrained mental maps about how the world works and how we are to function within it.29</p>
<p>As author Len Hjalmarson notes, humans develop mental maps as
aids in orienting a complex world. They act as a kind of shorthand, so
that we can pay attention to other things. They become the implicit lenses</p>
<p>Peter Senge notes that,</p>
<p>“Mental models” are deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or

<p>Most of our maps are updated in small increments, but sometimes our
maps are redrawn wholesale; and when this happens, we experience
something like a conversion. The entire map is rewritten, and any</p>
<p>This map metaphor is powerful because it has become clear that the
church’s current mental maps—the prevailing social imaginary we use to
maintain life and culture—no longer fit the territories in which we live.</p>
<p>Most of our thinking about ourselves and our collective role in the world has been formulated in different times and places. For many Christians and Christian denominations/organizations, this means in effect that they are trying to negotiate twenty-first-century New York with a map of sixteenth-century London, Rome, or Geneva—depending on the denominational bent.32</p>
<p>The world evolves, conditions change, and new norms emerge. But
instead of adapting, people find themselves stuck in their patterns of
thinking and behaving. Most don’t realize the new situational reality until
and cultural shifts. As Adam Grant reminds us, part of the problem is</p>
<p>Some psychologists point out that we’re mental misers: we often prefer

<p>We need to be able to meta-think, to experience paradigm shift. To insist
on adhering to obsolete paradigms is not only very foolish, but it is also
ungodly—because it effectively excludes an openness to the Spirit, who

<p>This is as good a metaphor for repentance as any. Repentance—involving conversion/redirection and meta-thinking—is just like rebooting the system. Repentance resets the ecclesial system to the basic theological algorithms and enables us to refresh and realign everything, bringing tangible hope for a more faithful future.</p>
<p>Most machines—whether computers, smart phones, or cars—will
need recalibrating (a tune-up) from time to time. The same applies to
humans and institutions, both of which experience various forms of
the church as with any institution. Although most people and organi-
the “what” and “how” are repeated, entities begin to focus on processes
a certain way without thinking, the harder it becomes to stand back,</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a crisis to shock us into this; the benefit of the unique crisis we are currently in is that it has also given us the time and space to actively engage in this reset.</p>
<p>Put simply, recalibration is about ensuring there is alignment between
a person or organization and their fundamental, defining values. It is
about making sure that what you are doing and how you are doing it lines
particularly appealing or spectacular work, but it is critically important
when compounded over time.

We need to repent!</p>
<h2>Because in Order to Learn, We Must First Unlearn</h2>
<p>At the opening of thebook 5Q, which focuses on the fivefold typology of the ministry of the biblical church, I (Alan) felt it important to encourage the reader to engage with metanoia. This is because the predotypology of ministry has been significantly reduced from that of the New Testament understanding of ministry. Without a metanoic openness to looking again at what has become too familiar (“soft eyes”), there is no way of escaping the old baked-in patterns that we have found ourselves locked into. Metanoia—involving as it does unlearning, reframing, and recalibrating—is the price we must pay to experience transformation. It changes how we see and experience God, people, the world, mission, and of course, the ministry of the church.</p>
<p>But the desire, as well as the ability, to see things in their original
wholeness exacts a price on those who find themselves captive to
reductionisms of various sorts and varieties. The price of admission to
repentance is the price required for any new learning in any domain—
church it’s called repentance. No one can learn who is not first prepared

open-minded, and to learn again. It is beyond the scope of this book to

We all know a variation of the folktale of the two con men who arrive</p>
<p>at the capital city of an emperor who loves to spend lavishly on clothing.</p>
<p>Posing as weavers, they offer to make him magnificent clothes that are visible only to those who are wise. The emperor hires them, and they begin their work. Various officials, and then the emperor himself, visit them to check their progress. Although each of them can see that the looms are empty, they pretend otherwise, lest they be considered fools. When the weavers report that the emperor’s suit is finished, they mime dressing him, and he sets off in a procession before the whole city. The townsfolk go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear stupid or to offend the king. Eventually, when a child blurts out that the emperor has no clothes, the collective spell is broken, and everyone sees things as they truly are.</p>
<p>It took a child to name the problem and expose the flawed thinking that surrounded it. How might childlike eyes help us better see the damage and ineffectiveness created by our collective idolatries?39 For instance, what if, instead of hearing our own voice in its circular reasoning, we, as the church, listened to what our neighbors think about us? Perhaps if we really want people who are apparently far from Jesus to hear and learn the manifold wisdom of God, we ought to become aware of how our collective failures repel a watching world.</p>
<p>In order to be childlike, we must engage with metanoia as an inherent</p>
