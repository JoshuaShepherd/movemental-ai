<h2>— PETER DRUCKER</h2>
<p>During the Chinese Communist revolution of the twentieth century, leaders of the underground Chinese church learned to adapt pretty fast — not only their lives but also the very survival of the Christian church in their country was at stake. What they experienced as a terrible adapt-or-die experience gifted us one of the most remarkable revelations about the most fundamental nature of the church as Jesus designed it to be: Apostolic Genius. The Chinese underground church phenomenon of the last sixty years, where against all odds the persecuted church grew from about 2 million to over 120 million, is quite possibly the most remarkable manifestation of Apostolic Genius in the history of the church. And it is a gift to us because it teaches us about ourselves as a different cultural expression of the very same ecclesia, with all the same latent potentials as of those Chinese peasants.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing that is learned through the Chinese experience, along with every other apostolic movement in history, is that the church Jesus started already has everything in it to get its job done.</p>
<p>Read that sentence again: ecclesia is perfectly designed to fulfill its mission and purpose. This is as true for them as it is for us, because Jesus is the Founder and Designer of the church wherever it might manifest. What is more, we can say that every believer — and by extension, every believing community of Christ — has the same full potential for world transformation present in even the smallest part. Apostolic Genius is latent within the ecclesia, and given the right conditions, it can be reactivated and can transform the church into a potent movement of the gospel.</p>
<p>What these great movements learned through sheer force of circumstance, we are going to learn and apply in a much more deliberative and determined way. In this book, we are trying to do precisely that: this chapter will focus on describing the essentials of the paradigm. Our aim in the Verge church approach is clear: we hope to revive the same dormant potentials in your church/organization that existed within the early church, the Chinese church, and every other exponential missional movement in history — nothing less. But in order to do this, we have to effectively dislodge the predominant institutional paradigm by replacing it with the more movemental one. How do we do that? By reactivating Apostolic Genius that already resides in your church. Remember, Apostolic Genius is by nature an inclusive paradigm of church; therefore it is able to incorporate and include the more institutional expression while making real shift toward diverse new forms.</p>
<p>Apostolic Genius is a paradigm, a way or model of thinking, but it is also more than that. It actually describes the intelligence, the "genius" that is distributed throughout the system that in the New Testament is called ecclesia. It has everything to do with God's Spirit, the transformative power of the gospel, and the way that God has created human systems and people-movements to generate and organize. Monday is as spiritually important as Sunday. In fact, apart from the “Jesus is Lord” factor, every other element of mDNA can be found in other movements, Christian or not! For example, “discipleship” is simply the church’s language for identity formation and developing its adherents, and “organic systems” is just a way we can frame what happens in all distributed networks everywhere.1 Communitas is experienced by something as common as a sports team every time they play!</p>
<p>I say this very carefully, but phenomenologically speaking, Al Qaeda exhibits all the elements except for the central defining one — Jesus is Lord! Yes, they use different terms, and there will be some disparities, but the phenomenon itself, as a manifestation of a people-movement, is remarkably analogous. We are a Jesus movement, and they are a (in this case, particularly violent) Mohammed movement, but this most essential difference highlights the similarities.</p>
<p>What this shocking comparison illustrates is that in a generic sense, something akin to Apostolic Genius is already coded into the created order, not just into the church. Much as C. S. Lewis observed that the Christ story is the “true myth” that provides the scaffolding from which all other great myths flow (see, for instance, the prodigious work of Joseph Campbell), so mDNA is the deep architecture of all movements, however distant they become from our living and vital Source. In the church, Apostolic Genius simply takes its very specific, Jesus-shaped form!</p>
<p>This is hopeful for us because it allows us to see that we are not foisting something onto the church as if it were some alien imposition, but rather we are activating something that is dormant, something that is already there! In some ways, we simply have to remember what we have forgotten.</p>
<h2>Apostolic Genius</h2>
<p>What follows here is really a working summary of what I explained more fully in The Forgotten Ways and have tried to elaborate in all my subsequent writings. It should provide an adequate, and I hope convincing, description of the core ideas necessary for movement. However, if a church or organization is really serious about applying the Verge process described here, then I strongly suggest that the entire leadership team undertake a serious study of the basic text as well as the associated handbook.2 Hopefully, it is clear by now that there is no way around the need for leadership to have a real grasp of movemental paradigm if they are going to lead the church into the new possibilities of movement. If this seems too difficult, or if there is no collective will to transition, then we suggest that it is probably best to leave things as they are. As we have seen, paradigms are not birthed easily, and it requires prayerful processing of change, some deep thinking, the political will to get the job done, along with some serious strategic planning if we have any chance of successful transition to becoming an apostolic movement. I don’t want to make this sound unnecessarily complicated; gaining missional movementum is simple but challenging. It is simple (and it has to be, if anyone can do this) because it is based on these six elements, but it is challenging because of the nature of change and reversing momentum.</p>
<p>The process of becoming an apostolic movement ought to be holistic and should be applied systemwide. This is not to say that there are not real benefits in applying each element of mDNA on its own; for instance, there clearly would be an improvement if a church made disciple-making a core task or activated fivefold forms of ministry and leadership. Each of the elements, if successfully applied, will bring the church closer to the kind of church Jesus designed in the first place. But if we wish to see our church become an authentic missional movement, one capable of rapid, sustainable expansion, regional impact, and high influence, then all six elements have to be activated and correlated in ways that usher the entire system into a new form of ecclesia, a new and yet ancient way of being the church — that of apostolic movements.</p>
<p>So what are the elements, and how do they change the way we are and do church? Diagrammatically, it can be represented as in figure 12.</p>

<h2>Jesus Is Lord</h2>
<p>When Christians dream about the growth of the church, we can become highly excited by the success of exponential movements. But a critical, often neglected consideration with such movements is the question, what exactly are we multiplying? What is the church’s core message, and are we delivering it properly? This takes us directly to the gospel and to Jesus and his role and function in the life of his people, anytime and anyplace. In theological circles, this is called Christology, and it’s the most basic but poignant theological touchstone of the church. It is our North Star, our compass, and our central criterion as Jesus’ people.</p>
<p>At the center and circumference of every significant Jesus movement, there exists a confession that is both simple and complex: what we can call a simplex confession. Simple, in that it can be easily understood and passed on from person to person; complex, because it carries the full weight of biblical monotheism. The way this was expressed in the New Testament church and in later movements was simply, "Jesus is Lord!" With this simplex confession, they changed the world.</p>
<p>Massive theological weight loads into these three words; in fact, there is a whole worldview in these three words! There are at least two aspects to this.</p>
<p>First is the aspect of lordship, or sovereignty, that Jesus is Lord (or Master or King or Messiah). When we use this phrase, in the context of the biblical understanding of YHWH’s lordship, it goes to the very heart of the biblical revelation of the one true God. The teaching that God is Lord over his creation, what theologians have called ethical monotheism, or what Jesus himself calls the kingdom of God, is the subterranean message undergirding all of Scripture. It doesn’t get any deeper than that!</p>
<p>Whatever meanings the Old Testament applied to the idea that YHWH is Lord are transferred fully to the New Testament claim that Jesus is Lord. What’s more, this is an exclusive claim; it means we always turn to God from false lords and idols (Rom. 1:18; 1 Thess.</p>
<p>1:9), and God thereby claims exclusive loyalty over his people. Monotheism is therefore a direct challenge to all polytheisms ancient and modern. There can be no idolatry admitted into the life of true worship — this refers not just to animistic fetishes but also to the myriad of idols prevalent in all cultures: money, sex, power, ideology, and all things that claim to bring meaning and demand the loyalty that should belong to God alone.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is a healing, redeeming force in human history, to be sure, but it also demands a certain lifestyle characterized by holiness and love. That is why we call it ethical monotheism: it forms the basis for the lifestyle we call discipleship or apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The other aspect captured in the phrase “Jesus is Lord” lies in that it’s Jesus who is Lord, and not some other person. It matters very much who it is that is sovereign Lord and King. It is Jesus, the radical, irreligious, merciful, always-surprising redeemer of our souls, who qualifies the nature of that lordship. Change the name, and the whole character of lordship changes accordingly. To get a feel for this, replace the name Jesus with Mohammed, Moloch, Mammon, or Ba’al and try to discern the different impact of each. Everything changes when the king changes.</p>
<p>A true understanding of Jesus is therefore vital to authentic Christianity. It is the particular historical revelation of Jesus that sets the tone and character of Christian discipleship and community gathered in his presence. What is more, he is the location of our saving covenant with God — he is Savior as well as Lord. So whatever we as the church might know of God, it must be mediated through the lens of the revelation given to us in Jesus the Jewish Messiah, empowered by the Spirit and exalted by the Father to become Savior of the world (1 John 4:14). This means that Jesus must always play the central role in the life of the disciple and the church.3 Whatever else he is for us, Jesus is the Founder. Because of this, he gets the defining rights to what it means to be a Christian and, by extension, what it means to be the church. This means we must always return to Jesus in order to authenticate ourselves as followers and as the church who claims his name. When the church loses this kind of defining contact with Jesus, when we lose the central focus of Christianity, some other ideology tends to take Jesus’ place, and we end up with something less than what was intended in the first place.</p>
<p>At times, people have managed to concoct an all-out toxic religion — a Christless form of Christianity — that has seriously damaged many people and the gospel. The church needs a constant checkup, and the most appropriate — no, make that the only — place to go is to Jesus, our Founder and Lord.4 How does this play out in the Verge church process described here?</p>
<p>Well, when we place this absolute commitment to Jesus at the very epicenter of church life and consciousness, it functions as an inbuilt theological touchstone, an internalized criterion for ongoing authenticity, and thus the true principle of ongoing renewal of our spirituality, discipleship, mission, and worship. As this works its way out in the life of the community, it will mean we’ll present an expression of Christianity that looks a lot like Jesus. The church should reverberate with a distinct Jesus vibe.</p>
<p>This lordship of Jesus is both the center and circumference of apostolic movements. As an element of mDNA, it functions as the touchstone that organizes and informs the others. That Jesus is Lord changes, directs, organizes, and qualifies the other aspects of mDNA: disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and communitas.</p>
<h2>Disciple-Making</h2>
<p>This element of mDNA is the one most associated with the centrality of Jesus, and it is that of discipleship and disciple-making.</p>
<p>Essentially, this involves the irreplaceable and lifelong task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message as well as his interior habits.</p>
<p>Disciple-making (or apprenticeship) is a core task of the church and needs to be structured into every church’s basic raison d’être — it must become a pervasive ethos felt at every level of the organization. When we embed discipleship and disciple-making at the mDNA level of the church, we ensure that the life of Christ flows throughout, because it will practically express itself as a commitment to be like Christ, to live like him and to rightly represent him in everything we say and do. It isn’t hard to see how and why this will profoundly affect the character and expression of the church’s life and worship. When an apprentice blacksmith studies under his master, what happens after time and experience are gained? He becomes a blacksmith! Similarly, being apprenticed to Jesus, we become little versions of Jesus ourselves.</p>
<p>Although the language of discipleship does float in the ether of some church vision statements, the reality of being apprenticed in the way of Jesus is largely missing. The net result is that we are being apprenticed, but not by Jesus. There is, sadly, no neutral ground, spiritually speaking. In Western culture, our identities, actions, and sense of community and meaning are deeply shaped by the prevailing forces of mindless consumerism (the alternative religion of our day) and mediated through a very sophisticated system of formation driven by mass media and billion-dollar budgets. Mammon is alive and well; his temples are everywhere. And the church, as the focal point of this spiritual warfare, has lost significant ground in the battle because of passivity and inaction. If we don’t apprentice people, the culture surely will.</p>
<p>The reason why discipleship is such a critical key to Verge church thinking is because movements grow only in proportion to their capacity to make disciples — followers of the living Messiah. We can say this with some authority: no disciples, no movement. Some disciples, some movement. But having many disciples creates a real basis on which movements generate and develop. And so discipleship and disciplemaking are in fact the strategic missional activities in our time.</p>
<p>So much is bound up here: not only the heart of Christian spirituality — that Jesus actually lives within his people — but that our lives lived in and through him are also lives lived like his. We are imitators of Christ and not merely his fan club! Our very authenticity as Christians is bound to our capacity to rightly represent our Lord; surely a life that fails to mirror Jesus’ own earthy resplendence is but a dim reflection of who we’re created to be.</p>
<p>Our willingness and ability to live lives like Jesus’ life, what I called “embodiment of the message,”5 is the basis of the spiritual authority we have as disciples, individually and corporately. In the New Testament, authority (exousia, or literally “out of one’s life/being”) is directly associated with the capacity to live consistently with the message we seek to convey. Jesus has authority because in him, message and deed are utterly congruent — he is the active Word of God. Likewise, apprenticeship, involving as it does the embodiment of the gospel message in and through our lives, brings personal authority but also brings us credibility in the eyes of those around us. Again discipleship shows itself as crucial to our witness and our mission.</p>
<p>Another aspect of apostolic movements is directly related to this element of mDNA: leadership. Leadership is directly proportional to discipleship. If we aren't making disciples, we shouldn't wonder about the un-Christlikeness of the leadership evident in many churches. Discipleship is a prior condition of leadership in the church that Jesus built. That's why the Bible says little directly about leadership. In fact, its wisdom on the subject is deeply subversive (the last will be first, leaders should serve, not many should presume to be teachers, and so on); rather than being about leadership, everything is about apprenticeship to Jesus. Such discipleship is the key to cultivating a missional ethos. If we fail to generate a movement composed of authentic followers of Jesus and instead focus on making converts who turn into consumptive church attenders needing constant entertaining and "feeding," we'll never see apostolic movement take place. Remember, the Great Commission is about making disciples, not "decisions." Our friends at 3 Dimension Ministries (3DM) have understood this well,6 and we'll refer to their story throughout this book. If you locate missionality where it belongs — smack in the center of God's gratuitous love — then mission comes out of the core of who we are and isn't just an external task and obligation.</p>
<p>Discipleship is the key to implementation of movement, and that’s one of the reasons why it’s an irreplaceable part of the six elements of mDNA. The Verge church process requires that this become part of the ideological epicenter of the church, along with the other elements.</p>
<p>Like Jesus' lordship, it will qualify and condition all the other elements.</p>
<h2>Missional-Incarnational Impulse</h2>
<p>With the rise of the Christendom church (the institutional paradigm) — resulting from Emperor Constantine's marriage of the church to the state — the prevailing idea or conception of church became fundamentally nonmissional. Historically, the reason for this, of course, is that all who were born within the geographical realm of the Christendom civilization were considered Christian. In the American expression, Christianity was not married to the state (as in Europe) but is nonetheless seen to be an inextricable part of American culture and identity; until the last thirty years or so, if you were an American, you were a Christian, with few exceptions (Native Americans, Jews, and so on). But the net result of either hard (state-mandated) or soft (cultural) Christendom is to effectively create a domesticated civil religion which no longer challenges and transforms society but rather is co-opted by it.</p>
<p>The disastrous result of Christendom (for the mission of the church) was that the way we thought about ourselves as church became ruinously detached from the catalytic impulse of the mission of God, or Missio Dei. We forgot that it’s not so much that the church has a mission as that the mission has a church. Missiology became a subset of ecclesiology, rather than the other way around. No longer was the church seen as a result of God’s prior initiative in sending his Son, his saving mission in the world; mission was downgraded to being an inferior function of the church, a subcommittee composed of about 2 percent of the church and largely concerned with overseas missions to “pagan” lands. Mission was marginalized and then ejected from the church’s sense of identity and practice. Mission no longer set the agenda for the church’s life and ministry.</p>
<p>As a result of the overwhelming power of the Christendom paradigm, even many who claim to be missional Christians still think of mission as a subset of ecclesiology. For instance, many still think that because a church does mission, therefore it is a missional church.</p>
<p>Not so! All churches have always done some form of mission — even the most institutional. Simply reaching across cultures, even in our own neighborhoods, doesn’t mean we are missional. Rather, a truly missional understanding of the church arises from the fundamental recognition that mission is the catalyzing principle, that it actually forms and informs the church. The church takes its cue from the mission of God in the world, not the other way around. Mission shapes the church; church takes it cultural cues from mission. We ought not load ecclesiology up front in the equation. This is a very important paradigm shift in itself; it requires a conversion of sorts, and unless it can be made, there is no way to truly become missional in nature.7 One of the Future Travelers churches reframed the issue this way, moving mission from being a “department” to being the determining factor that informs all the departments (fig. 13). It’s a powerful visual clue to what is being said here.</p>

<h2>Figure 13</h2>
<p>God is the Redeemer, and we, God's redeemed people, are the result of God's love. This also means that the church emerges out of our joining God’s mission in the world. This is a liberating alternative to deadlocked church bureaucracy, because we recognize that God is already doing mission and that we can join with him. Jesus will build his church as we listen to his voice and engage in the Missio Dei.</p>
<p>What about the incarnational piece; how does that fit? If the missional approach requires that we take this sentness (for the Latin missio means “sent”) of the church seriously, then the way we are sent must be influenced directly by how God engages the world in Jesus.</p>
<p>This takes us straight to the incarnation as our primary model of how we should engage the world. God enters into the world, fully into a given context, concretely loving a people as an insider; he meets people where they are. And so the Verge church takes incarnational mission very seriously. As commissioned missionaries, we go to unchurched people where they are, and we work hard at speaking meaningfully from within the culture and so demonstrate and live out the love of God for them in Christ.</p>
<p>Missional is not just an adjective we attach to church; it is an adjective that must be attached to our faith.</p>
<p>Deriving as it does from our deepest theology, this element of mDNA goes on to shape (even prescribe) how apostolic movements extend themselves into new situations and contexts. The two terms in the phrase (missional-incarnational), though clumsy, are important because they each qualify and inform the other.</p>
<p>Getting practical, and building an appropriate model of engagement out of these essential theological truths, we can say this: on the one hand, the missional impulse describes the outward-bound impulse that urges the church to reach beyond itself to its immediate neighbors, often across cultures and class, and eventually to the whole world. It is how the gospel is “sneezed” into the world and grows exponentially (in a viral way) as it extends itself over time and space. On the other hand, the incarnational impulse describes how the gospel is embedded deeply into a culture. As the seed of the gospel falls on cultural soil, it takes root, and Christianity thus develops within that culture, in ways that make sense within that culture. It is how Christianity is contextualized into cultures and subcultures anywhere and everywhere. The missional impulse takes its cue from the Missio Dei, and the incarnational impulse takes its cue from the incarnation of the Son of God into human context. Missional God leads to missional church. Incarnational God leads to incarnational church.</p>
<p>When the missional-incarnational impulse (or imperative) is placed alongside the other elements of mDNA, at the epicenter of the church’s self-understanding, it maintains the movemental impulse to partner with God in his redemption of the world. It creates the internal pressure outward into mission and downward into culture in incarnational engagement. Theology informs methodology, and methodology is held in check by deep theology so as to avoid thoughtless and harmful syncretism.</p>
<h2>Apostolic Environment</h2>
<p>This element of mDNA relates to the type of leadership and ministry required to sustain metabolic growth and impact. For one, it means taking seriously the role of apostolic ministry in our day. This means we must open ourselves to the fertile and distinctly missional vision and energy it creates, and how it is vital in initiating and maintaining exponential missional movements. Not surprisingly, the Latin word missio has the same meaning as the Greek word apostello: “sent”!</p>
<p>Missional church is apostolic church. Any talk about missional church that doesn’t also legitimize apostolic ministry is doomed to frustration. I can’t encourage you enough to look seriously into this, so much is at stake here.</p>
<p>Many churches, and whole denominations, deny any possible legitimacy to this. But this denial itself comes directly from the inherited paradigm and is one of the major reasons why most of these selfsame churches and denominations are struggling to reverse their decline.</p>
<p>The great irony of course is that most of these denominations, when they were still in movemental forms, were started by apostolic people!</p>
<p>Even if the term itself was not always used, there is no doubting the impact of its ministry. Apostolic is what apostolic does.</p>
<p>But beyond just the recovery of apostolic ministry in our day, this mDNA really requires we significantly broaden our understanding of ministry. We need to break away from the inherited understanding of ministry as maintenance. In other words, a pastor/shepherd framework or teacher/theologian framework can (and often does) exclude other, perhaps more generative, forms of ministry. Said in another way: if we want missional church and movements, then we will simply have to have a missional ministry to go with it. There can be no way around the central importance of Paul’s description of ministry in Ephesians 4 in this regard. Ministry in Verge churches will therefore be at least fivefold in form. I, for one, simply can’t get away from the feeling that Ephesians 4 is critical genetic information about the ministry of the church. We avoid this to our great detriment.</p>
<p>I deliberately use the term ministry, not leadership, here because Ephesians 4:7 – 11 indicates that this fivefold gifting relates to all the people in the church and not just to those who lead. How can we say this? Because this is a general letter, packed with concentrated Pauline ecclesiology, to be read aloud in the churches. (And the churches were made up of men and women, slaves and nobles, and so on.) Ephesians 4:7 – 11 explicitly says that grace is given “to each one of us” and that it is Christ who gives it. In other words, it’s not primarily a leadership text! Rather it describes the ministry of Christ expressing itself through the body of Christ. Leadership is implied in ministry, not the other way around. Remember, everyone gets to play. This is a very radical text indeed!</p>
<p>It also means that every church is packed with all kinds of ministry potential; churches aren’t just playgrounds for pastors and teachers.</p>
<p>We’ve found a useful acronym in this passage of Scripture: APEST.8 It’s an outline for Jesus’ playground.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Apostles are architecturally and missionally oriented.</p>
<p>Prophets are questioners of the status quo, demanding faithfulness.</p>
<p>Evangelists are recruiters to the cause — the infectious people.</p>
<p>Shepherds (pastors) care and create community.</p>
<p>Teachers bring wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t the church (or any organization, for that matter) be better off by having all five of these players present and operative? Of course! How could we fulfill our mission and purpose without them?</p>
<p>Answer: we can’t.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 – 16 unambiguously declares that we can’t mature without APEST! Read verses 1 – 16 again: verses 1 – 6 represent the unity factors, verses 7 – 11 describe APEST, and verses 11 – 16 describe the resultant maturity in the body of Christ. How did we ever think we could possibly mature with just the anemic twofold form of shepherd/pastor and teacher?</p>
<p>When this is placed in the paradigmatic heart of the church (along with the other elements of mDNA), it will legitimize and activate a far more potent, comprehensive, multidimensional ministry that can both initiate and maintain Verge churches. It will also call into question the sorely limited view of ministry and leadership we have inherited from the more institutional and missionally neutered forms of church handed down from Christendom. Churches that have active and authentic APEST forms of ministry are almost always movemental in nature.9</p>
<h2>Organic Systems</h2>
<p>The truth is, over centuries the church has been (largely) taken captive to an institutional and structural way of organizing. When we think of church, we think of the institution of church (for example, its buildings, clergy, creeds, rituals, denominational templates, symbols).</p>
<p>It’s very hard for anyone, even non-Christians now, to think of the church in any other way. But this isn’t the way the original church manifested itself, and it certainly isn’t our most potent expression, which is namely that of apostolic movement. The problem with an overly institutional conception of church is that it basically overconcretizes and freezes in time the way we see ourselves as the people of God — and this is problematic.</p>
<p>This is not to say that institutional structures are all bad; certainly, their intent is almost always good. Even so, concretized institutionalization does tend to block some of the most powerful aspects of ecclesia as Jesus intended it: a potent social force and gospel phenomenon that sweeps through populations. Any reading of history, Christian or otherwise, shows us that institutional religion can become repressive, stifling creative expression.</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental reboots we need to do in our day is to rediscover ourselves as the same potent, transforming people-movement that started with Jesus and went on to change the world. The institutional forms have gotten us where we are now and can’t take us much farther. We need to become a people-movement again.</p>
<p>We need to take the New Testament’s meaning of ecclesia/church again with utmost seriousness. I’m more and more convinced this word contains the full meaning of what we are trying to articulate about apostolic movement. Ecclesia in the Bible doesn’t refer to some building or religious institution (no scholar would argue otherwise); rather it was borrowed from the process of Roman city assemblies — it means “gathering.” But even more significant, as far as I can determine, ecclesia has four distinct levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ecclesia as the people of God expressing the ministry of Christ</li>
</ol>
<p>in every sphere and domain</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ecclesia as the local church</li>
<li>Ecclesia as the citywide church</li>
<li>Ecclesia as the universal church</li>
</ol>
<p>The term applies at every level of expression and organization!</p>
<p>In other words, ecclesia is movement! We’ve allowed this big word to come to mean something profoundly different than what it originally meant — we have had a nasty case of long-term paradigm blindness, and it’s time to move.</p>
<p>What we now have are somewhat inflexible, backward-looking, often fearful and defensive forms of church. What we need are missionally responsive, culturally adaptive, organizationally agile multiplication movements. Verge churches — because they are apostolic movements — mobilize the whole people of God, are reproducing and reproducible, are structurally agile networked (avoiding centralization of power and function), and employ missional leadership and ministry modes.</p>
<p>Both Dave and I have no doubt that if there is to be any advancing of the Western church in the twenty-first century, it will be marked by the recovery of the apostolic movement form of church. In fact, we suggest that if we fail to somehow rediscover this mode of church, we may eventually lose all significant cultural impact and become a footnote to Western history. In the final section of this book, we will present a detailed approach to what it means to activate movements, but at the very least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movements mobilize the whole people of God. The real revolution</li>
</ul>
<p>comes when all the people of God get to embrace their Godgiven destiny as active agents of the King. Surely, one of the most potent ecclesial doctrines in the New Testament is the priesthood of all believers, yet it’s one we’ve seldom lived out. Clergy and professionals can be control freaks. We need to recognize that Jesus is well able to lead his people and doesn’t require professionals to keep us on track!</p>
<ul>
<li>Movements are reproducing and reproducible. In truth, much</li>
</ul>
<p>of what we do as church is unwieldy and very hard to reproduce — largely because of our captivity to institutional forms.</p>
<p>In contrast, exponential missional movements thrive on rapid and spontaneous expansion and can be achieved by all agents in the system. That’s why they’re able to achieve what Roland Allen calls “spontaneous expansion.” To say it another way, reproduction necessitates “reproduce-ability,” and reproducibility requires an ecclesiology simple enough for any disciple to reproduce.</p>
<p>The church Jesus designed, the one in the pages of the New Testament, is precisely that: a grassroots people-movement with a vision for the transformation of society, operating as a decentralized network, spreading like a virus, and profoundly reproducible by every active agent in the system. Verge churches must be willing to reconceive themselves as people-movements. They can no longer simply see themselves, through an institutional lens, as “churches”; rather they must see themselves as embryonic movements in the making.</p>
<p>(In other words, they must become ecclesia!) When we are willing to see that every believer can be a church planter and every church can be a church-planting church, then we will reorganize to make that happen, and things will change.10 Verge churches recognize the power of this form of ecclesia and are willing to increasingly move in this direction. For instance, Soma is one of the Future Travelers churches that has already morphed into the early stages of movement envisioned here.11 Others are heading in the right direction,12 but it's important to note that in order to be a decentralized movement, we need to activate all six elements of mDNA and not just one.</p>
<p>This is not to say that pure movemental forms are the only true manifestations of missional structure. By God’s common grace, there are many ways in which humans organize, some more theologically consistent and missionally potent than others. But it is to say that intentional movemental forms are most consistent with the reality of being an apostolic movement. Most likely, Verge churches will have elements of centralized organization in them — they will be hybrids of sorts — but they will definitely need to learn what it means to operate as a decentralized network if they are determined to move beyond the limitations (and costs) imposed by hierarchical organization. Much will depend on whether these churches can activate the whole people of God, but when and if they do, they will almost certainly need to learn the power of the more fluid, networked, movemental structures. If we can’t become a fully-fledged organic underground movement like the one in China (and that is unlikely, given our context, culture, and history), we can certainly begin to approximate it by moving in that direction.</p>
<h2>Communitas</h2>
<p>The word communitas captures the idea of the enhanced forms of community that emerges from the context of a shared ordeal, a common task, an organizational challenge, even danger. The context of the challenge forces a restructuring of the basic relational fabric of the group. In such situations, people move from being associates to becoming comrades, from being acquaintances who happen to bump into each other at church-related activities to being partners bound together in common cause.</p>
<p>Communitas is easy to spot once you’ve seen it: sports teams, leadership teams at work facing deadlines, short-term missions teams, friends painting a house together. It forms a fundamental code that informs almost every story of coming together against the odds, whether in film, comics, or novels. People are moved outside what is perceived as safe, predictable, and normal, only to find themselves and others in a new and profound way. It forms the most basic aspect of the human adventure.</p>
<p>Relating this to the most current expressions of church will mean we become far less risk-averse, more missional, and more willing to experiment by engaging in open-ended learning together. It will also mean we need to lean into the future and engage with our cultural contexts, as these will force us to more adaptive expressions of ecclesia.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the section on paradigms and innovation, too much concern with safety and security, combined with comfort and convenience, has lulled us out of our true calling and purpose and has effectively blocked our God-given creativity.13</p>
<h2>A Mindset, Not a Technique</h2>
<p>We suggest that any church wishing to move toward being a Verge church will need to really study the paradigm shifts necessary to become an apostolic movement (see the resources section in the back of this book). But if God is in the details, so is the Devil! Don’t let annotated bibliographies keep you and your community from (as John Wimber used to put it) doing the stuff! Trust what God has put into you; be willing to follow your deepest instinct in living it out.</p>
<p>What you should be inspired by here is the sheer vigor of a church that can combine all six elements of the mDNA in Apostolic Genius: when a church takes Jesus with utmost seriousness and refers all matters of its life to him, when it embeds discipleship as a defining activity at every level, when it activates a broader missional ministry based on Ephesians 4, when it learns to organize and operate as a decentralized people-movement, engaging in incarnational mission and being willing to takes risks and learn, you can be sure it’s spiritually healthy and transformative. When this happens, it not only describes the possibility of movement; it is movement.</p>
<p>Please note: I do not mean to suggest some sort of ecclesiological “technique” or church methodology here. Apostolic Genius is a mindset, an approach, a phenomenon, a way of thinking and doing church.</p>
<p>It is the much-needed silver imagination for our times. There are internal checks and balances within it to keep it from degenerating into a mere technique. For instance, commitment to Jesus' kingdom at the heart of the church — together with the willingness to become more and more like him (apprenticeship) — ensures the spiritual health of the movement, at the heart of the movement. A movement of radical disciples worshiping Jesus as Lord cannot but be a worshiping, praying, Spirit-led, Spirit-empowered church.</p>
<p>Now pause.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath: God is good. Selah.</p>
<p>If you feel like you’ve absorbed too much in this chapter, let it go.</p>
<p>But circle back to it again later and read the material more slowly, leisurely. Anything worth knowing is worth knowing thoroughly, and we needn’t make ourselves frenetic wrecks while doing so. This is a vital discipline in our media-saturated world. You’ll be shocked at how much clearer everything will become on a subsequent read.</p>
<p>This is the Missio Dei, and to participate in it is the highest calling you can possibly imagine, so relax and enjoy it. Let your longing lead you. The vision we’re seeing for the church can be summed up in this quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “If you want to build a ship, don’t summon people to buy wood, prepare tools, distribute jobs, and organize the work — rather, teach people the yearning for the wide, boundless ocean.”</p>
<h2>Dave's Response to "Apostolic Genius: The Genetic Code of Movement"</h2>
<p>While Alan took the lead on this chapter, I fully endorse and believe the inherent truth in what he calls Apostolic Genius, and I wholeheartedly agree that it gives us the genetic code of all apostolic movements. I believe this in part because it’s supported by my own research, observation, and personal experience as a church planter (Community Christian Church) and leader of an emerging movement (New Thing). The other reason is because I have heard Alan very humbly and privately talk about the six elements of mDNA as a grace that God gave him for the church. He would tell you that his understanding of Apostolic Genius is not merely a product of his own intellect but came to him almost supernaturally as a gift from God for the church, and I believe him.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to elevate this apostolic paradigm to the level of Scripture, I am saying that both the source of this revelation and my own practice of it tell me that what we have here is a missional archetype from the primal heartbeat of God.</p>
<h2>Beware of Being Too Familiar</h2>
<p>As a practitioner in the midst of interacting with this apostolic paradigm, let me offer some words of caution. The elements you think you know the most may be the ones you know the least. As I have interviewed church leaders transitioning their churches to movemental thinking and behaving, a common reaction to looking at the first two of the six elements is, “ ‘Jesus is Lord’ and disciple-making? We got ’em! Let’s move on.” And they move on to the more exotic-sounding elements of missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and communitas — all the while leaving their culturally conditioned assumptions about Jesus’ all-pervasive lordship and thoroughgoing apprenticeship unexamined. The last four, because they sound less familiar than the first two, capture our attention and our energy.</p>
<p>Here is my caution: beware of being too familiar with “Jesus is Lord” and disciple-making. There’s a lot to be unpacked in these potent-but-overused phrases.14 The Familiarity of “Jesus Is Lord” More than one church leader has confessed to me that while making this paradigm shift early on, they got the missional virus and started infecting everyone around them. They communicated vision and strategy for people to be on mission, and they genuinely and fervently prayed that their people would get it. But along the way, mission became the a priori, not Jesus. Missional became a new form of legalism. As is often the case in sick systems, if we aren’t careful, we can replace one addiction for another rather than discovering the cure.</p>
<p>In this case, they replaced self-righteousness with mission. Mission became more important than Jesus, because the mission was where people looked to find their identity. Their value was not in Jesus but in "being on mission" and in what they accomplished for "the mission." What they discovered is that mission is a terrible lord. The mission will always ask and expect more from you than you can deliver and will ultimately abandon you and leave you disappointed. One church leader confided, "I recently moved my family to an underresourced part of the city in the name of mission. What I discovered is that I am prone to using living in the inner city as a trump card to give me more influence and power, because I have a tendency to love influence and power more than I love Jesus." Warning: don’t let your infatuation with mission allow your love for Jesus to wander. Don’t let Jesus become too familiar. Jesus is a great Master. Jesus enjoys you and takes pleasure in you and delights in you, and he will be a great Lord. He won’t kick you to the curb when you let him down. We’re not selling Amway here, friends! Multilevel empire-building isn’t the name of the game. Entire Christian movements have been built on these premises devoid of a living encounter with Jesus, and wrecked lives are always the result. Missional living is really about allowing Jesus to be Lord of your life and then telling the good news of what Jesus is doing in your life. Mission only works when we make Jesus Lord and his mission flows out of that.</p>
<p>The Familiarity of Disciple-Making Just as churches think they already know what it means to make Jesus Lord, even more churches will say to themselves, “Oh, we understand disciple-making.” But the Reveal study conducted by Willow Creek was a wake-up call that churches don’t get it. What they understand is their old paradigm of disciple-making. And the old paradigm is more about consuming cognitive content and not engaging in missional action. The old paradigm of disciple-making is about an individual’s ability to get a passing grade on a subject matter, rather than being led by the Spirit 24/7 to follow after Jesus and to trade their life for the mission. It’s indoctrination without transformation.</p>
<p>The Introduction of new language is crucial for reshaping paradigms and getting people to think differently about the movement of Jesus. For that reason, I intentionally use the word apprentice as opposed to disciple. While disciple is a brilliant word, it doesn’t mean today what it meant in the Bible. When Jesus called people into discipleship, it was a calling into the Father’s mission and into preparation in every way to accomplish that mission.</p>
<p>You may choose to continue to use disciple terminology, but that choice may get you the same kind of static thinking and behavior you’re trying to change. I much prefer the term apprentice. The power of apprentice is that it clearly says you not only are a learner but also are in a relationship to take on more responsibility to further the missional movement of Jesus. First and foremost, we must apprentice with Jesus, and second, we must bring someone alongside us whom we will apprentice, just as Paul did when he encouraged churches to “imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1 NKJV). The apprenticeship process not only inherently has a missional intention but also has a movemental outcome because built into it is the ongoing reproduction of other Christ followers.15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking You Know, When You Don’t</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the macro paradigm shift to apostolic movement are the six micro-shifts in regard to each element of mDNA. As I’ve already explained, the shifts in regard to “Jesus is Lord” and disciple-making are often the most challenging, because churches and leaders think they know what they don’t know. The last four shifts of missionalincarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, and communitas are often not as challenging, because in most cases churches and leaders know they don’t know. The steps we take along the journey of Apostolic Genius remind me of then–Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's quixotic words of reflection during the buildup to the Iraq conflict nearly a decade ago, taken verbatim but arranged as poetry by the online magazine Salon: As we know, There are known knowns.</p>
<p>There are things we know we know.</p>
<p>We also know There are known unknowns.</p>
<p>That is to say We know there are some things We do not know.</p>
<p>But there are also unknown unknowns, The ones we don't know We don't know.16 When we interact with the stuff of God and destiny and eternity, we will often be the ones who "see through a mirror dimly." But as long as we are oriented Godward, being led toward Christ by the compass of the Holy Spirit, we are safe. As we progress in learning and action, we will begin to enjoy the unknown unknowns, becoming ever more responsive to the wisdom and leading of the Incarnate God in our midst.</p>

<p>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God’s people for works of ser vice, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.</p>
