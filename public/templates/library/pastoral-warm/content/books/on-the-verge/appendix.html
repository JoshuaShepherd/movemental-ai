<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>One group from Austin Stone decided to meet at a Whole Foods store in downtown Austin every week to worship and pray. During their meeting time, they started to experience what it means to be missional in an urban area — bringing church into the common places of life and having people ask about what they were doing. They were inspired to adopt a coffee shop near the Whole Foods, and it became their go-to place whenever they had a break at work or free time.</p>
<p>Through their time hanging out at this coffee shop, they got to know the manager and the regulars. Through the relationships they formed, they led one person to Christ. Their energy and passion spread so quickly that within two months they multiplied into five groups.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experiments. Their leaders bring a group of people together</li>
</ul>
<p>for missional imagination and ask, “What would it look like for you to incarnate the gospel in your workplace or your neighborhood?” While this process produces various degrees of success, it gives believers a place to create and take risks without the fear of failure.</p>

</ul>
<p>communities. Not only does this set the tone for the church as a whole, but also they have fresh stories with which to encourage the church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling. They have found that telling stories about people</li>
</ul>
<p>who are living missionally inspires believers more than most anything else. It gives them practical examples and ideas for mission in their own lives.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Austin Stone got the “missional bug” four years ago. It started from a dissatisfaction with the way their small groups were functioning; they were not developing true community. Around this time, some of their leaders were reading thebook of Acts every week for two months. In their reading, they came to the realization that true community comes out of mission; the community of Acts 2 came out of the people on mission in Acts 1. The leaders of Austin Stone thought back on the times in their lives when they experienced authentic community, and they realized it was when they had been a part of a sacrificial mission. As they looked for a new building, Matt Carter, the lead pastor, sensed a call from God to go to the most underresourced and at-risk community in Austin — St. John’s. Soon after, a piece of property opened up in that area, and they bought it for the new campus of their church. This new building will serve as a place of worship and redemption for the city of Austin as they join the church building with a center for different nonprofits to work side by side. Their vision for the future is to create networks of churches and missional communities throughout Austin in every stratum of society. They plan on sending out one hundred people to one hundred unengaged people groups over the next two years.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>I dolizing mission. They started to put missional living on the</li>
</ul>
<p>pedestal above Jesus. They were tempted to find their identity, value, and righteousness in missional imagination instead of in Jesus. It became a new type of legalism for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing true community. Early on, the people were having</li>
</ul>
<p>trouble developing community, but they found that when Jesus is the center of their lives, mission and community follow naturally. com mu n i t y Chri s t i a n Church Location: Chicago, I llinois Campuses and size: twelve sites in Chicagoland, with 6,000 people Established: 1989 Website: www. communitychristian. org Key missional leader: Kim Hammond</p>
<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Aman named Mark Dwyer wanted to reach men far from God, so he decided to use golf as an avenue for developing relationships. He struck up a friendship with the managers of a local golf course and arranged a discounted rate when his group came through. This enabled him and other Christians to develop trust with those far from God and have spiritual conversations while they played golf. After the games, they hung out in the clubhouse, and a small-group dynamic developed as they enjoyed a common sport together. This has continued to grow and has reproduced to three golf courses and includes more than three hundred golfers.</p>
<p>Awoman named Beth Kolar went out to her local gym to make it a “third place” where she could develop relationships with non-Christians. She got to know the owner’s son Nate in particular, as well as other regulars, when she would come to work out at the gym. She decided to invite her new friends on her journey by asking them to join her in a fundraiser for the Leukemia &#x26; Lymphoma Society. Since the event was sponsored by Carter’s, Inc., they called it “Push-Ups for Carter” and raised a few thousand dollars. It was through working 306 Church Profiles together in this group project that people bonded and formed some kind of commonality besides simply working out. Then, on a climactic day, Beth shaved her head for the fundraiser, and Nate and his fiancée, Julie, were baptized into Christ. This experience impacted them as a group so much that they ended up forming a small group.</p>
<p>Nate became Beth’s apprentice leader in the small group and eventually became the leader of another group.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>School of Theology. Leaders teach and dialogue about mission</li>
</ul>
<p>with men and women in a classroom setting. The leaders are intentional about giving language (ways of thinking) and license (permission) for being missional.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling. Leaders regularly tell stories on Sunday mornings</li>
</ul>
<p>about people from their church who are engaged in mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modeling. The staff of Community Christian knows that they</li>
</ul>
<p>have to model mission and lead from the front. The staff is first engaged in missional pilot projects, which are then rolled out to leaders and then to attenders of Community Christian.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The written word. Community Christian provides written material to encourage independent study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ntegration. They have found that integrating missional communities with existing small groups ministry creates a movement and not just a ministry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Started as a reproducing church, Community Christian has a history of rapidly reproducing both campuses and churches. Community has twelve campuses, and the church planting mission of New Thing has about one hundred churches and sites. The leadership of Community is building on their past success of reproducing macro and challenging their campus pastors, leaders, and people to reproduce micro. The biggest missional shift is in the small group ministry of Community Christian. While small groups have always had an outward evangelistic focus, they are now challenging all the small groups to be either a group on a mission or a group of missionaries. The group on a mission is brought together for a common mission. The group of missionaries comes together so individuals can be held accountable for being on mission. When this shift is complete, it is the hope of the leadership of Community to have the number of people who are engaged in mission equal the average weekend celebration-ser vice attendance.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Celebrating the small. Community Christian has done well at</li>
</ul>
<p>celebrating the larger wins, such as a new campus launch and new church plants, but they want to celebrate smaller wins in the church, such as a soccer mom who is on mission as she goes about her day.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Aman named Bob Mc Dowell from Granger Community, having come out of both drugs and prison, was transformed through Celebrate Recovery (CR). He decided to turn his past misery into a missional ministry. For the last two and a half years, he has gone into a nearby prison to volunteer as a chaplain. He leads a CR group, and his mission is to help inmates transition back into society. He takes them into the community to work and prepare for reintegration. He recently started taking a group from the reentry facility of the prison to Granger’s community center on Monroe Circle every Friday for a church ser vice designed for inmates. His work has been so effective that the Department of Corrections invited him to bring the Friday 308 Church Profiles night ser vice into the prison each week. One-third of the entire prison showed up for their first ser vice. Bob and others from the church have been so successful at helping inmates reengage society that the Department of Corrections wants to take their efforts to other facilities in Indiana. The leaders at Granger Community see potential for a missional movement even in the prisons of Indiana.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Both/and. Granger Community values both missional innovation as well as weekend ser vices. They plan on continuing this balance as they reach people from all arenas of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grassroots origins. Their primary example of missional innovation is the Monroe Circle Community Center (MC3), which started on a grassroots level (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipping and releasing. When people come to the leaders of</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Granger Community with ideas for mission, the leaders equip them for the project instead of making it the staff’s responsibility. They have found that this empowers and energizes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missionary thinking. Instead of seeing Granger Community</li>
</ul>
<p>merely as a church, they see themselves as missionaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book study. The leaders at Granger Community went through</li>
</ul>
<p>The Forgotten Ways with the hope that many of the ideas will trickle down to the church as a whole.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Granger Community has an interesting story in regard to mission.</p>
<p>They planted over 957 churches in India over the last ten years, with more than one hundred and twenty thousand people meeting on a weekly basis. But the sending church in Indiana has not grown the same way. Their heart in this shift is to bring that same missional impulse from I ndia to their local church in I ndiana. They see this shift happening through people like Jody and Sarah, two people who represent what is happening at Granger Community’s I ndiana location. These two women came back changed from a short-term mission trip in Chicago. They had been hosting a vacation Bible school, and as they left, the kids from the VBS asked them, “When are you coming back?” They could not really answer the question because they were not planning on coming back. The question loomed over them.</p>
<p>In fact, it bothered them so much that they decided to do something about it in their hometown. So they went to the leaders of Granger Community, asking the church for help, but the leaders responded, “God has called you to do this, so you need to do it.” They took initiative and went to Granger’s housing authority. The city told them that the kids in the neighborhood needed to be mentored. Their first event of Son City Kids included only seven kids, but in eighteen months over one hundred children were coming each week for life skills. After that, Jody and Sarah were led to start a class called “Life Basics,” for the kids’ mothers. This grassroots movement spread to another group from the church, which turned a local food pantry on Monroe Circle into a café. Granger Community ended up partnering with Panera Bread and Starbucks to help out with food and drinks. The project has become known as the Monroe Circle Community Center (MC3).</p>
<p>The church ended up buying the entire city block of Monroe Circle, saving it from staying in ruins or being destroyed. The city even gave them one hundred and ten thousand dollars to do it! These are the beginnings of a movement at Granger Community. What started with two women turned into a movement of two hundred to three hundred people. As the leaders at Granger Community look to the next five years, they envision one hundred thousand reproducing disciples and two thousand reproducing churches. This calls for more change in the next five years of their church than in the last twenty-five years combined.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vision casting. As the leaders at Granger Community look at</li>
</ul>
<p>their goals for the next five years, they anticipate challenges in vision casting as they change the church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing it home. Historically, Granger Community has done</li>
</ul>
<p>amazing work in other fields. Their challenge now is to bring the success they have had on the foreign mission field home to Indiana.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Amember of the Journey, named Joe, owns a used-car lot and decided to start a Wednesday night gathering there. The people who come are mishmashed — some come from the neighborhood, and some work in the used-car lot. But Joe, and now a team of leaders from the Journey, are reaching out to the wide variety of people who come.</p>
<p>Another man from the Journey opened a thrift shop in Belleville, I llinois, a town just across the river from St. Louis. Two community groups from the Journey decided to meet in the storefront area of the shop so the groups can minister to the people who frequent the thrift shop as they come in and out. These community groups have become missional communities.</p>
<p>Josh Wilson and his family are moving into the neighborhood of impoverished people east of St. Louis (specifically, Forrest Park Southeast) with two other families from the church. Their house church attracted a lot of people, and they thought it would be beneficial to move there. While the church is doing good work in the schools and in the community, these three families have decided to move to this part of the city in order to be incarnational and on mission.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagination. The Journey invited seventeen leaders from various ministries together in order to read, brainstorm, and dream about how they could be missional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community Loop is a website where the leaders of community</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>groups can go to find hundreds of ser vice opportunities in the city.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passion from the pulpit. The missional imagination of their</li>
</ul>
<p>people comes from consistent preaching in the pulpit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equipping. Instead of getting everyone in their church to become missional all at once, they have come alongside the passionate and proactive in order to equip them for mission. They believe that the movement will spread more naturally this way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection and delegation. When people at the Journey have</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ideas for ministry or mission, the leaders are selective about whom they support (selection), and the ones they support are encouraged to work out the mission for themselves without relying too heavily on the church leaders (delegation).</p>
<ul>
<li>Discipleship. They understand the importance of the tangible</li>
</ul>
<p>act of love, but they also understand the importance of spiritual discipleship alongside works of ser vice. This influences the way they approach mission — a both/and approach.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>From the beginning, mission has been one of the core values in the DNA of the Journey. For them, the shift is revitalization of who they have been. They are moving closer to what has been their heart all along. This means that they are gathering leaders from the Journey to imagine new things they could do in the city of St. Louis.</p>
<p>The energy from these meetings has influenced their small groups culture to the point that if you are in a small group, you sign up for one in your neighborhood. This gives place and specificity to their kingdom efforts. They may be moving more slowly than other more explosive groups, but it is because they are intentional about people development and training. Their growth goal is not simply numerical but developmental as well. In the future, they envision missional communities as the avenues through which God impacts their city for Christ.</p>
<p>312 Church Profiles</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time. People in their church often repeat the line, “I don’t have</li>
</ul>
<p>time.” The truth, leadership has found, is that people spend too much time on entertainment and futile pursuits, time they could be using for missional engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining church. Recently the Journey has started to hear</li>
</ul>
<p>people in their church push for more programs, but they are trying to define church as missional prerogative, not institutional programs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fake community. While people seem to be connected through</li>
</ul>
<p>social media and networks, the Journey struggles to create authentic community in which people connect on a deep, spiritual level. This is a missional imperative for them because their efforts to win people will be lost without real community.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Kensington’s “Field and Stream” team is made of hundreds of guys who take kids from inner-city Detroit to the country for fishing and hunting trips.</p>
<p>Another group from the church decided they were done putting on BBQs just for themselves, so they started cooking BBQs in the middle of Detroit for the homeless.</p>
<p>“Full-Throttle” is a group of people with a passion for automobiles that restores cars, raffles them off, and donates the money to innercity schools.</p>
<p>The youth group is engaging the city through “Reverse” — they go into a racially segregated neighborhood in the city to serve; then they reverse the project by inviting the same people they served to come to the suburbs the next week so they can all serve together.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>“Reset.” This was a churchwide study on the person of Jesus</li>
</ul>
<p>which culminated in two hundred ser vice events. Each of the two hundred groups wrote a short proposal, and the church gave money to fund the various projects proposed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Question-asking. The leaders at Kensington have found that</li>
</ul>
<p>asking, “Where can you make the biggest impact this week?” stimulates missional imagination in their church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling. Kensington is constantly telling stories on Sunday</li>
</ul>
<p>mornings, in small groups, and through their website to inspire their people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redefinitions. They are reorienting definitions of church and</li>
</ul>
<p>small groups in a way that helps believers see mission in both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissional leadership. They give permission to the visionaries</li>
</ul>
<p>in their church to be creative, innovative, and imaginative as they explore mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission-driven groups. They always encourage their small</li>
</ul>
<p>groups to find outward-focused goals.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Kensington has been on mission since they were planted in 1990.</p>
<p>Their journey is characterized by openness to the Holy Spirit as they follow Jesus’ mission. They have been overseas in India and in parts of Africa for many years now, but over the last three years, God has been moving in a new way. Agroup of 15 people started to engage their community and felt led to relocate — to a different state! This group of 15, along with 135 others who caught the vision, uprooted and moved from Detroit, Michigan, to Orlando, Florida, to plant Kensington’s sixth campus. Meanwhile, the rest of the church is gearing up for a missional small groups launch through which they will encourage small group leaders to do a sixto twelve-week “relational serve.” In the future, they envision the multiplication of these 314 Church Profiles missional small groups and church campuses as they continue to follow the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discipleship. As they seek creative and innovative forms of church</li>
</ul>
<p>and mission, they have had difficulty integrating discipleship into the rhythm of the outreach strategies already in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership development. They have wrestled with leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>development in their church. For them, this is the tension between training and releasing.</p>
<p>Mos ai c Church o f Cent ra l Arka ns as Location: Little Rock, Arkansas Campuses and size: four campuses in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Durham, North Carolina, with 700 people Established: 2001 Website: www. mosaicchurch. net Lead pastor: Mark De Ymaz</p>
<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Cesar Ortega, a leader at Mosaic, suggested that the church stock a small closet with food and clothing to serve the homeless members of the church. The idea spread, and within twelve months the church had provided free assistance to 250 people. Now, after six years, more than 12,000 people benefit from this ministry every year, and the ministry also offers HIV testing, immigration counseling, job training, and other ser vices.</p>
<p>Mark De Ymaz encouraged Eric Gilmore to chase his dream of providing transitional housing and life coaching for young people who were aging out of the foster care system. The result is an organization called I mmerse Arkansas, which provides residency, case management, and wraparound ser vices to these unique young adults (ages eighteen to twenty-four) by coaching them into maturity, responsibility, and purpose.</p>
<p>As a church, Mosaic purchased an abandoned trailer in an impoverished trailer park. This gave the church an opportunity to identify and meet many of the physical, material, social, and spiritual needs of that community. In time, the neighborhood was revitalized from the inside out, and many residents embraced the name and message of Christ by faith.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Economic development. Mosaic took an abandoned Walmart,</li>
</ul>
<p>renovated it, and used it for worship ser vices. This helped the owner to provide additional rental space for businesses and to recreate community activity, jobs, and tax revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homeless connections. Mosaic purchased the necessary materials to create an opportunity for the working homeless living in a residential facility to join their worship ser vice through an internet campus. Members of the church host the weekly worship time, build relationships, and serve the families living in this unique space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community engagement. They launched Vine and Village, a</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>501(c)(3) community development corporation, which helps improve the quality of life for people living in and around Little Rock’s university district.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic focus. By reviewing its developmental strategy in the</li>
</ul>
<p>summer of 2010, Mosaic redefined the scope of its missional engagement to four areas: compassion, children, women, and freedom.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Mosaic is a multiethnic and economically diverse church established by men and women seeking to know God and to make him known through the pursuit of both unity and diversity for the sake of the 316 Church Profiles gospel. Their missional commitment has been present from the very beginning as both cross-cultural and incarnational engagement in an everyday reality in an environment where diverse individuals are learning to walk, work, and worship God together as one in Christ.</p>
<p>Even though they have been missional for many years, the church experienced a renewed sense of purpose and understanding as they reconsidered what missional means. After teaching through a series called Missio Dei, the church began to describe themselves as multiethnic and missional, which incorporates both membership and purpose into their identity. In addition, Mosaic relaunched their life groups as missional communities to advance definable mission through these small group settings.</p>
<p>Mosaic believes that a healthy church is intrinsically missional and will embrace greater diversity over time. This is evident in their expression of compassion, mercy, and justice not only to those outside the church but also to those seeking unity inside the church. In the future, the church will continue to influence and assist existing denominations, networks, and individuals seeking to plant, grow, and develop healthy local churches.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sacrifice. They have witnessed the struggle to embrace suffering over comfort. This is true even in a church of ethnic and economic diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding privilege. It is important that some first recognize a privileged past in order to move beyond the colonialtype mentality of helping “those people.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust. As they seek to be missional and multiethnic, they have</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>found that trust is built more slowly over time when they engage others different from themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Humility. It is difficult for some to believe that their way is just</li>
</ul>
<p>one way to do something at any given moment and not always the best way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Economics. Ahealthy multiethnic church is economically diverse. This has made the church more dependent on nonmembers to supplement the annual budget.</li>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Colin is a construction worker from Mountain Lake, and he founded a nonprofit called trashwater. com to bring clean water to those in need. This idea started when he was preaching the gospel in Cairo, Egypt, and saw Egyptians drinking dirty water. He did not realize the magnitude of the problem until he saw two Egyptians go to the hospital from drinking bad water. The whole experience affected him and his team so much that when they came back to the States, they did research on the global water crisis and decided to take action.</p>
<p>This led to starting a nonprofit for bringing filtration systems to the people of Cairo, and now it has spread beyond Egypt to Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>

<p>Mountain Lake 2.0, in which they cast a vision for who they want to become in the next few years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifications. They make the standard for leadership low at</li>

<ul>
<li>Adoption. Every life group is a little church-plant that adopts</li>

<p>318 Church Profiles</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Mountain Lake is starting over. They were planted in the year 2000, and now they are moving toward becoming a new kind of church, “Mountain Lake 2.0.” This revitalization started a few years ago when the leaders became discontent with the way things were going in their church. They were successful at growing to around 2,000 people and baptized exactly 1,068 in only eight years (even in the Bible Belt!), yet they are discontent with spiritual depth in their church. So they are getting ready for the second decade of their church by completely revamping their “growth group” ministries, launching two churches in a neighboring county, and strengthening missional partnerships around the world. Closer to home, they are changing the way they think about church. They think of Mountain Lake not as an island but as a kingdom force for reaching the entire city of Cumming. In the future, they see a network of campuses and churches that all share missional DNA and have 90 percent of their members in biblical community.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Old wineskins. They had to let go of a few popular leaders who</li>
</ul>
<p>were not ready to make the shift, and hired new staff members who were ready for the change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance. After the church made some significant leadership</li>

<ul>
<li>Community. They have done well at getting people plugged</li>
</ul>
<p>into one of their “growth groups” quickly, but they want to move toward growing disciples in “life groups” deeply.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Tom is an older man at River Tree and a pharmicist by trade. He felt God draw him to start a missional community in his neighborhood.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he has made the habit of helping people in the community in seemingly random ways, like mowing a deserted property. He loves to fix things up for people; it’s his heart. One day he went to the city council to find out what he could do to help the area.</p>
<p>He said, “The church should be part of helping the town, and I want to know how we can be a part of that.” Through a series of events, he was able to help an older lady by repairing the gutters of her house, and now there is a missional community of twelve people helping Tom out with community projects in their area.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Curb time. The leaders at River Tree make time to sit down and</li>
</ul>
<p>talk with people one-on-one in order to help make the transition to being more missional.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vision casting. In their sermons and teaching, they are constantly casting a vision about where their church is going. The lead pastor, Greg Nettle, is always talking about movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permission giving. They equip and encourage people to pursue</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>their missional passions, without keeping them on a leash.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modeling. The leadership is becoming more and more missional. They are showing the people of the church how it is 320 Church Profiles done — not just in front of them but with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding. They have created a memorandum of understanding</p>
</li>

<p>through which they allocate funds for each missional community for projects and events that require money.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>River Tree is a church-plant from the 1960s, and their journey started with discontent — the way they were doing church was not really growing the kingdom. As they studied Scripture and evaluated their progress toward Jesus’ mission, they asked themselves whether they were being true to their understanding of the kingdom movement. After networking with other churches, they met with nine people from their church who were interested in missional communities. At first they hesitated to release these leaders, because they did not know what these communities would look like. But four of them were champing at the bit, so they went ahead and unleashed them. In the future, they envision a more chaotic and organic kind of growth — not necessarily a growth dependent on smooth marketing but a growth based on real life-change and kingdom work. While the future is unclear for them, they want to be a sending hub where believers are discipled and sent out.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Letting Go. They struggle to let go as they transition into becoming a movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity. While they know who they are, they find it challenging to know who they are becoming.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>One of Rock Harbor’s missional communities decided to fast from regular meals for a month and eat only rice and beans. Their goal was to raise money for their community. This group of forty people saved all the money that would have gone toward regular meals during that month, and after the month was over, they put together the money they had saved. The Holy Spirit led them to a significant need in the community, and they gave the money away. When the recipients asked why, they responded, “We didn’t know about this need when we started, but we knew God would reveal a need. You’re the need.” In an affluent area like Orange County, this was completely unexpected. Not only were those who had a need changed, but also one of the kids from the missional community was changed. He got so fired up that he and some of his schoolmates raised even more money for a need at their school. He caught the vision.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rhythm. Every context for missional communities is different,</li>
</ul>
<p>so they are thinking of development in terms of rhythms — they encourage people to pray and discern, engage in mission, assess and ask, “Is this sustainable and reproducible?”</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>they train their leaders in twos, with the expectation that they will branch at some point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstfruits. Ten percent of their church’s budget goes to mis-</li>
</ul>
<p>322 Church Profiles sional communities. But if the communities receive this money, they match the amount from their own pockets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement language. Their lead pastor always uses movement</li>

<p>language about vision, direction, and mission in order to create a shift that will last.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Story patio.” They post pictures and stories of missional successes on a patio outside their church.</p>

<p>Storytelling. They gather people together to imagine and catalyze missional ideas as a group.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Having begun in 1997, Rock Harbor was not always missional. They have always been volunteer driven. So this shift toward a missional movement was not a “big left turn,” one of their pastors said; rather it was a redirection of the overwhelming volunteer attitude in the church. Amajor shift for Rock Harbor happened when their “church on wheels,” which had been meeting in a senior center, was not able to meet in that place. They decided that instead of going to church, they were going to be the church. This gave them a glimpse of what they could be as a church. Their next shift happened under the mantra “Give yourself away,” which to them was a posture of everyday service in their hearts and lives. Perhaps the most pivotal shift in their journey as a church was when they had the opportunity to buy a large building across the street to expand their Sunday seating capacity. They bought it and turned it into a training center instead of more seating. This set their future trajectory away from being attractional and toward being missional. The only growth they have made room for are missional communities and new campuses. The future for Rock Harbor includes hundreds of missional communities out of which new campuses and new churches will be born.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy-in. During the summer months of 2010, they asked all their</li>
</ul>
<p>small groups to oscillate between simply meeting together and serving the community. The challenge was that only half of their small groups had bought into doing missional projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modeling. Their leaders have realized that this change is so significant that it is not just a collective change; it is a personal change. They are making an effort to change themselves as well as the church.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative. Believers at Rock Harbor are used to approaching</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the church staff for action in the church. This continues to be a challenge, but the church has found success in empowering the passionate to live out their own ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patience. Although they have some missional communities in</li>
</ul>
<p>place, they have pushed their major promotion back a year so they can have a healthier shift.</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Seacoast has several people who have adopted a city block in Charleston, South Carolina, to care for residents as they build relationships and help with needs that arise. They are crossing racial barriers to be a reconciling force in a segregated city. The group of people from Seacoast that is involved with this part of the city is made up of predominantly white suburbanites, and they are spending time in a black urban neighborhood in Charleston — the seventh most dangerous city in the United States. The police stopped by to tell the church that since they started coming to the area, crime has dropped 25 percent.</p>
<p>Through their involvement in the city, they have had the opportunity to help one little boy who needed surgery for a cleft palate. The church 324 Church Profiles paid for everything: the surgery, the transportation, and the follow-up care. Seacoast is bringing reconciliation and peace to one of the most segregated and violent places in the country.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storytelling. On Sunday mornings, the staff at Seacoast intentionally give examples of and use new language for mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education. They spend time educating their leaders and their</p>
</li>

<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Seacoast began as a church-plant in 1988, but the idea of missional movement is a more recent one for them. It began when GeoffSurratt and his wife, Sherry, attended two church-planting conferences in Europe through Leadership Network. It was through conversations with European leaders that they realized how important the work of missional communities could be in the States. At the time, they did not know many people in the States who were thinking about missional communities. Their missional ideas really took off when the church went through Saddleback Church’s “40 Days of Community,” in which Seacoast encouraged all their small groups to have an outward-focused community project. This made a radical shift in their small group DNA. Instead of being just small groups, they became small groups with a mission. Then four years ago, Seacoast did something as a collective whole — they created the Dream Center in North Charleston, which became the biggest free medical clinic in the city.</p>
<p>They are not just about medicine at the Dream Center, though; they also share the gospel as they meet physical needs. Their small groups and church as a whole are focusing more and more on mission. It has become so important to them that they are reorganizing their church structure around missional communities. In the future, they envision the twelve existing campuses of Seacoast becoming networks of churches which are made of missional communities.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communication. Just like with any shift in a church, communicating the meaning and implications of being missional has been a struggle for them as they try to redefine themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contextualization. They have been wrestling through mission</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and discipleship in their context. In regard to mission, they are asking the question, what does missional mean in Charleston?</p>
<p>And then, how does discipleship work through our mission here?</p>

<h2>Stories Jeff, a pastor at Soma Communities, formed a missional community reaching out to his neighbors. Through BBQs and parties, he and his wife struck up a relationship with another couple from the area.</h2>
<p>Over a period of months building relationships and throwing parties with neighbors, Jeff invited a couple to serve with their missional community. They were helping restore a widow’s home. The yard was overgrown with blackberry bushes, to the point where no one could even walk through it. Working on this project bonded everyone together, and their friendship grew deeper. They ended up going on vacation together on the coast soon after, and when they were eating one night, the couple told them, “We see a light in your life. Tell us more about what you believe.” Through a series of events, Jeff and his wife told them the whole redemptive story of God, from Genesis to 326 Church Profiles Revelation. Eventually this couple joined the church and placed faith in Jesus. Now the husband is helping lead a missional community and has invited some of his friends as well.</p>
<p>Nicky, the elderly widow from the same story, ended up becoming a Christian through their work on her home. After they cleaned her house up, they opened their home to her, sharing a meal with her at least once a week. She kept so much clutter in her house that while they cleaned up her house, she lived out of her van. When the van broke down, Jeff and his family let her use their van for a while, and eventually their missional community paid to have her van fixed. She came over to their house crying one night because of troubles with a man. Jeff was able to tell her about the love of the man Jesus, and through a series of events, she became a Christian. What started as a small group of people helping a widow became a growing missional community.</p>
<p>Amusician/songwriter from Soma created a songwriters’ forum where a few songwriters trained up people from their city to write and record music. The songwriters’ group practiced writing songs together, wrote songs independently, and even showcased their music together. Over time, the group began to develop relationships with a variety of people. They decided to put on a ten-week writing forum called “The Story of God,” where they wrote songs based on ten major stories from Genesis to Revelation. As they critiqued and crafted their songs, the group shared the gospel with people in the pub who were listening. What started as a writers’ club turned into a thriving community. The songwriters’ group has to turn people away because they have too many people who want to be a part of it.</p>
<h2>Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coaching. Every missional community leader has a coach. Each</li>
</ul>
<p>year, the coaches develop a plan for the leader, each member, and the group as a whole for how they can engage in mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training. They train their leaders like they would train missionaries. All training at Soma is done “in ministry on mission and in community.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apprenticing. One of the two core commitments of missional</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>communities at Soma is that when they begin a group, they establish the apprentice who will eventually branch off to form a new community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus in mission. The second core commitment for Soma</li>
</ul>
<p>groups is that they commit to reach a specific people group.</p>
<p>Every missional community has an unreached people group they are reaching.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bottom-up planting. Their church-planting strategy is that new</li>
</ul>
<p>church-plants emerge from missional communities and not the other way around.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commissioning. When a group branches, the new community</li>
</ul>
<p>is commissioned for a new people group.</p>
<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Soma has been on a mission since they were planted seven years ago, but they are still growing and changing. From the beginning, they have been a church of missional communities, starting with just four, and now they have thirty missional communities from Tacoma, Seattle, Boise, and San Diego. Their vision is that missional communities would continue to be the primary life force of the church and that out of these groups, “new expressions of the church” would emerge and gain some form of independence. The shift they are making now is to be a more apostolic movement in which every believer is a church planter and every church is a church-planting church. In the next five years, they want to have missional communities in every major city on the West Coast. Then, in twenty to thirty years, they envision these types of missional communities in every major city in North America.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contextualization. Soma has a threefold template for ministry — the gospel, the people of God, and the everyday rhythms of life. These are the focus of training and mission. The challenge for their communities is working out each of these in their specific contexts as they target certain people groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priesthood of believers. In their efforts toward being a missional</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>movement, they have wrestled with the question, what would it look like if every member of the body of Christ actually was a minister of the gospel?</p>

<h2>Stories</h2>
<p>Atwelve-year-old middle school student at Westridge realized that not all kids her age are as fortunate as she is. She went to an affluent school and realized that some do not have backpacks and school materials. So, with the help of her family, she started a nonprofit called Fresh Hope, which raises money for backpacks and school supplies for underresourced kids in the community.</p>
<p>Aconstruction worker at Westridge who had done very well in his business left his job to pursue a missional building project — a community center called Warehouse of Hope. This building serves as a food and clothing pantry for the community to fulfill medical, counseling, and legal needs. The church sends volunteers to this site every week.

<h2>Journey to a Movement</h2>
<p>Their journey toward a movement is best represented by their annual community projects. They have been a church since 1997, but it was not until four years ago that this movement was awakened in their hearts. They have been involved in mission globally, but it started to become widespread in their campuses when they rallied their people to do an extreme home makeover. The needs of the community were greater than just those of one house, so they decided to do dozens of small projects instead of one large one. The next year, they not only extended the amount of projects to 250 but also included eight other churches in their efforts. Just last year, they had ten thousand people from different churches help with 500 projects, and now they are looking at more than eighty churches working on 875 projects this year! In just four years, they have seen amazing growth and spontaneous projects emerge from their people. As they look forward to the next five years, they want to have five venues, an online campus, and continued growth in community projects.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Technology. Westridge wants to utilize this ever-changing tool</li>
</ul>
<p>as they reach the world around them, but their imagination in this area of advancement is still in the early stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alignment. They have found that it takes time to get the missional flywheel moving. It takes patience, consistency, and time.</p>

<p>We did test this idea out with two of the foremost researchers in America (we</p>

</ol>
<p>can’t give names, because they’re simply venturing opinion, but you all know them); they said — averaged out across America — we can be relatively certain the numbers are at least fifty-fifty. That is, what we are currently doing might have appeal to up to 50 percent of the population but not beyond that.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>We have to face this: The combination of resources, timing, leadership ability, and talent and charisma that come together to make a successful megachurch simply doesn’t happen for most churches. In fact, research by Leadership Network, the peak body servicing megachurches in America, indicates there are twelve hundred churches greater than two thousand in the U.S. This segment has grown significantly over the last ten years. But when you consider that there are around four hundred thousand churches in the U.S., with the average attendance of eighty, then one gains the real perspective. The overwhelming majority of churches won’t be able to produce a successful megachurch. And it’s not that they haven’t tried; they have read the books, attended the conferences, and so on. Forty years of church-growth theory and practice in America has not fundamentally altered the decline.</p>

<p>An organizational paradigm can be defined as “a world view, a frame of reference, or a set of assumptions, usually implicit, about what sorts of things make up the world, how they act, how they hang together, and how they may be known. This world view is composed of three interrelated components: (1) a way of looking at the world which creates an image of the subject matter about the world’s phenomena and constructs a system of beliefs; (2) a way of doing things that provides the methods and instruments needed to apply fundamental beliefs to internal and external realities; and (3) an interaction among human agents to support both the belief system and the normative behavior, including social networks that support the adoption and practice of a particular paradigm.” Hasan Simsek, “Organizational Change As Paradigm Shift: Analysis of the Change Process in a Large, Public University,” Journal of Higher Education 65, no. 6 (November – December 1994): 670.</p>
