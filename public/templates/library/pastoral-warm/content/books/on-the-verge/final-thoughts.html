<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>New understandings of doing ministry must be created with each new generation for the church’s mission to move forward.... The day of the professional minister is over. The day of the missionary pastor has come.</p>
<h2>— KENNON CALLAHAN,</h2>
<p>—C H U R C H C O N S U L T A N T In this book, we’ve attempted to point you toward a new, and yet remarkably ancient, vision of the church as apostolic movement. We have done so in the sincere belief that unless we can somehow access the potency of this way of being Jesus’ people, we’ll simply continue the sad decline of Christianity throughout the Western world. Part of the way we recover this way of being is by reactivating the latent missional coding of the church, namely, Apostolic Genius.</p>
<p>We are hopeful. Mainly because we believe that Apostolic Genius is already latent in the people of God and that it ought not to be something so utterly foreign to us that we can’t recover it. We as much have to remember it as activate it, as Paul writes to Timothy: “For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you” (2 Tim. 1:6). We are also deeply hopeful because as far as we can observe, there are real signs that the church as we know it is beginning to shift toward the verge of this apostolic future.</p>
