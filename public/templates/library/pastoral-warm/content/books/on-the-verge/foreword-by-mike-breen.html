<h1>Foreword by Mike Breen</h1>
<p>I love watching sports news on TV. And the kinds of sports programs I love the most are the ones with a dual anchor. The two voices provide me with interest, humor, and the right kind of depth that I am looking for in my daily sports fix. Having two voices in Dave and Alan’s book has a similar effect. As you consider the issues of developing a “Verge” church, you hear with great clarity how both the attractional and the missional are needed in equal measure. If we are to build strong centers of mission-churches that resource networks of missional congregations and communities, we need the strongest attractional forces and the most vibrant missional impulses to be present.</p>
<p>As you read through the text of this serious and yet surprisingly readable study, I know you will be struck by the depth of what is offered. Science tells us that our depth perception comes through our binocular vision. The binocular vision of this book provides a perspective that I’ve not seen anywhere else.</p>
<p>As we move farther into the twenty-first century, the church will need to engage with the necessity of recalibrating our expectations of church. If we can maximize the potential of the twentieth-century church that found its final flower in the megachurch and multisite movements, we will offer a great ser vice to the church of the new millennium. This will be achieved as the church shapes itself to respond to the missional impulse. Attractional churches that become missional begin to look like movements. If we can capture the heart and vitality of the reborn global missional impetus, we will see high-impact congregations transforming their wider communities.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, Professor Eddie Gibbs, has said that the church in the twentieth century had achieved great things, but one of its sad legacies was the growing schism between missiology and ecclesiology. In his opinion, this led to a missionless church and a churchless mission. What Alan and Dave are offering is the possibility that the twenty-first century might be quite different: by reconnecting the forces of attraction and mission, we see something that is greater than the sum of its two parts. We see a church that is much more like the one Jesus intended. He was the most attractive man who ever walked the planet, and his life was a constant expression of God’s mission to the world. His church should therefore be the visible manifestation of his life.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to read this book more than once. My expectation is that you will find that the two voices, like the warp and woof in any good fabric, merge into a single entity. The Lord’s voice, we are told, is a voice of many waters. As you read this book, I’m sure you will find that the voices of these two great leaders become one and you hear the voice of Jesus inviting you to join his mission and love the church he is building.</p>
