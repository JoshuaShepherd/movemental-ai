<h1>Foreword by Reggie Mc Neal</h1>
<p>We are living in a time when God appears to be changing the conversation he is having with the church. The dialogue revolves around the church’s self-understanding of its mission in the world. Missional church is the buzzword for this conversation. While there are some nuances and various dialects of missional being spoken, widespread agreement exists around a core expression of what it means to be missional. The missional church engages the community with the intent of being a blessing. It looks for ways to connect with the world beyond the walls of church real estate and programming.</p>
<p>For many congregations, this external focus finds expression through ser vice, not more “ser vices.” The congregation becomes the church not just in the community but for the community. Crossdomain collaboration with other sectors of the city enables the church to begin to address some of the challenging issues that threaten the welfare of the city. Typically, existing congregations are entering the missional movement across this threshold.</p>
<p>More recently, a new expression of missional church has captured the attention of those of us who are tracking the missional movement. It is the rise of missional communities. This development signals the arrival of a new life form in the taxonomy of church life. The emergence of missional communities is part of the Spirit’s response to deploying the church in an increasingly postcongregational era.</p>
<p>Translated into English, that means the church is figuring out a way to be present in populations that are not susceptible to becoming church people (people who align their spiritual journeys with the goals and rhythms of organized congregational church). Yet these people are spiritually inquisitive and open to relationship with Jesus and with other believers. It is just that their lifestyle or their employment or their personal interests don’t intersect with the spiritual scripting of congregational church.</p>
<p>Missional communities take the church beyond engaging the com- 14 Foreword by Reggie Mc Neal munity. These life forms are church lived out in the community. These missional communities are all the church that many people will ever know — or ever need. They are real church, not church lite or quasi church.</p>
<p>Establishing missional communities can become a key part of the missional strategy of existing congregations. In thebook before you, Dave Ferguson and Alan Hirsch explore this possibility, specifically in the context of how mega-congregations can implement and fastforward this approach to mission.</p>
<p>There can never be a timelier conversation than the one God wants to have! And there could never be two more qualified voices to further the dialogue. Dave and Alan embody the right approach to the discovery of new life: a sense of wonder, a spirit of curiosity, and a genuine stewardship that what they have uncovered not just belongs to them but also has been entrusted to them to be shared with others.</p>
<p>I am thankful they have invited you and me into the conversation.</p>
