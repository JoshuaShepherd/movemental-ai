<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<h2>Out-of-the-Box Innovation</h2>
<p>At first, the new thing is rarely as good as the old thing was.</p>
<p>But if you need the alternative to be better than the status quo from the very start, you'll never begin.</p>
<h2>— SETH GODIN, MARKETING GURU</h2>
<p>"We are going to end our church service early today."</p>
<p>Very seldom had I heard those words come out of the mouth of a pastor. And what I was about to hear next I had never heard before: "I'm kicking you all out!" Now he really had my attention.</p>
<p>He continued, "There is a big citywide festival starting this morning in our town, and I want you to get out of this church building so we join the rest of our friends and neighbors." A concluding prayer was said, and the next thing I knew, we all quickly exited the doors of the church facility and were listening to good music, eating great food, and enjoying ourselves with several thousand neighbors on a gorgeous sunny day.</p>
<p>As I look back on that experience, I'm struck by how a simple act by that leader could feel so remarkably radical. Why did it feel that way? It goes back to our understanding of innovation. How many times have you heard a leader say something about needing to get people out of the church's four walls and into the community? While having these thoughts are good signs that the missional imagination is at work, imagination isn't enough. Imagination is only the first step.</p>
<p>We have to take our churches through the shift process that begins with imagination and results in innovation.</p>
<p>And remember, the equation that gets us innovation is: imagination x implementation = innovation. That's what happened when the pastor kicked us out of church — and thus out of the box — that Sunday. He made a decision that the church would no longer just talk about living beyond the four walls but would get their butts out of the sanctuary seats and into the city square. That seemingly simple act was radical because it gave us all a glimpse of an out-of-the-box culture and what it would look like to make the shift from imagination to innovation.</p>
<p>The shift in ethos and practice toward out-of-the-box innovation had been in the making for some time in this church. Over the last several years, this pastor had already begun to reorient what happened inside the church "box" for their neighbors and mission. They hired two part-time chefs on their staff, not to serve them but to make eight hundred meals every week for the homeless in their community. They opened up their facility to be used as a gallery where artists could display their crafts. I was there on a weekend that a young artist in his late teens sold his very first painting. You think he'll ever forget where he sold his first painting? No. He will always remember that church.</p>
<p>They also used their box as an upscale concert venue and the home of several twelve-step recovery groups open to the entire community.</p>
<p>And before the pastor ever kicked his church out of the building, he gave himself the boot. After preaching on Sunday mornings, he would spend time with his family in the afternoon and then hang out at the local pub on Sunday nights. It was there that he got a chance to talk to guys about life, work, and spiritual things; these were guys he never got to talk to on Sunday morning. So he went to the owner and told him he had an idea for bringing in a few more customers: Pub Church. The owner said that if it brought in more business, great.</p>
<p>So the pastor began to put posters up all over the neighborhood. The tagline in the middle cracks me up: "Two Beer Service Every Sunday." This pastor's Pub Church led the way in out-of-the-box innovation.</p>
<p>During 2007 and 2008, my friends at Outreach magazine published a list of the twenty-five most innovative churches. Because Community Christian Church is a multisite church, uses a lot of creativity in the weekend celebration services, and loves technology, we would frequently be on this list of churches. Now, you might be thinking it didn't hurt that I was also a part of the panel that helped select the most innovative churches, but I couldn't nominate my own church! While serving on that panel, it was my observation that much of what was considered innovative was actually in-the-box innovation.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Much of what was identified as innovation was literally happening within the four-walled boxes of the church facilities.</p>
<p>In 2009, at the encouragement of pastor and author Tony Morgan, who spearheaded this project, they quit listing innovative churches and started focusing more on particular innovations. When I asked Outreach magazine's editor Lindy Lowry for her observations, she said, "Having worked on the 'Twenty-Five Most Innovative Churches' list, it does seem that a high degree of the innovation is happening within the walls of the church. Of course, we have discovered and highlighted churches that are thinking creatively about what it takes to reach people outside the walls, but we definitely need more churches with that mindset, more churches that will take risk and ask, 'What is good news for this community, and how can we bring it to them?'" To successfully make this paradigmatic shift to become a Verge church, it requires a leadership willing to kick people out of their steepled boxes. It requires leadership that pushes others beyond discussion about mission to actually doing mission. These leaders refuse to make mission merely an academic interest; instead it becomes their first thought every morning. That is the type of leadership it takes to create an out-of-the-box innovative culture.</p>
<p>Darrin Patrick, lead pastor at Journey Church, has a bias for action and is moving his people out of their multiple boxes in the St. Louis area. Journey Church was not started with the intention of being a megachurch; it was started in Darrin's home to reach the people around him. As he began to reach people in his neighborhood, this new church established three values: mission, community, and beauty.</p>
<p>Over the next ten years, the church grew at a very rapid pace.</p>
<p>This was good news and bad news. The good news was, they were now reaching about three thousand people every week at four different locations. But the bad news was, approximately 60 percent of those people were from other churches in the St. Louis metro area. It was time for them to return to where they started: reaching their neighborhoods, and the core value of mission. As Darrin and his staff team led this back-to-the-future shift, the result was out-of-the-box innovation.</p>
<p>Make contact: relationships are critical to mission. We need to ensure the good disciples have meaningful contact with non-Christians and don't spend all their time organizing the bad disciples.</p>
<p>In a nearby Bellville neighborhood, a Journey member opened a thrift shop in a storefront, with the support of two community groups, to help serve indigent people in that community. Then there was Josh Willis and his wife, who led the way by getting out of their box and moving their family into an underresourced neighborhood in Forest Park. The Willises established a house church and began to volunteer in the local daycare center that supports a lot of single moms. Because of their leadership, others began to move to the neighborhood, and a couple hundred people began volunteering to do repairs on workdays for the local daycare. Meanwhile, another Journey attender, named Joe, didn't feel the need to move to a new place but was called to the people right around him. Joe owns a used-car lot and is using it as a gathering place on Wednesday nights to bring together a very diverse group of about thirty people from his neighborhood who are all taking next steps on their way back to God.</p>
<p>Once a church makes the shift of recognizing their Apostolic Genius and allowing it to permeate their ethos and practice, it's in a place where constant and ongoing out-of-the-box innovation is very possible. But establishing this out-of-the-box culture takes time and care. There are no instant cultures. New churches don't have a culture.</p>
<p>Culture is the byproduct of consistent behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nine Characteristics of Out-of-the-Box Cultures</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>1. Beta, Not Better</h3>
<p>Arguably two of the most innovative companies around today are Apple and Google. Both are exceptional brands and extremely smart companies, but they innovate in distinctly different ways. Let's compare: Apple gets a product 100 percent complete before they drop it into the market. Steve Jobs gets up and announces the new thing and bam! It hits the market and is ready for consumption. If they talk about it, it's ready to be consumed. Google, on the other hand, drops a beta into the world. It's an unfinished product, with all kinds of improvements needed to make it a success.</p>
<p>Apple innovates entirely in secret. Its innovation is pioneered in a closed system and done behind closed doors. Google still pioneers, but it only comes up with the prototype. The users actually help Google finish the product by their use and feedback. Google listens to the people as they are innovating and refining the product. It is an open system — crowd sourcing, if you like. Apple rarely has failures, but they have a very limited product line compared with Google's. Google has more failures than Apple, but they have a lot more diversity in their scope of innovation.</p>
<p>These are two very different approaches to innovation. The point here is that Google is not afraid to put an incomplete product out there and ask people to help them improve it. They are saying, "We don't know what will work best until you tell us." They are telling us they want to listen. There is a lot of risk out there too when you do this. Some products don't fly; they don't even crawl. And failure is very public in this model. However, they have made incredibly successful products as well, like Google Search, Books, and Gmail.</p>
<p>Verge churches have used the Apple approach in the past to get better and better. However, these churches aren't content with a better version of church; they want to see a movement. And movement requires that you're constantly engaging new cultural contexts with the gospel and seeing new innovative forms of mission emerge. One of the ways many Verge churches sustain innovative cultures is through pilots.</p>
<p>The Austin Stone Church periodically brings people together to simply ask them this question in a variety of ways: "What would it look like for you to incarnate the gospel where you live and work?" Then they ask them to dream without any fear of failure. Next they ask them to not just imagine but implement, with complete understanding that some of the pilot projects will work and some won't.</p>
<p>Verge churches look more like Google than Apple. Verge churches understand it's not just about a "better" innovation; it's about many "beta" innovations.</p>
<h3>2. Trusting and Trustworthy</h3>
<p>Verge churches are often recognized for their willingness to take risks and for the speed at which they make changes. We seldom get beyond our awe for their swiftness and fearlessness. The reason why Verge churches can go so fast is because all their energy is full-speed toward the goal of the mission, and there is very little sideways energy spent checking up on each other. Why? Verge churches are composed of teams of people that are trusting and trustworthy. The people on these teams assume the best of one another and move forward with complete confidence in each other. The trust is so high that even when someone breaks the rules, the first assumption about that teammate is that they have only done so for the good of the mission. The reason why the trust is so high on these teams is that on a daily basis they demonstrate to one another that they are trustworthy. This is accomplished through their tireless work ethic, their uncompromising commitment to their shared values, and a shared belief that together they will accomplish the vision.</p>
<h3>3. Permission Is Assumed and Forgiveness Is Expected</h3>
<p>The general reaction after spending some time in and around a Verge church is something like this: "These people get away with murder... they get to do whatever they want! If I was here, I would be unstoppable too!" You're right, and that is what God wants for you and your church — to be an unstoppable movement. These churches have created cultures where the staff has permission to spend money, allocate resources, make decisions, and schedule their own time — it is all assumed to be okay. If staff were to ask permission, the reaction would either be a look of shock or laughing out loud. They don't ask for permission; it is assumed. When too much money is spent, a decision oversteps the boundaries, or protocol is not followed, forgiveness is expected. For those who have never been in a Verge church culture, it is like a trip to a foreign country.</p>
<p>The culture that is created by the staff is a microcosm of the rest of the church. The rest of the church feels free to initiate new endeavors at work or in their neighborhood. Every person knows there is a people group or a place they're called to reach. It never occurs to them that ministry or mission is something that needs to get approval.</p>
<p>And when they make mistakes and can't figure out what to do next, the staff is a safe place to get resourcing and encouragement. If you asked the average member of a Verge church, "Do you need to get permission to do that?" they would respond with a raised eyebrow and a turned head and say, "Why?" In Verge churches, permission is assumed and forgiveness expected.</p>
<h3>4. Hurry Up... Wait</h3>
<p>Verge churches go fast. Real fast. Faster than you think. But they also know how to go slow. Real slow. Grinding-to-a-halt slow. It's this hurry-up-and-wait culture that cultivates the two most important habits for sustaining an innovative culture.</p>
<p>First, creative cultures place a high value on accomplishment through collaboration. When they see opportunity, they sprint as a team toward the finish line. Balance is not a word that would describe the lifestyle of a Verge church, but mission accomplished is!</p>
<p>Second, creative cultures also find ways to make time for solitude.</p>
<p>The great artist Pablo Picasso told us, "Without great solitude no serious work is possible." So while they move together at breakneck speed, they also find time in the daily, monthly, and annual rhythms to "be still, and know that I am God" (Ps. 46:10). These times of solitude and silence aren't just a backdrop or an empty cup waiting to be filled.</p>
<p>Silence is its own kind of perception and receptivity. This more subtle sense of perception can only be clarified when the noisier perceptions fall silent. It's a lot like learning to see in the dark. At first everything appears totally black. But if you're patient, you can, little by little, begin to see shapes. Silence and solitude allow us to see, in new ways, things that were hidden from us before.</p>
<p>If you look at the rhythm of Verge community life, it is filled with the practice of high-energy celebration as well as the practice of retreat into solitude and silence. The routine of hurry up and wait is what nurtures their innovative culture.</p>
<h3>5. Fail Forward Fast</h3>
<p>Verge churches have cultures in which the heroes are not just those who are successful in the mission but also those who take great risks for the mission. These churches are far from risk-adverse; instead they have created cultures with a new hero system that honors those who risk the most. In that kind of environment there is no fear of failure, only the fear of not having risked. John Wooden, arguably the greatest college basketball coach of all time, said, "When you punish your people for making a mistake or falling short of a goal, you create an environment of extreme caution, even fearfulness. In sports it's called 'playing not to lose' — a formula that often brings on defeat." These churches are always on the offensive and playing to win. Verge churches celebrate failure knowing that if a few things are not failing, they have not risked enough. And when they do fail, they bring the people back into the community with an ovation that acknowledges their faithfulness and willingness to risk it all for the cause.</p>
<p>The ethos and risk-taking spirit of Verge churches is exemplified in a story that takes place toward the end of Paul's life, in Acts 21. He was at sea and landed in Tyre, where prophets in a local ecclesia had for Paul a dire warning: don't go to Jerusalem!</p>
<p>In Ptolemais, Philip the evangelist's four daughters prophesied and Agabus the prophet corroborated: "Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, 'The Holy Spirit says, "In this way the [Jewish leaders in] Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles."' When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem" (Acts 21:11 – 12).</p>
<p>What do you suppose Paul did? It seemed the Holy Spirit was the author of this warning after all! "Paul answered, 'Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus'" (Acts 21:13).</p>
<p>Verge churches are not afraid to fail. They fail falling forward.</p>
<p>And they fail forward fast!</p>
<h3>6. Love the Edge</h3>
<p>If home is where the heart is, then the home of a Verge church is on the edge. The edge is the point of the next and newest missional engagement; this is where Verge churches feel the most comfortable.</p>
<p>Most churches prefer the safety of the center and the comfort of their steepled facilities, but the people in Verge churches resent the thought that they might get left behind at the old, the familiar, or the established. They are passionate about church planting. They are addicted to entrepreneurial endeavors. They have a bias toward new things.</p>
<p>Both the staff and the people who make up Verge churches would rather go and start the next new thing (missional community, campus, or church-plant) than be a part of the existing larger and more successful thing. They have created cultures that love the edge, and it's on the edge that innovation occurs. If for no other reason than their preferred proximity to the edge, they are always in the middle of the latest innovation.</p>
<h3>7. They Put Their Money Where Your Mouth Is!</h3>
<p>The stuff that other leaders and churches only talk about, Verge churches will invest resources into. They put dollars, time, and people behind making things happen. They aren't naive enough to think that throwing money at something will bring it to life. But they also apply stakeholding principles and invest their best people and assets in their greatest opportunities.</p>
<p>In an effort to sustain an out-of-the-box culture, River Tree Christian Church in Massillon, Ohio, doesn't just talk about it; they budget it! This church offers a financial grant to incentivize communities of people to meet in off-site spaces with the mission of reaching out in that context. The elders of the church enter into a "memorandum of understanding" with the leader of that missional community to determine how much funding is needed and how it will be spent. Perhaps the most successful example from River Tree was Jason Lantz, who served on their staff in the area of college and career groups. Jason lived in Canton, about eight miles away from River Tree's first site in Massillon. Consequently, all of the eleven missional communities he started were in Canton. These communities started working together under the banner of "Love Canton," with a vision of bringing transformation to community. The leadership of River Tree saw the potential in Jason and his passion for Canton, so they gave him complete autonomy and funded his salary, just as they do in overseas missions.</p>
<p>While other churches are still talking about it, Verge churches are putting their money behind it!</p>
<h3>8. Everyone Gets to Play</h3>
<p>Many churches have created a missional apartheid — we allow the professionals and a few of the very gifted amateurs to participate in the mission, and the rest have to stay on the outskirts of missional engagement. Verge churches have cultures in which the next great idea can come from anyone! Verge churches believe that God has a great idea about how to use everyone! We are all born with a craving for mission and "good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do" (Eph. 2:10).</p>
<p>The remarkable story of Monroe Circle Community Center started when two women from Granger Community Church, Jody and Sarah, went on a mission trip to Cabrini Green, a public housing development on the near north side of Chicago, to do a vacation Bible school. They just fell in love with the kids. On their way back to Indiana, they realized there were kids they could serve in very similar conditions but much closer to home in South Bend, Indiana. The two women went to their pastor, Rob Wegner, and asked how they could get involved. Rob sent them to the Housing Authority to find out what was happening in South Bend. It turned out that no one was doing anything there, and many of the churches that had been involved in the past would briefly do something and then leave. Jody and Sarah began meeting with seven kids around a picnic table, and after eighteen months they were serving and loving more than one hundred kids a week. Other ladies got involved and started meeting with moms to build into them as well.</p>
<p>In the same area where Jody and Sarah were meeting with the children, there was a food pantry run by some elderly people. Volunteers from Granger Community Church rebooted the food pantry, so that it was built around values of community and connection. The older people who ran the food pantry were so impressed with the volunteers, they sold them the large building for a single dollar. The whole team from Granger went to work rehabbing the facility that now houses the food pantry, space for kids programs, a stage with room for celebration services, and much more. Thus the birth of Monroe Circle Community Center, which is now under the leadership of Le Roy King, who grew up across the street. What is emerging is a new monastic model in which church is fused with every aspect of life (education, health care, commerce, and so on). Granger Community Church is committed to the people of Monroe Circle for the long term, and over the next decade is dreaming about entire family legacies being transformed. I believe it's going to happen! It's already begun. It started as a grassroots initiative led by two women with a passionate love for God's kids.</p>
<p>Jesus said his kingdom is like yeast in the dough; a little bit of leaven is an unstoppable force that raises the whole loaf. That chemical reaction is happening at Monroe Circle.</p>
<p>Apostolic movements not only support the priesthood of every believer but actively practice that belief. Verge churches don't just celebrate the big wins led by paid staff; they also celebrate the smaller stories of innovative missional gains by passionate followers. Verge churches have created cultures that are intentional about commissioning the artist who plays in the pub in front of five people, as well as the church planter starting the next new site with five hundred people.</p>
<p>A Verge church celebrates a mom who starts a postabortion recovery group in her home as much as the missionary team returning home from a third world country. These cultures recognize that everyone is needed and that everyone gets to play in the kingdom of God.</p>
<h3>9. No R&#x26;D Department</h3>
<p>In larger churches, the temptation will be to create a department and silo the research and development regarding missional engagement. In smaller churches, when people want to experiment, it will be tempting for the leadership to turn their heads the other way and ignore it until they hear about the outcome. While individual experimentation or the creation of a taskforce may be a good short-term strategy for making the shift to movemental thinking and behaving, it doesn't reflect the innovative culture of a Verge church.</p>
<p>Acts 2 describes the first apostolic movement: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.</p>
<p>Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved" (Acts 2:42 – 47).</p>
<p>I can't help but notice two words in that section of Scripture: everyone and all. It wasn't just a small percentage of the church engaged and living out mission. It was enough that it appeared to the writer Luke that everyone was in on it; they were all a part of God's holy experiment.</p>
<p>Verge churches don't have a department set aside for research and development. Instead these churches consider themselves the research and development department of the kingdom of God. They don't mind saying, "Let's give it a go." Some say they have no sense of responsibility, but Verge church leaders would say they are permission-giving and aren't afraid to get it wrong. Getting it wrong means they are one experiment closer to getting it right.</p>
<p>In order to sustain an innovative culture that consistently mobilizes people for mission, it will take these kinds of behaviors on the part of the leadership. And remember why all this talk about innovation. It isn't about being cool, trendy, or new! It's about getting the church out of the box of its building and into the fabric of the community and the life of its neighbors. The point of the whole shift process that starts with reimagining the church as an apostolic movement and then creates a culture with routine missional practices is to get the church going and not just coming!</p>
<p>Once you're successful in creating a culture of innovation where God has a dream for every life and where the next great idea can come from anyone, you're on the verge of great momentum and, in time, an apostolic movement. To mobilize people into existing missional ministry opportunities requires a simple infrastructure of relational care with proper spans of control. However, when people come with new and creative ideas to accomplish the mission, you will need a repeatable process so you don't overwhelm the leadership and you honor those people who are presenting the new ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Process for Creating Out-of-the-Box Culture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten million people tuned in to watch Nightline introduce the world to a company called IDEO, one of the leading design and innovation firms in the world. Nightline had agreed to feature IDEO, if they could show their viewers how to do innovation. IDEO founder David Kelley agreed. Their assignment: "Take something old and familiar and completely redesign it in just five days." They chose a shopping cart as their project. The whole world got to see their innovative process for creating a new kind of shopping cart (which took just five days) in that thirty-minute show. The process for innovation was amazing!</p>
<p>IDEO's assignment, taking something old and familiar and completely redesigning it, sounds like a very familiar challenge to every church leader. But in a recent survey, less than 20 percent of church leaders said that their church was one that could foster innovation.</p>
<p>We are convinced that if churches have a leadership that values and practices innovation and helps create a culture that fosters innovation, there is still one missing piece: churches need a process that creates a clear path for missional ideas to be implemented and lived out. With a clear innovative process, you can train ordinary people to be extraordinary innovators. Without a clear innovative process, you will end up with incremental change or fantasy ideas that are never implemented.</p>

<p>Turning Ideas Into I.D.E.A.s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kim and Maria Hammond, along with their three boys, just moved into a new development with lots of young families, many of whom were lower-income. Kim is a big guy with a huge heart for mission, and Maria is a beautiful mother with a tender heart for people far from God. A quick study of their neighborhood and a nearby park revealed that kids had to travel outside their neighborhood to play Little League baseball, and many couldn't afford it. This got Kim and Maria's missional imagination working. Their idea: what if we started a baseball league for elementary-age kids? It was an idea they believed would be good news to the neighborhood, and a way to build redemptive relationships.</p>
<p>So how do we help Kim and Maria take that idea and implement it? The following is a time-tested, simple, and reproducible process for turning an idea into an I.D.E.A. It's a handy acronym, but it's important — though the terms are fairly self-explanatory, a little explanation is in order.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Investigate</h2>
<p>The first step is to investigate and conduct the fact-finding needed to fully assess if this idea is something that would be considered good news in that context. In our case study with Kim and Maria, the very first task would be to gain a good understanding of where they now live and if a baseball league is something that would be received as good news in that neighborhood. Here are some of the questions we would ask in coaching them:</p>
<p><strong>"I" Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does your current context look like — what do we know, what don't we know?</li>
<li>What are the needs in this context?</li>
<li>What are the strengths of this context?</li>
<li>What does it look like to be good news in that setting?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Design</h2>
<p>Once we've done our investigation and believe that the idea is good news for that context, the second step is to design it for implementation. Once Kim and Maria's investigation proved there were many young families with children in their neighborhood who would welcome and contribute to a baseball league, the next step would be to help them think through how to get it started. Together we would paint a mental picture of how to implement this idea and what the future would look like when this idea was successfully working. The coaching conversation would include the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>"D" Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does the future look like if the problem is solved or this strength is accentuated?</li>
<li>What other ideas like this exist that we can learn from?</li>
<li>What is the best way to do this?</li>
<li>What can we pilot quickly, with little risk, to test our idea?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Experiment</h2>
<p>Once we've done our homework on contextualization and have designed what we believe to be ministry with the potential for transformation, it's time to experiment. The third step is experimentation and selecting the option or solution that holds the greatest promise, by conducting a pilot project to test the idea. Knowing that the community is supportive of a baseball league, Kim and Maria can design a pilot project that allows them to experiment and learn how to make this idea even better. They decided to host a half-day baseball camp where they would teach kids some fundamentals, followed by a pickup game. In a coaching conversation with them, we would ask these types of questions:</p>
<p><strong>"E" Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How will you test the idea?</li>
<li>What do you expect will happen during that experiment?</li>
<li>What is the scope of impact, and how will you measure it?</li>
<li>How will you know if your idea is successful?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 4: Adjust</h2>
<p>After the experiment, you will take the fourth step in the I.D.E.A. process: making adjustments. This is the step where you assess and tweak and where results are compared with expected outcomes. Once the necessary adjustments are made, you follow up with a redesign to improve the original idea. After the half-day baseball camp, Kim and Maria had learned a lot. They still believed that a baseball league would work, but now they had a better idea about how to make it work. Here are some questions we would work through in helping them adjust their original ministry idea:</p>
<p><strong>"A" Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What worked and why?</li>
<li>What didn't work and why?</li>
<li>What adjustments must be made?</li>
<li>What is the plan for redesigning?</li>
</ul>
<p>Investigate, design, experiment, and adjust are the universal common denominators to successful innovation. The beauty of the I.D.E.A. loop is that it can apply to any context and any church, thus opening up everyday innovation to every person.</p>
<p>Kim and Maria not only started a baseball league that in the first summer included fifty-plus kids and parents, but they also started several other community events. The result? Lost people are finding their way back to God, and the neighborhood is being transformed.</p>
<p>The mission of Jesus is being accomplished. None of this occurred in a steepled box on a Sunday morning. It is out-of-the-box innovation!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan's Response to "Out-of-the-Box Innovation"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently Dave and I were in conversation with some key denominational leaders. We talked about the need for innovation in the church, much as we have in the chapters you're reading at the moment.</p>
<p>At one point, one of the execs said that not all people can be innovators. To which I answered, "They could, if their lives depended on it." The truth is, human beings are incredibly creative. Given the right conditions, even the most seemingly ordinary person can come up with bright solutions. One could even read history as a series of events initiated and directed by certain innovations that shape social patterns, influence decisions, and so change the course of human history. The invention of the printing press is one such example. It's not too much to suggest that both the Renaissance and the Reformation were initiated by the availability of mass printing.1 And we all know how personal computing, the ubiquity of the internet, and the social media revolution are changing everything. Philosopher and communications theorist Marshall McLuhan was right: we invent our tools, and then our tools reinvent us.2</p>
<p>But innovation is as much science as it is art. It is not always dependent on the genius. To say this differently: what goes by the name of "genius" can be traced down to some common factors and understood in terms of networking and chaos theory. It can be learned, studied, and it certainly can be prompted by the right conditions.3 As we have seen in the previous chapter ("Innovate or Die"), these conditions are upon us.</p>
<p>Most innovation theorists now understand that innovation doesn't necessarily mean concocting something radically new, seemingly out of nowhere, but that new ideas and products arise out of combining different ideas from seemingly disparate areas of concern. The real key to innovation, then, comes from combining ideas drawn from a tumult of already existing, if separate, developments and ideas.</p>
<p>Researchers Francis Crick and James Watson cracked the DNA code by bringing together the sciences of genetics, physical chemistry, X-ray crystallography, and mathematics. Trying to unlock it from within the narrow scientific discipline of genetics alone produced no results — it could not; the answer had to come from outside the discipline.4 The printing press came about from combining the dissimilar technologies of the wine press and the coin punch! But it was precipitated by the sponsorship (and money) of the Catholic Church, who wanted to standardize some theological ideas in order to control freethinking!5 Who would have guessed how that would backfire! Cirque du Soleil opened up an entirely new market space (blue ocean) by blending opera and ballet with the circus format while eliminating star performers and animals.</p>
<p>The principle? Look near and far for possible answers, bring seemingly disparate things together, be playful and imaginative, look for answers outside your specialist interests, and think outside your overly developed institutional/Christendom box.</p>
<p>In Built to Last, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras offer some more ways to stimulate creativity and movement:6</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Good enough never is. Encourage a continual process of relentless self-improvement with the aim of doing better and better, forever into the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try a lot of stuff and keep what works. Try to develop high levels of action and experimentation — often unplanned and undirected — that produce new and unexpected paths of progress and enable visionary companies to adapt and develop.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As Dave has indicated, a climate of change can be promoted by a preparedness to act outside the box. In The Shaping of Things to Come, Mike Frost and I suggested that you try some of the following challenges:7</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask a jester. That's what kings did to break out of the dead-end environment of their yes-men. The jester's job was to parody any proposal, make it appear in a fresh light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn from mistakes. Before Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, he discovered 1,800 ways not to make it. Columbus was looking for India. Errors are natural — one of life's primary vehicles of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try a different approach. Most of our advances have occurred because someone challenged the rules and tried a different approach. What rules should you challenge here and now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break out. The more you do something the same way, the more difficult it is to think about doing it in another way. Eat ice cream for breakfast. See a film you wouldn't normally see. Take a different route to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get out of your box. Anyone can look for fashion in a boutique. Anyone can look for history in a museum. Explore. Look for fashion in a hardware store or an airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig deeper. Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it's the only one you have. The best way to get a great idea is to have lots of ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a genius. You can benefit by learning from the lives, ideas, and actions of the great geniuses of history. You can probably tell by now that my heroes include Einstein, Kierkegaard, and Buber. But you could easily pick Van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Edison, or Hannibal (not Lecter!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brainstorm. If properly carried out, brainstorming can help you not only come up with sackfuls of new ideas but also decide which is best.8</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some great — and seemingly small — ways I have found to spur creativity and innovation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take notes. Always carry a small notebook and a pen or pencil with you. That way, if you're struck by an idea, you can quickly note it. (You can use an audio-recording device as well, but I find the visual aspect of writing helpful.) Upon rereading your notes, you may discover that about 90 percent of your ideas are nutty. Don't worry, that's normal. What is important is the 10 percent that are brilliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use charts and diagrams. I'm a right-brained person, so this helps me immensely. All who know me know I find it helpful to put my ideas into graphic form. In fact, I would say that almost all my best thinking is done with diagrams first and articulated afterward.9</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use words. If you're stuck for an idea, open a dictionary, randomly select a word, and then try to formulate ideas incorporating this word. You'd be surprised how well this works. The concept is based on a simple but little-known truth: freedom sometimes inhibits creativity. There's nothing like restriction to get you thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define your problem. Grab a sheet of paper, electronic notebook, computer, or whatever you use to make notes, and define your problem in detail. You'll probably find ideas positively spewing out once you've done this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can and must be innovative. This means fostering the environment where creativity and innovation is encouraged, acknowledged, and rewarded. To do this, we need to promote a culture of creative and holy dissatisfaction. Onward and upward!</p>

</ol>
<p>They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.</p>
<p>And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</p>
