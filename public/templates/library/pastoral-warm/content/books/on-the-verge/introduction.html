<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>It is with a deep sense of privilege, mixed with an urgent and deep-rooted sense of obligation to God and his church, that we offer On the Verge to you. We would even be bold enough to claim we feel called to write this book. But we do so in fear and trembling, because we also recognize it is largely a visionary book that points to a possible future that is only beginning to be worked out as we speak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but for reasons that we hope will become clearer, there aren’t many mature expressions of apostolic movements in the West, and yet it is largely to the Western church that we wish to speak.</p>
<p>The task of this book is nothing less than to call the church to recover her most ancient, her most potent, and also her most beautiful form, that of the apostolic movement.</p>
<p>Both of us sense something immense happening in our day. Like a phoenix arising from the dying embers of Christendom, something essentially new and yet as ancient as the faith itself is emerging. It is the birth of apostolic movements again in the West. This, we believe, is a sign of great hope, and this book is written to help birth the paradigm shift, to compellingly describe it, and then to help churches practically implement it. We do this on the assumption that if the church fails to make the shift to apostolic movements again, Christian influence in Western culture will continue to fade, and church attendance will remain in its current trajectory of decline. All we can say in writing this book is, not on our shift! Not if we can help it.</p>
<p>We’re honored to have this book set the agenda for Exponential 2011: On the Verge, the conference put on by the Exponential Network, arguably the largest gathering of church planters in the world.</p>
<p>We believe that church planters and grassroots missionaries have always represented the productive future of the church, and we’re honored to serve them in whatever way we can. Hence, a lot of our work 18 Introduction goes toward their cause. However, this work has a much broader focus.</p>
<p>It is to all expressions of church, but especially those that have been operating in the contemporary church-growth paradigm, undoubtedly the most successful and dominant ecclesial paradigm from the last forty years. Practitioners of all contemporary forms of church (missional church and church planting included) will find that On the Verge is very much written with them in mind.</p>
<h2>Why We Wrote This Book</h2>
<p>The clue to how and why this book was written lies in the people who wrote it and in how God has shaped us and our callings.</p>
<p>I (Alan) come to this book as an Australian who believes he is called to North America on the assumption that the future of the church in the West is somehow bound up with what happens in and through the church in this context. As distasteful as this might appear to non-American readers, we are all forced to recognize that the church in every Western context is in serious decline. If the answer was going to come from Europe (or Australia and New Zealand, for that matter), it would have done so by now, and yet biblical Christianity in these contexts continues to be increasingly marginalized, and in some places is nearing complete extinction. Paradoxically, we seem to be inhabiting a pivotal age — a time in which decisions and directions take on a strategic significance. What happens in the U.S. context, in this time, will in many ways determine the shape and the viability of Christianity in both the West and beyond.</p>
<p>My own sense of calling is to somehow call the church to recover her original — and originative — apostolic ways and to become a highimpact Jesus movement again in the West. I don't have a grandiose sense of my role in this, simply that I must play it out to the best of my ability and get out of the way. In order to do this, I have come to believe, we simply have to activate what is clearly one of the most significant church movements in the last fifty years — the megachurch in its various forms — and allow them to help negotiate a way into a new future. It won't be the only form of apostolic movement that will emerge, but it will be a very significant one. And I have little doubt many of the people and churches I'm working with in this (particularly the Future Travelers cohort and Exponential Network) are going to map a way forward for others to follow. I come to this task as a person deeply committed to grassroots, incarnational mission, and I must serve what is now called this Verge movement in whatever way I can, offering whatever insights and resources I might have gained along the way. On the Verge is an integrative attempt at such an offering.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with my work thus far will find that while there is new material added here, On the Verge is really a serious attempt to process and apply the Apostolic Genius paradigm, developed in The Forgotten Ways, to existing (largely evangelical and evangelistic) churches, as well as to other existing church systems. So while the core ideas are consistent with what I have laid out in my previous work, there is a radical reframing of these to be able to inform and engage a healthy megachurch movement. There is a lot of change management and systems processing going on here, and this is what I bring to the table.</p>
<p>I (Dave), on the other hand, am a church planter turned megachurch pastor with a passionate conviction that the strategy Jesus describes for accomplishing his mission is a movement of reproducing churches of all kinds. The church I lead, Community Christian Church (www. communitychristian. org), is a reproducing missional community that has always dreamed, worked, and prayed to be a catalyst for a movement of reproducing churches. To that end, Community has championed reproduction at all levels (Christ followers, leaders, artists, groups, teams, sites, churches, and networks), with a dream of two hundred locations in Chicagoland. Community has also given birth to New Thing (www. newthing. org), an International movement of reproducing churches that is doubling its number of churches and networks every year. My brother Jon Ferguson and I tell the story of movement making and give practical how-tos in Exponential: How You and Your Friends Can Start a Missional Church Movement. It is also my pleasure to serve as the president of the Exponential Conference and chairman of the board of the Exponential Network. Why tell you all this? I list this as a resume not to impress but to show you how, on a day-to-day basis, I’m trading my life to catalyze a movement of reproducing churches.</p>
<p>Despite our passion for movement and the perceived success of both Community and New Thing, there was within me and my team 20 Introduction at one point a growing discontent. While we continued to reproduce sites and churches locally, nationally, and globally, it was friends like Neil Cole and exposure to Alan’s teaching in The Forgotten Ways that helped us see there was something missing in our understanding of movement. We understood and were putting into practice the apostolic mission of reproductive church planting, but we were not mobilizing all of God’s people into every sphere of life. We had too many people supporting our missional movement with prayer and finances, but not with their 24/7, everyday lives. We had become skilled at reproducing macro (sites and churches), and now we needed to become equally proficient in reproducing micro (mobilizing every person for mission in their context).</p>
<p>It was in conversations with other pastors of large multisite churches in Future Travelers that I discovered we were not alone. As I talked with these leaders, whose churches make up the list of the most innovative, fastest-growing, and largest churches in America, I found they were on a very similar journey. And if God had us all on this journey, our hunch was that he had many of you on this journey too.</p>
<h2>How We Wrote This Book</h2>
<p>Alan comes to the task as a missional strategist and apostolic theologian, offering systemic and architectural perspectives. Dave approaches the task as an apostolic practitioner, always asking these questions: How do we do this in real life? How can a church really make this happen?</p>
<p>As in all attempts at harmony, singular voices in their own right work to create something greater than the sum of their parts. We’ve penned this book similarly: instead of writing in one voice, we’ve kept our own voices, writing from our own perspectives, such as they are.</p>
<p>Alan's style is more technical and deals more with ideas as they relate to practice, while Dave brings the leader's driving need to align the systems and get them moving. Alan is therefore more systemic, objective, and design-focused, while Dave is more motivational, pragmatic, and implementation-focused. And although we have come to our conclusions via very different histories, approaches, and perspectives, we speak with the same awareness and from within the same paradigm. With this in mind, we've written the main section of the book as a dialogue — each chapter as a proposal of sorts with an accompanying response. When one of us writes a chapter, the other responds, and so on.</p>
<p>We have divided the material according to our relative strengths and interests, and we’ve each written chapters and sections, with the other responding. Thebook is broken into four main sections after the first chapter: Part 1: “Imagine” (written by Alan, with Dave responding) Part 2: “Shift” (written by Alan, with Dave responding) Part 3: “Innovate” (written by Dave, with Alan responding) Part 4: “Move” (written by Dave, with Alan responding) Given our approach and our relative strengths, Alan’s sections are packed with ideas and concepts derived from missional thinking and approaches. Dave’s are intensely practical, derived as they are from his leadership of a budding movement based in Chicago. For those who are pragmatically inclined, we encourage you to slow down and really take in what is being laid out in the more theoretical foundations. For theorists, we suggest that you really attend to how it is being worked out in practice. It is vital that we retain the integrity of a true biblical knowledge that is based on the outworking of ideas in practice.</p>
<p>Also popping up throughout the text will be ideas, slogans, and the stories of the various churches trying to implement what we call Verge church thinking. We hope this approach works for you.</p>
<p>One final thing should be said before we launch into thebook proper. With all that will be said about theology, sociology, organizational theory, leadership studies, and so on, we don’t want to give the impression that reigniting apostolic movements can be simply a work of human endeavor. It must be, and is, a work of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Certainly, we must do our part, but in the end the church exists by the grace, presence, and power of God himself, and to him we must constantly turn if we are going to be the kind of people he wants us to be. Forgive us if we ever give you the impression to the contrary.</p>
<p>We prayerfully submit this work to you, and to the Holy Spirit, that he might enliven it in your hearts and in the life of your community.</p>
<p>We are poised at a precipice. Women and men with hungry hearts, wide-open imaginations, and hands ready to work will find much to work with in these pages. In cooperation with the sending Father, sent Son, and commissioning Holy Spirit, we join our prayer to yours: that every member contains within them a church, and every church contains within her a movement. We are standing at a pivot point of history. We are on the verge.</p>
