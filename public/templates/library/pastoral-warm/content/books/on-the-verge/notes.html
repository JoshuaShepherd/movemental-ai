<p>gave on the text: “There’s a lot about ‘remembering’ in the Bible. In the Old Testament, God would call His people to build altars out of stones so they would remember. He instructed them to tie the law on a string and bind it around the fingers, put it on their doorposts. Remember, remember, remember... And in the Bible, remembering is more than just recalling information. In the Bible, when you remember something, if you do it right, what was real once before becomes present, becomes real once again. When you consider the constant injunction in the Bible, especially in Deuteronomy, to remember, this injunction from Isaiah stands out like a diamond against black velvet.” The injunction: “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland” (Isa. 43:18 – 19).</p>

<li>For instance, Ed Stetzer and David Putnam suggest this: “One of the most</li>

<p>important considerations in breaking the [missional] code is to break from our own preferences. Simply put, being missional doesn’t mean doing things the way we like them. It means to take the gospel into the context where we have been called....</p>

<li>In the complex systems of the existing church, lasting and deep change must</li>
</ol>
<p>come from the mouth of the river, the paradigm level. Even so, this is not to say that the process is a one-way street. Again, we must think systems, with their two-way flows. The best way to look at this process is as so: paradigm 1 ethos 1 practice. Each element or layer is always dynamically interacting with the others. Renewal takes place along these lines.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It must be stated here that in making this massive claim, I do not believe</li>
</ol>
<p>that this is the product of my supposedly smart intellect. I feel that I have been a custodian of something given to me to pass on. I really feel this has been a revelation to me. I do not claim any authority in that; I simply state it as I have experienced it.</p>
<p>Also, The Forgotten Ways thesis has been out there for five years now, and no one has been able to fault its claims as yet. And while it needs more study, it seems to apply.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This is a big claim, but we stand by it. To be sure, in The Forgotten Ways Alan</li>
</ol>
<p>is suggesting that while distinct movements in history might have more than six elements present, they never have less than the six described here. As such, the six elements of mDNA represent the irreducible phenomenology of all apostolic movements in every time and place. Once again we suggest that leadership wishing to apply the Verge church process should seriously engage the ideas laid out in The Forgotten Ways and The Forgotten Ways Handbook. Furthermore, all of Alan’s books are in some ways elaborations and developments of the key ideas of The Forgotten Ways. Dave’s book Exponential is a further elaboration of the ideas of movements.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>In The Forgotten Ways, Alan elaborates on this idea of latent potentials and</li>
</ol>
<p>partly draws it out from the logical implications of the fact that a young believer, scattered by persecution, can start a church and a church can start a movement. In other words, it must have all been present in potential in the smallest part, in this case the fleeing believer. As a seed contains the full potential of a forest, and the spark contains the full potential of a forest fire, so even the smallest unit of ecclesia carries the potential for the whole movement.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>This is the chief metaphor of Ori Brafman and Rod A. Beckstrom’s book The</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>Rob Wegner recently told me of Satheya Salin, a man he met on a trip to</li>
</ol>
<p>India not long ago. This man was first to bring the gospel to an unreached people group called the Paliyar. They live at the top of the mountain in the jungle, harvesting honey and fungus from trees to survive. Satheya, the church planter who brought the good news to them, is a day laborer who carries wood for a living. He has a fifth-grade education. From the viewpoint of the world, he is among the most insignificant people on the planet. He is poor, uneducated, and noninfluential. Yet, in light of eternity, he is among the most significant people on the planet. In terms of what really matters, what is more important than ushering a new people group into the kingdom? The Paliyar are spread out in villages all over that mountain range. Satheya is giving the rest of his life to plant churches in each village. So he works sixty hours a week hauling wood, but the rest of the time he is the pastor of the Paliyar people. I could talk for an hour straight about him. If Satheya Salin can do it, anyone can do it.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Does this mean that all the churches that result from spontaneous expansion</li>
</ol>
<p>are mature? Of course not! But are most of the churches in the dominant expression of church in the West mature? We don’t think so! So maturity is another matter, and immaturity is not limited to people-movements.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>In many ways, it is a radicalizing process, because it takes us to the roots</li>
</ol>
<p>(Latin, radix) of apostolic movements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read The Starfish and the Spider, for instance. Also Dee Hock, One from</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>This emphasis on Christology (the phenomenon of Jesus) doesn’t obscure</li>
</ol>
<p>the reality of the Trinity but rather gives it a distinct shape. We are introduced into the Trinitarian life of God exactly as we have received it — through the lens of the life and ministry of Jesus. It means that our focus as Christ-ians, our very identity, is directly related to our understanding and experience of Christ. It is the second person of the Trinity who is the Mediator between God and man; no one can come to the Father except by means of him. And the Spirit is given to the church to lead us into a true understanding of God in Christ.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This concept is more thoroughly discussed in Alan Hirsch and Michael Frost,</li>

<li>Also behind this theology lies a “formula”: Christology determines missiology,</li>
</ol>
<p>which in turn determines ecclesiology. Another way of saying this is that God in Christ sets the agenda (mission) for the church, and the mission in turn determines and shapes the cultural forms of ecclesia. This will be very important in the Verge process because it helps us understand how mission prompts innovation in cultural expressions of church. Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways, 142 – 44.</p>

<li>Apostolic environment is such an important issue, I’ve developed a new book</li>

<li>Some underground movements in China have around three million adherents, and they do it without centralized headquarters, vast payrolls, buildings, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>History proves time and again that these kinds of movements are somewhat unstoppable because they are highly committed, can reproduce rapidly, are hard to eradicate, and tend to bypass the need for centralized structures. In short, they simply spread from person to person.</p>

<p>Vineyard Central is the epitome of a church that is morphing with its mission. It was a conventional congregation in Cincinnati until the church building was condemned by the city. Instead of getting another building, the pastor made an unconventional move and had the congregants stand in the sanctuary based on zip codes during their final Sunday gathering. He then said, “Look around you. This is now your church.” And a network of house churches was born. Since then, they weaned themselves off virtually all administrative costs, live in several monastic-style community houses, and own an old Catholic church building that they use as an art space, periodic homeless shelter, and place for monthly larger gatherings.

<p>Is what we are saying here undermining the Verge process we have articulated in these last few chapters? No. Because however we might think of them, our practices don’t rise in a vacuum; they are outward and visible expressions of what we think are important. They are formulated out of what we believe and are given their true meaning and significance from the way we perceive the world and our place within it. In other words, our practices are both expressions of our paradigms and embodiments of our ethos. Rather than thinking of this as being in conflict with the Verge process, think of it as simply reinforcing and supporting it.</p>

<p>This is a place where sacramental churches can transform their age-old catechumenate process into real missional dynamite by making it the first stage of a lifetime apprenticeship to Jesus. The traditional Easter baptism can then become ordination and commissioning!</p>

Here are some of the key resources available for developing mis-
sional forms of church. They are arranged as key training sys-
by category.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Training Systems</h2>
<p>3D Ministries is an interdenominational and innovative church-movement that has planted hundreds of churches as they learn how to engage the European and American post-Chris tian culture (www.3dministries. com).</p>
<p>Forge Mission Training Network International, or Forge, (U.S., Canada, Australia) is a training center that exists to birth and nurture the missional church. They provide training, internships, resources, and consulting for church leaders (www. forge. org. au, www. forgecanada. ca, www. forgeamerica. org).</p>
<p>Future Travelers is a two-year learning cohort initially composed of twelve megachurches (representing more than eighty thousand people) committed to seriously factoring missional movements into their current equation of church.</p>
<p>Missio exists to inspire and apprentice the church’s missional spirit — one leader, one church, and one organization at a time. Codirectors Hugh Halter and Matt Smay and their team provide training and resources to church leaders (www. missio. us).</p>
<p>New Thing (www. newthing. org) is an International movement of reproducing churches and networks relentlessly committed to the mission of helping people find their way back to God.</p>
<p>Shapevine is a ministry of Leadership Journal and Christianity Today that focuses on providing people with missional resources, training, and networking opportunities (www. shapevine. com).</p>
<p>Together in Mission (TIM) is a British training system led by pioneering missiologist Martin Robinson (http://togetherinmission. co. uk/). It offers degrees from the University of Wales and does the training in local church contexts.</p>
<p>GCM Collective, led by Jeff Vanderstelt and Caesar Kalinowski. Learning from the experience of Soma, one of the Future Traveler churches (www. gcmcollective. com).</p>
<h2>Tools for Change</h2>
<p>APEST. This is a highly regarded tool to help people access and operate in their fivefold ministry vocation. This can be done individually and (even better) in teams, using 360-degree feedback that the test provides (www. theforgottenways. org/apest or www. apest. org). mPULSE. This is a test designed to help churches and organizations diagnose and strategize using the concept of Apostolic Genius as the central core. It is designed with Verge churches in mind. It can be taken as small as cell group level as well as systemwide (www. theforgottenways. org/mpulse).</p>

<p>About the Expo ne ntia l Seri e s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interest in church planting has grown significantly in recent years. The need for new churches has never been greater. At the same time, the number of models and approaches are expanding. To address the unique opportunities of churches in this landscape, Exponential, in partnership with Leadership Network and Zondervan, launched the Exponential Series in 2010.</p>
<p>Books in this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the reproducing church story.</li>
<li>Celebrate the diversity of models and approaches God is using</li>
</ul>
<p>reproduce healthy congregations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the pioneering practices of healthy reproducing</li>
</ul>
<p>churches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equip, inspire, and challenge kingdom-minded leaders with the</li>
</ul>
<p>tools they need in their journey of becoming reproducing church leaders.</p>
<p>Exponential exists to attract, inspire, and equip kingdom-minded leaders to engage in a movement of high-impact, reproducing churches. We provide a national voice for this movement through the Exponential Conference, the Exponential Initiative, Exponential Venture, and the Exponential Series.</p>
<p>Leadership Network, a division of One HundredX, exists to accelerate the impact of 100X leaders. Believing that meaningful conversations and strategic connections can change the world, we seek to help leaders navigate the future by exploring new ideas and finding application for each unique context.</p>
<p>For more information about the Exponential Series, go to www. exponential.org/books.</p>
<h2>About Lead e rs hip Net work</h2>
<p>Since 1984, Leadership Network has fostered church innovation and growth by diligently pursuing its far-reaching mission statement: To identify high-capacity Christian leaders, to connect them with other leaders, and to help them multiply their impact.</p>
<p>While specific techniques may vary as the church faces new opportunities and challenges, Leadership Network consistently focuses on bringing together entrepreneurial leaders who are pursuing similar ministry initiatives. The resulting peer-to-peer interaction, dialogue, and collaboration—often across denominational lines—helps these leaders better refine their individual strategies and accelerate their own innovations.</p>
<p>To further enhance this process, Leadership Network develops and distributes highly targeted ministry tools and resources, including books, DVDs and videotapes, special reports, e-publications, and free downloads.</p>
