<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<h2>Gaining Missional Mome ntu m</h2>
<p>In building a great institution, there is no single defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. Rather our research showed that it feels like turning a giant, heavy flywheel. Pushing with great effort — days, weeks and months of work, with almost imperceptible progress — you finally get the flywheel to inch forward.... You keep pushing, and with persistent effort, you eventually get the flywheel to complete one entire turn.... You keep pushing, in an intelligent and consistent direction, and the flywheel moves a bit faster. It builds more momentum... then, at some point — breakthrough! Each turn builds upon previous work, compounding your investment of effort. The flywheel flies forward with almost unstoppable momentum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how you build greatness.</p>
<p>—JIM COLLINS, BUSINESS STRATEGIST</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apollo 13 mission may have been famous for its difficulties — immortalized forever in the words “Houston, we have a problem” — but it is just as renowned for its innovative solution.</p>
<p>Midway to the moon, an oxygen tank internally combusted on Apollo 13, ruining the mission and jeopardizing the crew. The spacecraft circled the moon to turn itself around, and the crew had to shut down the command module and use the lunar module Aquarius as a lifeboat. Carbon dioxide levels were rising, but the air filtering canisters from the command module were square and wouldn’t fit the Aquarius’s round openings. While Apollo 13 threatened to be lost forever, the NASA team back in Houston scrambled to put together a solution to save the ship, using only parts from that spacecraft. NASA’s mission control engineers used duct tape to alter a square canister so it would fit a round hole. They called this contraption a “mailbox” and instructed the astronauts on how to alter theirs. The innovative problem solving of NASA’s astronauts and engineers saved Apollo 13’s mission from complete disaster and their crew from death.</p>
<p>The church in the United States is also facing a life-threatening problem. Without innovative problem solving using all God has given us, the church will flame out in its generation. As by now you’re no doubt aware, we believe that the solution lies in reactivating the church as an apostolic movement. And to do this, we have suggested a distinct, somewhat unique process. It’s important to see this process as a self-reinforcing system, like the flywheel described by Collins in the quote on p. 249: turn it over and over and over again, and finally you can develop the kind of unstoppable momentum that will lead to apostolic movement.</p>
<p>In chapter 1, we addressed the twofold issue facing the church: a strategic problem and a missionary problem. To review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic problem. The majority of churches in the U.S. are using</li>
</ul>
<p>a model of church designed to reach 40 percent (and declining) of the American population. This leaves around 60 percent (and climbing) of the American population outside the reach of the local church.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missionary problem. The church of Jesus in America has forgotten its call to be a “sent” people. Without a sending competency and capacity, the mission will never be accomplished. If we are going to reach that 60 percent segment of the population, it means that every Christ follower is a “sent” person with a missionary call on his or her life.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Solution: Apostolic Movement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we know the problem, what’s the solution? Apostolic movement. Figure 26 succinctly illustrates the solution needed by the church in the West, and also our understanding of apostolic movement. It’s going to take a missional church plus missional people to make a missional movement. multiplication people on mission apostolic church planting in every sphere movement</p>
<h2>Figure 26</h2>
<p>Amissional church will always express itself as a reproducing church that multiplies new sites and churches. Amissional people involves Christ followers sent as agents of good news in every sphere and domain of life (work, play, politics, economics, education, and so on). When you add those two together, you have the missional equation of an apostolic movement. Let’s take a look at why those two parts of the equation are so important in creating movement.</p>
<h2>Multiplying Churches</h2>
<p>Dave Olson, director of the American Church Research Project and author of American Church in Crisis, conducted groundbreaking research from over two hundred thousand churches in the United States. His research compared the impact of new churches with that of existing churches. Figure 27 shows the percentage of yearly growth based on the decade in which a church was started. His data goes back over two hundred years.</p>
<p>10% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% – 2% pre-1800s 1800s 1810s 1820s 1830s 1840s 1850s 1860s 1870s 1880s 1890s 1900s 1910s 1920s 2000s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s Figure 27</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s make a few observations showing the clear need for church multiplication:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, eighteen out of twenty-two decades show negative growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two out of those twenty-two decades indicate less than 1 percent growth or a plateau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only two decades indicate a positive growth rate, and the first</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>positive indicator is among churches started in the last ten to twenty years (at a little more than 2 percent growth rate).</p>
<ul>
<li>However, new churches started in the last ten years grew on the</li>
</ul>
<p>average by 9 percent.</p>
<p>It’s only as we began to take church planting seriously that we begin to see a change in growth patterns! Here’s why: according to Olson and others, new churches have three to four times as many conversions as do established churches. That means that if an established church of five hundred people helped ten people become Christ followers, a new church of five hundred would likely help thirty to forty people in that same time frame. And in the first ten years, new churches grow twenty-three times faster than churches over ten years old. Is there any doubt that new churches and church multiplication are a crucial part of the equation leading to apostolic movement? I think not!1 People on Mission in Every Sphere In this case, rather than persuade you with stats, let me tell you about Kathy, who convinced me of the need to see all of God’s people mobilized for mission into every domain of life.</p>
<p>I was surprised when Kathy told me, “Dave, I’m not sure I can get them to come to church with me.” The reason why I was surprised was because nearly every week, she brought people who are far from God to Community. I told the The real revolution first part of this story in Exponential, but now in China was not the there is even more to this story. The reason why Communist revolution; her statement surprised me was because I would it was the fact that the often look out into the crowd at a weekend service and see an entire row of people sitting next to people of God recovKathy, and I knew those were people early on in ered Apostolic Genius. their spiritual search. Kathy is as passionate about helping people find their way back to God as I am. So when Kathy described these young ladies in an eating disorder group she was leading and said, “I’m not sure I can get them to come to church with me,” I had to listen.</p>
<p>She went on to tell me the girls were overwhelmed and terrified to come into a room with several hundred people. It was too intimidating. She said some of the girls would get into the building but would stay out in the café and lobby area the whole time. Then Kathy asked me, “Could we start something for people who won’t come to church?” That was one of the conversations that forced me to grapple with the change that needed to be made at Community if we wanted to see an apostolic movement. We were seeing church multiplication happening through starting new sites at Community and new churches through New Thing, but we were not seeing all the people of God on mission. We had thousands of people who were sitting on the sidelines and needed to be mobilized for mission, just like Kathy was requesting. Without this change, a true apostolic movement wouldn’t occur.</p>
<p>Kathy’s question challenged me: “Could we start something for people who won’t come to church?” And the answer — remember that yes reflex — absolutely had to be yes.</p>
<p>Kathy was working at a local hospital and had a genuine love for young women with eating disorders. One of the girls in Kathy’s eating disorder group was Kristin, a very bright young adult and avid reader who was spiritually curious but not yet a believer. Kathy and Kristin became friends and talked about everything. One day Kristin was particularly scared as her struggle grew dangerously close to death, and she asked Kathy to pray for her. This was the beginning of her journey back to God.</p>
<p>It was a long and hard journey for Kristin, as she would spiral down into depression and even attempt suicide — overdosing on drugs and finding herself hospitalized again. As Kathy visited Kristin after one overdose, she’d just received the news that her liver was shutting down and ceasing to function. Kathy prayed for Kristin’s liver to start working again, and that prayer was answered almost immediately.</p>
<p>It was huge for Kristin, and her faith soared. Eventually Kristin was released to Arabella House, a house for girls with eating disorders to continue in their recovery process. It was at Arabella that Kristin met Allyson as they were both going through their recovery, and they started attending Community.</p>
<p>Soon both girls were released from Arabella and continued their friendship and joined a small group together. One weekend in February, we had a celebration ser vice in which we challenged everyone to take their faith public in baptism. Kristin was at Community on Saturday night and went forward to be baptized by Kathy. Then on Sunday, Kristin was working her new part-time job as a barista at Community’s café when her friend Allyson came up to her saying she wanted to get baptized. Allyson pulled Kristin out from behind the counter to go with her and baptize her. I saved Kristin’s Facebook message to me: “This baptism weekend was absolutely incredible! I made my public declaration of acceptance of Jesus as my Savior on Saturday night and then had the honor of baptizing one of my best friends this morning — she grabbed me right from the café!” Kathy is simply one example of someone living out the missional strategy that Jesus gave to his disciples in John 20:21: “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” Now multiply Kathy thousands and millions of times over. As Christ followers engage in mission and begin to move into every sphere of life, momentum builds, and in time an apostolic movement will burst into full force. To miss this part of the movemental equation is to make a big blunder. In my opinion, this is the mistake most church leaders make. They forget the sheer missional power of the people of God.</p>
<p>Looking for the equation for missional momentum? Do the math.</p>
<p>When you add church-planting multiplication with people on mission in every sphere of life, it equates to apostolic movement: movementum.</p>
<h2>On the Verge of Movementum</h2>
<p>Movementum, when we are operating from the right paradigm of church, should be entirely natural; it’s what happens in all exponential movements everywhere. It is, we suggest, the church’s deepest design. It is what happens when ecclesia is being what ecclesia is meant to be: an expansive, high-impact, transformative people-movement.</p>
<p>Remember, we all have within us the full coding and potential of Apostolic Genius, and so with the Spirit’s guidance, at any time we can become the people we were designed to be. Recall the metaphor of the spark and the seed used earlier by Alan: in the same way that a seed has the full potential of a forest, so too the spark contains the full potential of a forest fire. What is needed is (re)activation of Apostolic Genius, not an imposition of some trendy new organizational concept from the business world. This is liberating, because it means becoming what we were originally designed to be — it should feel right.</p>
<p>We know the problem. And although we find it hard to get there, we really do know the solution. So now let’s turn our attention to the very practical question of how. How do I conceive of, communicate, and apply the process outlined in this book?</p>
<p>Previously Alan indicated the shift processes of embedding Apostolic Genius, developing ethos, and shaping practices needed to activate and maintain a consistent apostolic movement. How do imagining, shifting, and innovating contribute to movement and momentum?</p>
<p>The simple diagram in figure 28 shows us that movementum occurs via a continuous cycling of the church through the threedimensional process: imagine, shift, and innovate.</p>
<h2>DO IT SEE IT</h2>
<p>innovation imagination MOVEMENTUM</p>
<h2>GET IT shift</h2>
<h2>Figure 28</h2>
<p>These phases aren’t three steps you take and then you have arrived, nor are they three boxes you check off as accomplished. This is a journey of movement with the Spirit of the living God. Your church will have to imagine and reimagine itself as a movement for every time and every context you find yourselves in. In relationship with others and by the leading of the Spirit, your church will make the shift to integrate the right practices that create a culture of mission in your community. Once those practices are identified, they will become part of the routine and rhythms of life that allow you to gain missional momentum.</p>
<p>As the wheel turns over, time and time again, you’ll find that the momentum continues to gain traction. And remember, in the way that momentum works, with every rotation of the flywheel, the church gains greater and greater momentum, until it finds itself accelerating at a pace that can only be called an apostolic movement.</p>
<h2>A Categorization of Movement</h2>
<p>Before we rush into the future and take you through the exciting process of gaining missional momentum, it would be wise for us to pause and do some serious reflection on where your church is right now. In many ways, where you are determines what you see, and also will determine the approach you might take to ignite movement in your midst. In other words, approach and strategy are likely to change depending on where your church is in the continuum. The following are five major categories of churches:</p>
<ol>
<li>sacramental/high church</li>
<li>traditional/mainline Protestant or conservative evangelical</li>
<li>contemporary/church-growth model</li>
<li>micro-missional/incarnational</li>
<li>apostolic movement</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding that all churches are hybrids of various forms, we can say there is some overlap between the different categories. However, all churches that are interested in the Verge approach will fit somewhere on this Verge process continuum. Because of the latent Apostolic Genius, we believe that each category of church can generate movement, but that it would be harder depending on the existing church system. The highly institutional forms (on the left side of the diagram) are likely to find it harder, because of entrenched thinking and paradigm.</p>
<p>So perhaps we can represent this as in figure 29.</p>
<h2>Verge church process</h2>
<p>sacramental traditional contemporary microapostolic missional movement institutional movemental</p>
<h2>Figure 29</h2>
<p>It’s a very useful exercise to see our churches somewhere on this continuum between institutional and movemental forms; this is because identifying our current organizational style situation will affect the way we determine strategy and advancement in the Verge process. With the appropriate disclaimers in mind about the particulars (and recognizing that there are usually a few exceptions to all generalizations), let’s consider each type of church and the unique challenges and opportunities of moving each through the change process toward apostolic movement. Why? Because it’s important to acknowledge that some church forms are going to struggle harder and longer to get through the Verge church process, depending upon where they are at right now. Know where you are, and you will have an easier time getting where you need to be.</p>
<h2>Sacramental Churches</h2>
<p>Historically, Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches draw upon ancient liturgy, prayers, and music in worship and gathering.</p>
<p>Sacramental churches at their best are excellent at evoking a sense of awe and the grandeur of God, as well as the high calling of the church throughout different ages and cultures. It’s always a challenge, however, for sacramental churches not to miss the “forest” of God’s movemental mission for the “trees” of centuries of accumulated tradition.2 Historically, sacramental churches have been the most resistant to the more movemental forms, because of the deep entrenchment of the institutional paradigm. The most significant challenge will come here, in the ecclesiological self-understanding. Missiologically, they’ll need a lot of convincing, because they are built squarely on the Christendom assumptions of church and society.</p>
<h2>Traditional Churches</h2>
<p>Traditional churches include most historic mainline Protestant churches, Baptist churches, some of the mainstream Pentecostal churches, and Brethren congregations. Traditional churches can offer a real sense of warmth, hospitality, and — for those who are successfully acculturated into their congregations — belonging. Historically, these churches have tended to be the most supportive of world missions. Perhaps more than any other model, however, traditional churches face the challenge of not becoming victims of their own past success by continuing to pursue the dwindling 40 percent of the population at the expense of the growing 60 percent. Furthermore, the mainline Protestant churches, which form part of this grouping, have become bastions of liberal theology, which by its nature cannot fund (theologically or morally) apostolic movements.</p>
<p>The issues faced by traditional churches therefore will be largely missiological, as they are geared mainly for a Christendom approach to mission, both structurally and ideologically.</p>
<h2>Contemporary Churches</h2>
<p>Some of the first churches to become aware of shifting population trends were the church-growth movement, a trans-denominational phenomenon beginning at Fuller Seminary in the sixties with voices like Donald Mc Gavran and C. Peter Wagner. Church-growth congregations tend to possess an amazing capacity for incubating vision and carrying out this vision. This skill set is invaluable for movemental growth. The Achilles’ heel for church-growth churches is becoming calcified in one way of being missional. The adage is true: those married to the spirit of this age are vulnerable to becoming widows in the next. Baby boomer generations that were faithful in pioneering authentic expressions of church for their culture need to become champions of today’s apostolic movement.</p>
<h2>Micro-Missional Churches</h2>
<p>Seeded in the Jesus movement of the 1970s, house churches began proliferating in the eighties and really came into their own in the nineties with the advent of the internet. People burned out and left more institutional forms of church and began to find the intimacy and community they craved in smaller, home-based gatherings. In the past decade, micro-missional communities (these days called simple or organic churches) have come into the Christian mainstream, many laying aside past animosities born of reaction toward authoritarian or abusive institutional models. The great virtue of micro-missional churches is their small, portable, multipliable size.</p>
<p>Their peculiar vulnerabilities include the ever-constant danger of becoming insular. In addition, more organic forms are suspicious and resistant to any form of organization and therefore find it hard to act collectively.</p>
<h2>Apostolic Movement</h2>
<p>The fulfillment of our missional God’s dream for redeeming his world and his beloved people is an apostolic movement. Having rediscovered its Apostolic Genius, it leaves behind the institutional form of church and becomes a viral, highly transformative, gospel movement.</p>
<p>It’s a reproducing church whose sole focus is the mission of Jesus filled with people who are engaged in mission in every sphere of life.</p>
<p>At this point, it would be helpful to discuss the Future Travelers church cohort and how they fall into this continuum, as many started out in a very different place.</p>
<h2>Future Travelers Churches</h2>
<p>In our work with the Future Travelers churches, we notice a pattern which is depicted by figure 30. missional M Omissional communities V Mmega (contemporary) E Nattractional T</p>
<h2>Figure 30</h2>
<p>The majority of the churches in Future Travelers were started with the vision of being a contemporary church that would attract the unchurched. In a relatively short period of time, these churches grew into megachurches, reaching thousands of those who were far from God.</p>
<p>Having developed the proficiency for reproducing large, the next step was to go to multiple sites and/or church planting. They began efforts toward reproducing small through missional communities.</p>
<p>From that platform and experience, they are using all their resources for missional movement. It’s the conviction of this group now that over the next decade, all of these expressions, both large and small, will reproduce and exist simultaneously inside the movement. That’s what we are seeing in other parts of the world that are experiencing apostolic movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every Church Has Movement Potential</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type of church has its own unique challenges in shifting toward an apostolic movement, but because of the mDNA that resides within each of us and each of our communities, every form has movemental potential. The intention of the above diagram isn’t to discourage but instead to take a candid look at the challenges of each expression of the body of Christ. If you are willing to take an honest look at your community, any expression has possibility of movement. Furthermore, in coming years, we expect that all forms will be included inside the movement.</p>
<p>Gaining Missional Momentum through the Verge Process The Verge process is a change strategy for any church to use to move from a more institutional paradigm to a more movemental way of believing and behaving. And before there can be movement, there must be momentum, and that takes time.</p>
<p>Jim Collins describes it this way: Picture an egg. Day after day, it sits there. No one pays attention to it. No one notices it. Certainly no one takes a picture of it or puts it on the cover of a celebrity-focused business magazine.</p>
<p>Then one day, the shell cracks and out jumps a chicken. All of a sudden, the major magazines and newspapers jump on the story: “Stunning Turnaround at Egg!” and “The Chick Who Led the Breakthrough at Egg!” From the outside, the story always reads like an overnight sensation — as if the egg had suddenly and radically altered itself into a chicken.</p>
<p>Now picture the egg from the chicken’s point of view. While the outside world was ignoring this seemingly dormant egg, the chicken within was evolving, growing, developing — changing.</p>
<p>From the chicken’s point of view, the moment of breakthrough, of cracking the egg, was simply one more step in a long chain of steps that had led to that moment. Granted, it was a big step — but it was hardly the radical transformation that it looked like from the outside. It’s a silly analogy, but then our conventional way of looking at change is no less silly. Everyone looks for the “miracle moment” when “change happens.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change doesn’t happen that way, not for chickens and not for
churches. Using the Verge process as a guide for gaining missional
momentum, let’s journey together through this three-move change</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Imagine (See It)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first priority in mobilizing for mission has to be the redemption of the imagination. We must help people think creatively about how to accomplish the mission of Jesus. There are many well-meaning followers who are stuck in existing paradigms and don’t know what they don’t know. If people can’t see it, they can’t believe it, and if they can’t believe it, they will never do it! What they need is imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four Ways of Engaging Imagination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Austin Stone Church is having success in helping their people see it. They are using at least four ways to engage and inform the imagination of their people: Modeling. Michael Stewart, director of missional communities, started his own missional community in an at-risk neighborhood that reproduced into three new missional communities, including a house church. The best way for people to see it is for leaders to be it!</p>
<p>Pilots. Periodically, they will bring together groups of people and encourage them to pilot new missional endeavors. By piloting first with risk-takers before going into a churchwide transition, you get all the benefit without the responsibility. Pilot projects allow you to experiment without fallout and give you your early stories to tell.</p>
<p>Stories. Tell stories of success in missional community. Stories have embedded within them training and vision. Stories give people a picture of what could be. They are little doses of hope. Stories should always precede the actual churchwide transition process. Start good rumors.</p>
<p>Heroes. Create new heroes. Point to Jesus first, then to the folks who are early adopters and are willing to take risks and step out into missional engagement. Heroes are just stories with faces. Make heroes!</p>
<p>“Real Talk” One of the best ideas for mobilizing people is also the simplest: one-to-one coaching conversations. Reggie Mc Neal, in Missional Renaissance, describes the process used by Peninsula Covenant Church in Redwood City, California, called “Real Talk.” The following five questions can be used between friends, between staff and volunteers, or between a mentor and the person being mentored, Heroes are just to spark the imagination of others toward mission. stories with faces.</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you enjoy doing? Since most of us like</li>
</ol>
<p>Make heroes! to talk about ourselves, this is a great first question. This question is an eye-opener because many have never made the connection that what they love may be a clue to their life mission. In Richard Bolles’ words, “Your mission in life is to be in the place where your deep gladness and the world’s great hunger meet.”3</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Where do you see God at work right now? This question is</li>
</ol>
<p>designed to help people see that God is already at work in their lives. Many of us only look for God at church; this question helps people discover that God is at work in their family, in their neighborhood, and in the place where they work.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What would you like to see God do in your life over the next six</li>
</ol>
<p>twelve months? How can we help? This question is important for the relationship and for missional imagination. This question tells people that you aren’t merely interested in them to fill a slot in a church program; you are genuinely interested in helping them serve in a meaningful way.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>How would you like to serve other people? How can we help?</li>
</ol>
<p>This question helps people focus their ser vice in a particular direction and offers ongoing help toward that end. This question also implicitly reminds people of the truth that spiritual growth occurs most through ser vice.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>How can we pray for you? The conversation ends by taking</li>
</ol>
<p>this all to God. I’d encourage you to ask God for courage to act and for continued direction on this journey, as both are essential for next steps.</p>
<h2>A Crazy Thought</h2>
<p>When the Holy Spirit comes within us, he prompts us to move.</p>
<p>Those first promptings cause us to think and want to behave in ways that were previously unthinkable. The reason why we’ve often credited new believers with being on fire is because this is their first experience of the missionary Spirit at work in their imagination to advance the cause of Jesus.</p>
<p>I recently received a Facebook message from a young adult who is a new believer at Community. She’s never read anything Alan Hirsch or Neil Cole have ever written. If I said something about Forge or New Thing, she might think I was talking about i Tunes’ new music Tuesday. She still has huge sin hang-ups that would The risk of learning: disqualify her in most churches, but inside her heart sometimes to grasp is the beating of the Spirit’s missional impulse dying the new, you have to to get out. She sent the following message to me: let go of the old. “Just a crazy idea, but wouldn’t it be cool if there could be church in random places that wouldn’t be the place you thought of as a traditional place to worship... bars, beaches, and so on... places nonbelievers frequent a little more and feel a little more comfortable. Crazy thought, I know, but you wouldn’t believe how lonely people are in some places like that... maybe its something to pray about. Thanks!” Did you notice how she said, “Crazy thought...”? God is placing those kinds of crazy thoughts in all his believers. We need to get inside their heads and activate the potential that lies within their missional imagination. When that happens, people will make the shift from seeing it to really getting it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Shift (Get It)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the people in a church are able to see it in their mind’s eye, we need them to get it in their head and heart. You know that people are starting to get it when they understand God has sent them. While making this shift, they will begin demonstrating they get it by living it out.</p>
<p>They aren’t yet integrating mission into everyday rhythms and routines of life, but it is showing up from time to time in their life. When this happens, they are making the shift toward the sent life, and the mission of Jesus is on the move! If your people are getting it, their felt experience of the living Christ will be enlarged; mission will beat in their chests, and they will find new missional articulation in word and deed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding mDNA (Apostolic Genius)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As leaders, we are responsible for creating cultures where all six elements (“Jesus is Lord,” disciple-making, missional-incarnational impulse, apostolic environment, organic systems, communitas) of the mDNA are present and thriving. We went into quite a bit of detail about each of those elements in the previous chapters and about how to accentuate the strengths and overcome the weaknesses in a variety of types of churches, from sacramental to micro-missional.</p>
<p>One of the very best things you can do for gaining missional momentum is to have your church go through the mPULSE assessment.4 This is a unique online tool that measures the missional nature of your church. It’s specifically designed to assist in applying concepts unique to the Verge process. The mPULSE assessment will identify the missional strengths and weaknesses of a church, church-plant, missional movement, or organization. It also provides you with a report, and a suggested action plan to aid strategic planning and implementation. All critical for gaining momentum.</p>
<h2>Cultivating Ethos</h2>
<p>Once the six elements of mDNA have been fully released within a faith community, they have tremendous influence over the behavior and practices of each individual in that faith community, because they permanently shift the culture. There is nothing more powerful for mobilizing people for movement than a strong missional ethos or culture. When a faith community has a missional culture that expects every person to be a sent person, all who assimilate into that church or group will likely behave as sent people. Why? Either because that is what attracted them to the group in the first place or because they simply don’t know any other way. Those who aren’t engaged in the mission will feel the dissonance and will often self-select out.</p>
<p>Once the mDNA has been released and informs the ethos of a group of people, it is critical to keep the culture strong. If ethos and culture are the spontaneous patterns of repeated behaviors, we must find ways to reinforce those positive patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>Here are some proven important approaches for gaining missional momentum and keeping the ethos of movement strong:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ordain Every Christ Follower</li>
</ol>
<p>Challenge leaders to ordain every Christ follower. I once stood in front of all our volunteer leaders and gave them our blessing to go and plant churches in a variety of expressions. I left that experience with two feelings: first, an overwhelming sense of God’s approval, and second, a sense that God wanted me to offer that same blessing to our entire church and not just those in lay leadership. That led to the weekend where we ordained more than two thousand adults with the blessing of our church to go to the people and places God had sent them.</p>
<p>Since then, I have given this same challenge at several conferences, and I’m surprised at how much pushback I’ve received. Some is out of fear. Some of this is deserved, since in a nondenominational church like Community it’s much easier to put this into practice than in most denominational churches. No matter what your tribe, if you can find creative ways to give your people language and license, they will sense the approval and commissioning to go. They need biblical language that affirms their calling and empowers them on their mission. And they need license in the form of full permission from the leadership to whom they have submitted.</p>
<p>So be creative and find a way in your context to affirm the sentness of every Christ follower. Ask them to name out loud the particular people or place to which they feel called. Commission them with your blessing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Utilize Symbols</li>
</ol>
<p>Symbols can also be powerful devices for keeping a culture of movement strong. When David Cho gave the women of Yoido Full Gospel Church head coverings as a symbol of his blessing and permission to lead cell groups, the church experienced exponential growth!</p>
<p>This church now has the reputation of being the largest church in percent of the fifty thousand cell groups. The backstory is that as a young pastor, Cho was so driven, he literally went to the largest church building in Seoul, South Korea, and walked it off — all to determine how big it was. He then determined he would build an even bigger church. Cho did build a bigger church building, but in the process he worked so hard, he literally collapsed in the pulpit, which left him flat on his back for much of the next ten years. While he was disabled, he gave head coverings to women and gave them permission to lead and reproduce small cell groups. It was during that decade of ministry that the Full Gospel church exploded! There are at least two takeaways from this remarkable testimony:</p>
<ol>
<li>The clergy had to get out of the way before the church could</li>
</ol>
<p>experience apostolic movement.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The whole people of God — men and women alike — had to</li>
</ol>
<p>be given permission to serve to their fullest capability for the church to reach its full God-given potential.</p>
<p>The catalytic event in this story was giving head coverings to women. This was a powerful permission-giving symbol. Whether we use head coverings, a certificate on a piece of paper, a title given, or prayer of public commissioning, symbols and symbolic actions are powerful ethos builders. The symbolic act of the first apostolic movement was baptism, and it should be the goal of every church to restore that symbol to its full meaning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Standing Ovations</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know what a group values, notice what gets spontaneous applause. At Community, whenever we announce the launch of a new site or a new church, it not only gets spontaneous applause but also gets a standing ovation! As we made the shift to not only reproduce the macro (sites and churches) but also reproduce the micro (missional expressions), we had to teach our people to applaud for the small works of God and not just the big. As a part of our culture shift, we began to intentionally put people on stage who could tell their stories of how God had sent them and was using them to make an impact in their neighborhood, workplace, and third places of life. As they would leave the stage, the campus pastor would begin the applause, and the rest of the congregation would follow. What gets applause is often what gets done.</p>
<p>The nurturing of a strong missional culture will create momentum through church multiplication and the continuous mobilization of Christ followers into all domains of life. As the momentum grows, an apostolic movement will burst forth.</p>
<h2>Developing Practices</h2>
<p>The goal for every believer is to move from missional imagination to missional innovation, from creatively being able to see it to having the courage to do it. But in between they must get it; they have to understand it and desire to make the shift to being a sent people.</p>
<p>There is nothing more powerful in making the shift or in reinforcing a movement culture than the ongoing practices that are a part of the daily routine and rhythm of the church. These practices are consistent with Apostolic Genius/mDNA and take their cue from the ethos of the community. These routine and rhythmic practices are what create the momentum in individual believers and entire churches that is so essential to movement making.</p>
<p>Great examples of missional practices are what the Soma Communities call their “rhythms.” Highly reminiscent of the BELLS practices of Small Boat Big Sea, described in chapter 6, the following rhythms are lived out routinely in the life of the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Story-formed. We know and submit our lives to the story of God</li>
</ul>
<p>while also becoming familiar with each other’s stories and the stories of our culture.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Listen. We submit to God through consistent backward and forward listening. We also listen to others, our culture/community, and ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate. We gather together as a community to celebrate God’s</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>extravagant blessings in Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bless. We intentionally bless others through words, gifts, or</li>
</ul>
<p>actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat. We regularly eat meals with others to invite them into a</li>
</ul>
<p>gospel community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recreate. We take time to rest, play, create, and restore beauty in</li>
</ul>
<p>ways that reflect God and the work of the gospel to others.</p>
<p>Again, these specific practices of other apostolic movements are not shared in order for you to adopt them indiscriminately. Rather we hope these will inspire you to come up with your own unique practices that are consistent with your own cultural expression of the mDNAGod has put within you. But for these practices to create missional momentum in every follower of Jesus, you should keep these two guidelines in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Routine. Make sure these practices can fit into the daily routine of life. These practices should be applicable to all people in your context and work into the routine of life. This isn’t because you’re trying to make it easy and accommodate the mission to a certain lifestyle; instead you’re trying to make the mission a part of everyday life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhythm. There should also be a rhythm to these practices. It’s</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ideal if these practices can be lived out in some daily expression as individuals and in weekly expression as a community.</p>
<p>As these practices are being lived out routinely and rhythmically by individual people, you will be able to feel the growing missional momentum and know that apostolic movement is just ahead.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Innovate (Do It)</li>
</ol>
<p>The third phase moves a church beyond imagining or understanding toward every believer living out the dream God has for his or her life. Each person is now, on a daily basis, thinking and behaving like one sent by God. When they are challenged with being a part of a missional movement, they can honestly say, “I’m doing it.” Mark Dwyer, a real estate broker from Plainfield, I llinois, noticed that churches don’t always do a great job of reaching men. But he knew who did: golf courses. He couldn’t always get guys to come to church, but they would always go golfing with him. So he started intentionally taking guys golfing and talking to them about life, family, and spiritual stuff. Pretty soon he had so many guys golfing with him that he bought a membership at a local course. The process gave him the idea for the Divine Back Nine.5 He negotiated a deal with a golf course to rent the back nine during the early morning hours. He then got other guys to invite their friends, and as of last year he has had more than 250 different golfers participate. They golf in the morning, and a bunch of the guys stick around in the “members-only lounge” to talk about life, family, and spiritual stuff and sometimes study the Bible together. The results? Unemployed men were reenergized and finding purpose in their lonely days. Workaholics were challenged to put life in perspective. Depressed men were finding excitement and joy. And guys were finding their way back to God. When it comes to missional engagement, Mark is doing it.</p>
<h2>The Flywheel</h2>
<p>Before there is the rush of momentum, these three phases will be experienced over and over again. Afollower of Jesus will be inspired by the creativity of the Holy Spirit to reimagine the call of their mission.</p>
<p>They will grow in their love and understanding of who Jesus is and what it means to be an apprentice of Christ. Afollower will be diligent about the daily practices of followership but will continually be called to deeper levels of commitment. These aren’t three steps a Christ follower takes and then gets an Ain discipleship class. This is a journey of apprenticeship with Jesus, guided by his missionary Spirit. This is a process that takes time for a church and the people of that church and must be nurtured with patience before something new is born.</p>
<p>The Verge process is the flywheel that turns again and again. With every rotation of the see it, get it, do it Verge process, believers see the mission of Jesus move forward with greater and greater force until the cumulative force of their momentum is an exponential apostolic movement (fig. 31). multiplication people on mission apostolic church planting in every sphere movement</p>
<h2>Figure 31</h2>
<p>When every church is on mission multiplying other life-giving churches, and every follower of Jesus is on mission catalyzing difference-making ministry in all spheres of life, we will have a genuine apostolic movement!</p>
<p>Alan’s Response to “Gaining Missional Momentum” It’s critical to remember at this point that Apostolic Genius not only describes the elements that come together to make up the phenomenon of exponential Jesus movements. As a dynamic paradigm, it also provides leaders with an interpretive grid, a working framework, for determining how we see things. As a distinct paradigm, it’s a way of looking at all aspects of church through the highly distinctive lens of apostolic movement. I want to limit my response to Dave’s chapter here by showing how leaders can use the Apostolic Genius paradigm both as a diagnostic tool as well as a means of developing strategy.</p>
<h2>Taking Your mPULSE</h2>
<p>To assist in this, I have been involved in developing the online instrument Dave has already mentioned called mPULSE, which helps determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of any given system.6 The mPULSE assessment is a thoroughly accessible diagnostic tool designed to help move churches to the Verge. Designed to work with this book as well as with the very practical workbook The Forgotten Ways Handbook, it assesses the presence and strengths of each of the six elements of mDNA. It then provides the respondents with a report, and a suggested action plan to aid the strategic planning and implementation Dave suggests in this chapter.</p>
<h2>The Systems Approach</h2>
<p>Remember, Verge church thinking is a form of systems-thinking.</p>
<p>To assess the strengths and weaknesses of your organization in relation to Apostolic Genius, it is critical to engage a systems-thinking approach. Asystem is always made up of a series of interdependent and interrelating parts; if you change one element in the system, you will indirectly impact the whole system — for good or ill. Because everything is interconnected, it isn’t good enough to simply focus on one part as if it were a silver bullet, a prepackaged answer to all our problems. All elements, both individually and as a whole, have to be factored into our thinking. And because this is a system, you can use any element of mDNA as an entry point, a lens into the organization that allows you to see the other elements in its light.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in systems-thinking, weaknesses will always tend to undermine the whole system. As Peter Senge, the master of organizational development, taught us, systems approaches are sometimes counterintuitive; the aim is largely to identify and remove obstacles and not necessarily bolster the apparent strengths.7 While we need to use our strengths, we definitely have to see the weaknesses in the system as the primary focus of strategic activity.</p>
<p>Aleading application of strategic systems-thinking in churchgrowth circles is given to us by Christian Schwarz, founder of Natural Church Development (NCD).8 NCD talks about identifying the church’s “quality factors.” Furthermore, Schwarz believes that a church could only grow as far as its “minimum factor.” To illustrate this, he compared his (eight) quality factors principles to the individual pieces (staves) of wood that are combined to make a barrel. If in a barrel (picture one without a top on it) one stave is shorter than the rest, then the volume/capacity of the barrel to carry water is limited to the shortest stave. To increase the volume capacity of the barrel, one has to increase the length of the shortest stave. Likewise, by measuring the strongest and weakest of the six mDNA elements, mPULSE identifies relative weaknesses and strengths in the system.</p>
<p>Because Apostolic Genius (like biological DNA in your own body) resides in the smallest part and is laced throughout the system, the mPULSE can be taken at any level of the organization. You can use it to assess the organization as a whole, a new church-plant, or something as small and organic as a house church. And I suggest that it be done on regular occasions. This will allow for adjustments of strategy as weaknesses and strengths shift. Furthermore, I suggest that you always identify the two weakest elements and work on them.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis and Strategy</h2>
<p>Now, you don’t have to take the mPULSE test to be able to detect your weaknesses and strengths, but it ought to take a lot of time and guesswork out of the equation. It can be found at www. theforgottenways. org/mpulse.9 But if you should chose to bypass the test, then I suggest that together you prayerfully discuss the six elements and discern which ones are your strengths and why, and which ones are your weaknesses and why. Certainly, you should get feedback from three levels: key leaders, staff, and other stakeholders in the organization.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the relative weaknesses and strengths (diagnosis), focus your strategic effort on how you’re going to develop the weakest ones so as to strengthen the whole. Use this book and The Forgotten Ways Handbook when you need to problem solve, innovate, and develop strategy.</p>
<p>Often the other elements of mDNA can provide the solution.</p>
<p>Focusing on the weakest element will bring the other elements in to bear. Remember, God has already given each church everything it needs to get the job done! It’s there; you just have to look for it and activate it. The solution to your problem is already present in your inherent coding, in Apostolic Genius itself.</p>
<p>For instance, if discipleship turns up as the lowest minimum factor, you will want to identify what exactly is inhibiting Christlike development. What activities are you doing to create dependencies?</p>
<p>What tools might you use or develop to enhance disciple-making and apprenticeship? How might you get the maximum people on the journey?</p>
<p>Clearly, developing a set of practices will be vital here as well.</p>
<p>But remember, the other elements contain part of the answer. One way in which discipleship might be enhanced is through cultivating communitas experiences, helping the church experience the thrill of encountering each other, and finding God again, in missional experiences. Another way might be to connect each believer with his or her God-given vocation from Ephesians 4, and so on. When people operate within their calling/gifting, they will come alive in ways they haven’t before.</p>
<p>Another example: If organic systems is your weakest mDNA, then look at places where power and function can be effectively decentralized. Discern what factors in the system inhibit the movement vibe. Watch for control issues, as movements are by nature low-control but high-accountability. Also, the church that Jesus designed is built for reproduction; do an assessment on why you are not reproducing.</p>
<p>Don’t start new projects that cannot be easily reproduced by nonprofessionals! And remember the both/and equation — in all likelihood, there is going to be some form of hybrid. Nonetheless, identify the organizational hindrances to growth, and as far as is possible remove them without damaging the integrity of the whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not Losing Our First/Primary Love</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only other qualification that ought to be made is about the central defining element in Apostolic Genius: Jesus is Lord. I would suggest that this always remains the number one issue. Everything must be constantly referenced against him. And even though the mPULSE test does probe the church’s Christological awareness, you should just assume that this is an invariable constant and you should always be developing your understanding and experience of God in Jesus.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. Recently I was engaging with a group of Anabaptist seminarians. As many readers know, Anabaptism has always taken the Gospels seriously and Jesus as the focal point of their spirituality.</p>
<p>On the whole, Anabaptism is pacifist in theology and orientation; their view of Jesus as peacemaker makes them committed to nonviolent action and witness. Wanting to probe their Christology a bit further, I applauded their commitment to this clear aspect of Jesus’ teachings, and then I asked them the question, “What do Anabaptists do with the distinctive image of Jesus revealed in thebook of Revelation?” In Revelation, we are presented with a picture of an altogether warrior-like Christ figure, who has a burning sword coming out of his mouth and is opening up divine seals that unleash judgment, with all its associated violence, on the earth. My question caused a big stir because it challenged their prescribed view of Jesus and begged the question as to how they might have simply co-opted Jesus to be an idealization of their vision of the world — the über-Anabaptist of all time, but still an Anabaptist. But surely Jesus is much more than that.</p>
<p>We never reach the end of our comprehension of him, our experience of him, and our becoming like him.</p>
<p>In other words, all lovers of Jesus need their Christology to expand and perhaps need to be less ideological in their interpretation of the gospel. And if the Anabaptists, who have so lovingly centered on the life and teachings of Jesus, have troubles integrating him, then how much more the Reformed tradition (for instance), with its deeply ingrained historical tendency to short-circuit around Jesus and focus on Paul? To what degree do Reformed churches need a thorough re Jesusing, a recalibration of theology and practice around the life and teachings of Jesus? What about the more fundamentalist traditions that so easily become belligerent and legalistic? The high church traditions that tend to lose the simplicity of Jesus’ way in the complexities of high, sacerdotal religion? The point of all this? We all need to be re Jesused. All the time. This is the central lesson of the letters to the seven churches in Revelation 1 – 3: Jesus is Lord, and we all have issues to deal with in relating to him.</p>
<p>So let Jesus be Lord, and in our submission to the whole Christ let us lovingly, prayerfully, and strategically lead the church onto the Verge. Put on the mind of Christ. Think with the genius of Apostolic Genius — it belongs to your church.</p>

<h2>— H. RICHARD NIEBUHR,</h2>
<h2>THEOLOGICAL ETHICIST</h2>
<p>Our God has always been on the move. Even from the very start, God has existed in movement. Genesis tells us, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was barren, with no form of life; it was under a roaring ocean covered with darkness. But the Spirit of God was moving over the water” (Gen. 1:1 – 2 CEV, emphasis added). From the birth of time, God has been moving. And just as God has been on the move, his people have been on the move with him. When the Gentiles were without knowledge of the one true God, God sent Abram, telling him to go to a foreign land: “Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you” (Gen. 12:1 – 2).</p>
<p>When we read about the incarnation in John 1:14 — “The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood” (MSG) — the text is describing God moving from his own time and space continuum into ours. And when the Spirit of God comes within his followers, they also begin to move: “The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit” (John 3:8).</p>
<p>If you’re a lover of God and a follower of Jesus, you will be moved.</p>
<p>Ayoung man named Patrick was once sold into Irish slavery after being kidnapped from his native Britain. After he escaped and returned home, he was moved one night by a vision of an Irishman who handed him a letter titled “The Voice of the Irish.” As he read the letter, he heard the voices of those he knew in Ireland crying out, “We beg you, come and walk with us again.” Patrick recalled he “was stung intensely in my heart so that I could read no more and thus I awoke.” The year was AD 405, and Patrick became the first missionary to move outside the Roman Empire with the good news of Jesus. It took six years of hunger, loneliness, and cold for God to move Patrick from a teenager with an inherited nominal faith to an apostle to Ireland.</p>
<p>Once God moved Patrick, his mission met with great success. He baptized thousands, influenced the halt of the Irish slave trade, and fueled a missionary movement through the Celtic church that lasted the next five hundred years.</p>
<p>God was on the move and continued to move.</p>
<p>It was 1755, in rural North Carolina, when God moved Pastor Shubal Stearns and the Sandy Creek Baptist Church. Historians describe this movement: “In seventeen years [this church] has spread branches westward as far as the great river Mississippi; southward as far as Georgia; eastward to the sea and Chesapeake Bay; and northward to the waters of the Potomac; it, in seventeen years, is the mother, grandmother and great-grandmother to forty-two churches, from which sprang 125 ministers.” And more than 250 years later, the people of Sandy Creek Baptist Church who moved with God are still being held up as an example.1 God is still on the move today. Over the last sixty years, the Chinese church has moved with the Spirit and seen the number of Christ followers grow from about 2 million to more than 130 million! Roland Allen, a missionary to China, explains how he saw the Spirit of God move in the Chinese people: If we seek for the cause which produces rapid expansion when a new faith seizes hold of men who feel able and free to propagate it spontaneously of their own initiative, we find its roots in a certain natural instinct.... This instinctive force which drives men even at the risk of life itself to impart to others a new-found joy.... But in Christians there is more than this natural instinct. The Spirit of Christ is a Spirit who longs for, and strives after, the salvation of the souls of men, and that Spirit dwells in them. That Spirit converts the natural instinct into a longing for the conversion of others which is indeed divine in its source and character.2 There is something moving inside each of us and inside every community of faith — and it is our God who is always in motion.</p>
<p>Movement isn’t new. Movement is God at work. Movement is the way God has always worked. Movement is how Jesus’ mission will be accomplished.</p>
<h2>Movement Blink</h2>
<p>We’ve spent the breadth of this book challenging you with a change process that can restore the primal apostolic mission that was meant to be the driving force of every church and follower of Jesus. To fully implement the process of imagine, shift, and innovate, resulting in missional movementum, will take months and probably years. And it well should. But for those of you who are less patient, like me, let’s try a blink test.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell’s bestseller Blink introduced us to a psychologist who learned to predict whether a marriage would last based on a few minutes of observing a couple. He also told about a tennis coach who knew when a player would double-fault before the racket even made contact with the ball. The point is that often our first intuitions are right, and first impressions are lasting ones.</p>
<p>Gladwell describes the main subject of his book as “thin-slicing” our ability to gauge what is really important from a very narrow period of experience. In other words, this is an idea that spontaneous decisions are often as good as — or even better than — carefully planned and considered ones. What follows is a blink test for your church to determine if you currently have movement momentum. Read each question to determine if you’re moving in the right direction. Don’t think too long. Just blink.</p>
<p>Blink: Is your church more interested in quality programs or quality people? What is the blink on your church in regard to spiritual formation? The promise that church programming alone will make your life better has been exposed. It doesn’t work. Everyday living is where spiritual development is worked out. Loving God and loving our neighbors cannot be fulfilled in a church building. Ask yourself, is your church propagating an implicit assumption that you can live out your entire spiritual journey as a part of a church-sponsored or church-operated activity? Or is the emphasis more on the discovery of every person’s unique call and the good work that God has prepared for them to do? Is the emphasis at your church on recruiting and finding a person to fill every slot or on the notion that every person has a mission and we need to help them discover it?</p>
<p>If the blink on your church is that it is more concerned about quality programs, then there is no movement momentum. But if they are willing to kill a program and put life-on-life relationships and the development of people first, there is movementum.</p>
<p>Blink: Is your church as passionate about sending people out as they are about bringing people in? “Now that was church!” was my friend’s reaction as we got back into the car around noon on Sunday and headed back home together. Where had we been? 329 North Dearborn in Chicago, home of the House of Blues. I wasn’t teaching that weekend, so we went to one of our Saturday night ser vices and then on Sunday morning headed to the House of Blues for their Gospel Brunch. It was an amazing experience! They had a buffet that included a place to create your own omelet, fresh made-to-order waffles, a salad station, a seafood station, and a carving station with every kind of meat.</p>
<p>In addition, they brought in the best gospel music in the entire city.</p>
<p>They even had a quick devotional that mentioned Jesus. And all of it was in a world-class venue with great lighting and sound. We got all that for $37.50 per person — far less than a tithe! And my friend half joked, “Now that was church!” If you want to create a great place to bring people to, then the House of Blues Gospel Brunch is the best model! That is what they do. They provide the best music, best entertainment, and best food in a world-class venue. Why? Simple: to attract you and your money.</p>
<p>Yes, they did mention Jesus, and they challenged us to be a friend to somebody today, but that was only to make the experience more authentic. There was no interest in mobilizing people for mission in the neighborhoods that surround North Dearborn.</p>
<p>If the blink on your church is that they are only interested in creating a place to bring people and are not equally passionate about sending people, then there is no movementum. If the communal conversation is all about nickels and noses (offering and attendance), there is not movementum. But if the blink is that you see a growing interest in church planting, reproducing new outwardly focused groups and teams, the birth of missional communities, causes of restorative justice and citywide transformation, then you have movementum.</p>
<p>Blink: Is your church content with addition, or does it long to see exponential reproduction? What is your blink on your church’s strategy for growth and expansion? Addition is a good thing, but exponential reproduction is the stuff of movements. Addition provides incremental growth, but multiplication produces exponential growth. Addition often relies on the pull of event-based ministry, while multiplication comes through life-on-life apprenticeships at every level: Christ followers, leaders, and church planters.</p>
<p>Neil Cole, who has dedicated his life to trying to discover the secret of starting spontaneous church multiplication movements, reminds us, Because addition is faster in the beginning and multiplication takes time, we are often content with growth through addition.</p>
<p>We are easily seduced by the more immediate success and instant gratification of addition instead of waiting for the momentum that can build with multiplying. The success promised to addition is hard to turn down. It is so rare to have a church ministry grow at all that one growing fast with addition is desirable enough. It is hard to turn away from the glamour of potentially being labeled the fastest-growing church. It is difficult as well for leaders to turn away from the crowds and invest in the few, but Jesus Himself did exactly that.3</p>
<p>The question of incremental addition versus exponential reproduction applies to everything: new converts, Christ followers, small groups or teams, campuses and churches. If your church has the heart for the long view of exponential reproduction and not the immediacy of addition, then movement momentum is coming.</p>
<p>Blink: Is your church holding on to control, or are they leading with a harmonious blend of order and chaos? Control or an intermingling orderly chaos — what’s your blink? As a church invests in people and sends them out on mission over and over again with the dream of an exponential movement, things will get out of control. The question is not if it is out of control but what is the reflex of the church? Will they have done the hard work of people development and then embrace them with trust because of what they have invested in them, or will they fall back on policymaking and pull in the reigns? Control is an illusion: it’s never something you grab; it can only be granted to you by others. This does not mean that the leadership of a church should surrender to anarchy. Not at all. Rather than trying to lead by grasping at control, they must move forward with shared values that align people and communities of great diversity to bring about catalytic movements. If your church is courageous enough to not try to control but trust and nurture what they have given life to, then movementum is the reward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If in a blink you can see a growing momentum of movement
within your church, that is great news. If you came away from the
blink saying either “not much momentum here” or “I can’t tell for
into a missional movement, and my role as an apostolic leader, I am
tasks leaders must steward with all their might if they want to see the
that are equally vivid.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Vivid Vision</h2>
<p>While in college, a friend of mine challenged me, “What if your church never has a thousand people in it?” I remember thinking her notion seemed ridiculous. I couldn’t imagine it, and I walked away very content with my vision for the church I would plant one day. Yes, I was very naive and extremely green, but in my own mind I could clearly see a thousand people and felt like I had a plan that could make it happen. It was after we planted Community Christian Church that I was challenged again — this time by a respected leader — to reevaluate my vision: “Take your ministry goals and multiply them by one million.” He continued, “If your vision is to reach one hundred people, try multiplying it by one million. Now ask yourself, what do you have to do differently to fulfill that vision?” This was stretching my imagination. If I multiplied one thousand by one million, that would be one billion people. How could we ever reach one billion people? That was about one-sixth of the world population. I certainly couldn’t do it through one church, on one campus in one city. I would need to mobilize every person into every realm of life. Everything about the way I would see the future of this church and the people who made it up had to be drastically altered!</p>
<p>Ever since then, when we huddle with our team at Community or New Thing, we begin with the end in mind: imagining a movement of one billion people finding their way back to God. Outrageous? Yes!</p>
<p>Have we seen that vision fulfilled? Definitely not. Not even close. But God has used this vision to build a church of not just one thousand but thousands, and networks of tens of thousands. And we are just getting started!</p>
<p>Avivid vision for a movement has to be far more than quantitative; it must also have a creative quality to it that captures not only the imagination of the leader but also the imagination of others. Matt Carter, the lead pastor of the Austin Stone Church, was given a vivid vision from God that took hold of the hearts of people in his church.</p>
<p>The church had outgrown the suburban high school they were meeting in, and the leadership began to ask if it was time to build a permanent facility. They hired a broker to help them locate a piece of property and started looking everywhere, in the nearby suburbs and in the city of Austin. At the same time, Matt was taking a sabbatical.</p>
<p>During a time of prayer, Matt was reading a passage of Scripture from which God spoke to him: Amos 5. The passage was all about God’s disdain for the way Israel had been blessed but refused to be a blessing to the poor and oppressed. Then he read verse 23: “Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.” His church was known for their great worship, and the verse and passage stuck in his mind, causing him to reflect and pray on what it might look like to move the church into one of the poorest communities in Austin, St. John.</p>
<p>Three days later, while Mark was still on sabbatical, his phone rang, and it was a call from the church’s Realtor. He said, “Matt, I’ve found fifteen acres; the price is great, but I’m sure you won’t want it.” Matt asked, “Why?” Then the Realtor said, “Well, it’s in St. John.” There was silence on both ends of the phone.</p>
<p>Matt finally spoke. “I think we are supposed to buy that property.” Right now they are in the process of moving this Caucasian, twentysomething, upwardly mobile church into their first permanent facility, in one of the most underresourced neighborhoods in Austin.</p>
<p>Matt admits, “I know the problems we could bring to this neighborhood; I’ve read the books and I know we could really mess things up. We aren’t the great white hope. We are coming in with open hearts and open hands, saying how can we serve you? We just believe this is what God is telling us to do next.” The crystal-clear vision for a missional movement is birthed in and of the imagination of an apostolic leader. When the leadership allows God’s creative Spirit to captivate their mind’s eye, they begin to see a whole new future for the people they are leading. They see changed lives. They see transformed communities. They begin to see the world as God sees it. And together they move forward into that and the making of an apostolic movement.</p>
<h2>Vivid Values</h2>
<p>Then there are those seasons when the vision is not seen with 20/20 vision, and as a leader, you find yourself asking, “God, where are you taking us next?” It is during those times that the values of the movement will sustain you. As important as it is to have a vivid vision, it is even more important to have vivid values. It is the values that remind you of who you are as you move from point Ato point Bof a vision. It is the values that provide a compass for those times when you are walking in a fog.</p>
<p>Dee Hock, who is the founder and CEO emeritus of the Visa Corporation and now a legendary organizational guru, knows the power of values to a movement. One of his favorite tricks to play on an audience is to ask, “How many of you recognize this?” while holding out his own Visa card. Every hand in the room goes up.</p>
<p>Next Hock asks, “How many of you can tell me who owns this multitrillion dollar corporation?” Silence.</p>
<p>Then he asks, “Who knows where it is headquartered?” More silence.</p>
<p>“Can anyone tell me how it’s governed?” Even more confused silence. No one has the slightest idea, because no one has ever thought about it, even though they use Visa ser vices almost every day. And that, says Hock, is exactly how it ought to be.</p>
<p>“The better an organization is, the less obvious it is,” he says.</p>
<p>In Birth of the Chaordic Age, Hock tells about the rise of Visa and the creation of the word chaordic. The chaordic infrastructure of Visa was designed to encourage as much competition and initiative as possible — in other words, chaos — while building in values that held the organization together — or in order. With that structure, he built a multitrillion dollar global corporation that has no visible headquarters. Hock explains the power of a chaordic organization: “Purpose [vision] and principle [values], clearly understood and articulated, and commonly shared, are the genetic code of any healthy organization.</p>
<p>To the degree that you hold purpose and principles in common among you, you can dispense with command and control. People will know how to behave in accordance with them, and they’ll do it in thousands of unimaginable, creative ways. The organization will become a vital, living set of beliefs.” The challenge Hock gives to every organization is to marry a solid core with a changing periphery.</p>
<p>Chaordic is a perfect description of the organization behind an apostolic movement. It encourages dreaming and initiative by all of God’s people (chaos), while also establishing a clear set of values that align everyone for the greater kingdom good (order). Avivid set of values everyone buys into is what allows you and your community to move through the stages of imagination, paradigm shifting, and innovation unencumbered toward a true missional movementum. Without those vivid values, you will not have a chaordic community; you will have only chaos, because it is the values that provide the order.</p>
<h2>Eight Movement Rules</h2>
<p>As we think about the vision and values that make an apostolic movement, it’s also wise to lean into those who have gone before us and those who have more experience than us. The good news is, there is more and more being written about movements. And within those texts are helpful lists of characteristics of missionary movements, the universal elements found in every church-planting movement, and the catalysts for igniting movements. As we’ve perused the literature, rather than repeat those lists, I have put together a compilation of what we call Eight Movement Rules.4</p>
<ol>
<li>There Are No Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>The first rule in any movement is that rules don’t rule, values do!</p>
<p>There may be rules, expectations, or guidelines, but that isn’t what makes a movement move. What motivates a movement is a common set of shared values for which the community is willing to trade their very lives. In The Starfish and the Spider, the authors point out that rules are someone else’s idea of what you should do, and rules are something that is done to you. Values are something you believe in and hold dear. Values are the very things the community calls norms and insists we all hold to. In a movement it is values that rule.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Small Rules Jesus started this apostolic movement with a single small group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus used the parable of leaven to show how small things can make a big impact. He also referred to the smallest of seeds as having massive potential for earthshaking results. In Church 3.0, Neil Cole champions the power of small things: “Why is small so big? Small does not cost a lot. Small is easy to reproduce. Small is more easily changed and exchanged. Small is mobile. Small is harder to stop. Small is intimate.</p>
<p>Small is simple. Small infiltrates easier. Small is something people think they can do. Big doesn’t do any of these things. We can change the world more quickly by becoming much smaller.”5 Big can be good, but in a movement the small rules!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Simple Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>If the message is complex, it will not be easily remembered, understood, lived out, or transferred from person to person. But if the message is powerful and simple, it will be easily remembered, understood, lived out, and passed with viral mobility from one generation of followers to the next. Roland Allen writes in Missionary Methods: St.</p>
<p>Paul’s or Ours, Thus, St. Paul seems to have left his newly founded churches with a simple system of gospel teaching, two sacraments, a tradition of the main facts of the death and resurrection, and the Old Testament. There was apparently no form of ser vice, except of course the form of the sacraments, nor any form of prayer, unless indeed he taught the Lord’s Prayer.... This seems to us remarkably little. And yet it is possible that it was precisely the simplicity and brevity of the teaching which constituted its strength.... By teaching the simplest elements in the simplest form to the many, and by giving them the means by which they could for themselves gain further knowledge, by leaving them to meditate upon these few fundamental truths, and to teach one another what they could discover, St. Paul ensured that his converts should really master the most important things.6 If you want your message to go viral, remember: simple rules!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Reproducible Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>I gnore this rule, and you will never see a movement. I ntegral to every movement of every kind is an infrastructure that is rapidly reproducing at every level. In Church 3.0, Neil Cole gives us the diagram in figure 32, which shows how reproduction in an apostolic movement will naturally occur at every level of complexity, beginning at the smallest and simplest level. It should never stop at any level but continue to fuel the whole through reproduction at each stage.</p>
<p>Natural Phases of Organic Church Development movements to macro churches if you can’t reproduce disciples, leaders you’ll never reproduce leaders disciples if you can’t reproduce leaders, you’ll never reproduce churches if you can’t reproduce churches, you’ll never see movements reproducing reproducing reproducing reproducing from micro Figure 32 In his book Church Planting Movements, missional movement expert David Garrison makes this the first of a five-part definition for a church-planting movement: “First, a church-planting movement reproduces rapidly. Within a very short time, newly planted churches are already starting new churches that follow the same pattern of rapid reproduction.... Movements always outstrip the population growth rate as they race toward reaching the entire people group.”7 For a movement to move, you have to let the small, simple, and reproducing rule!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Apprentice Rules Jesus knew this rule. The very first action that Jesus took when catalyzing his movement was to recruit twelve apprentices. “ ‘Come, follow me,’ Jesus said, ‘and I will make you fishers of men’ ” (Matt.</li>
</ol>
<p>4:19). He was calling them into an apprenticeship and giving them instructions that they would do the same with others. Two thousand years later, the Jesus movement has reached billions and billions and continues to move forward into eternity.</p>
<p>In thebook Exponential: How You and Your Friends Can Start a Missional Church Movement, my brother Jon and I champion the strategic role of apprenticeship in movements: “If a movement is to begin with you, then it begins with you being an apprentice. The core competency of any movement is apprenticeship.... This fundamental principle of reproduction is so often and so easily overlooked. Agifted communicator can attract a huge crowd; a charismatic leader can create tremendous energy and a talented writer can sell books by the millions. But if that teacher, leader or writer wants to see a missional movement they must become and surround themselves with apprentices.”8 David Garrison calls apprenticeship “on-the-job training” and offers up the following benefits of apprenticeship:</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for exponential multiplication of training that is able</li>
</ol>
<p>keep pace with exponential church multiplication.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It can be transmitted with or without written materials, which</li>
</ol>
<p>makes it accessible to nonliterate as well as literate trainees.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It is interpersonal and relational. Because it can take place</li>
</ol>
<p>in restaurants, public parks, or sidewalk coffee shops, it stays below the radar of government opposition.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The requirement to immediately pass on the teaching is reinforced in the minds and lives of those involved in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Break the apprentice rule, and the penalty will be never seeing an apostolic missional movement.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Network Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Of all the movement rules, the network rule is the one most often overlooked. When observing a movement, we are enamored by the mass of its size and intrigued by the smallness of it parts, and so we miss that what is holding it together is an infrastructure of networks.</p>
<p>Alan does a great job of discussing network theory in The Forgotten Ways: “If the Apostolic Genius expresses itself in a movement ethos, it forms itself around a network structure. And once again this tends to be very different from what we’ve come to expect from our general concept of church. So what do these networks look like?” a chain network a hub network an all-channel network</p>
<h2>Figure 33</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chain network. The most decentralized network, with each link</li>
</ul>
<p>further removed from the first and only connected to the one before and after it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hub network. This network is more centralized, though not necessarily hierarchical, because all units connect to a central unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All-channel network. This is the hardest network to initiate and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>maintain, but it’s growing increasingly easy because of technological innovations that make connections more possible.</p>
<p>Within this network, it’s possible to have a variety of other networks (hub and chain) also functioning.</p>
<p>All these network forms can be used effectively in any organization or movement, for good (like Alcoholics Anonymous) or evil (terrorist cells). But when you couple Apostolic Genius with networked structures, you have in front of you the potential for world redemption.</p>
<p>That rules.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The Sustainable Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how we know that whatever is sustainable rules in a movement: if it isn’t sustainable, it isn’t reproducible, and if it isn’t reproducible, you will never have a movement. Steve Addison, in his book Movements That Change the World, explains, “Methods must be simple enough so they can be reproduced easily, rapidly and sustainably.”9 Then he gives us the following chart of unsustainable and sustainable church-planting strategies:</p>
<blockquote>

<ol start="8">
<li>The Spirit Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>The last rule goes back to the basics of mDNA: that Jesus is Lord.</p>
<p>Our Father, who sent our Lord, sent his Spirit to guide us and to rule over us. So when the Spirit of the Lord moves, we move. When he rests, we take a Sabbath alongside him. There are times when a movement of God breaks forth that doesn’t follow all that we’ve laid out in this book. Why? The Spirit rules.</p>
<p>David Garrison says that is the reason why “prayer permeates church-planting movements. Whether it’s the Korean Church rising at four in the morning for a two-hour prayer time, or Spanish Gypsies ‘going to the mountain’ as they call their all night prayer vigils, church-planting movements are steeped in prayer.” God is on the move. God is moving within you and me and every community of faith, because our God’s mission is always in motion.</p>
<p>Movement isn’t new. Movement is God at work. Movement is the way God has always worked. Movement is how Jesus’ mission will be accomplished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan’s Response to “The Making of an Apostolic Movement”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I think of what it takes to mobilize movements, I think it comes down to understanding, activating, shaping, and participating in the inherent potentials of the people of God. I always remind myself that every church has everything it needs to get its job done: we have the life-transforming message of the gospel, the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, the blessing of the Father, and a communitas of people called to be a witnessing ecclesia in a given place. And as we’ve seen, this ecclesia — or at least the possibility of ecclesia — is in everyone (seed g forest; spark g fire). The church of Jesus is perfectly designed for world transformation. We are meant to be a high-impact people-movement. When we aren’t being that, then I suspect it’s something we are doing that is blocking this potential.</p>
<p>The Professionalization of Ministry I have little doubt that the biggest blockage to people-movement is the professionalization of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It has two effects: (1) it limits ministry to an elite group which inevitably replaces the priesthood of all believers/apprentices, and (2) it lets the people of God (the laos) off the hook of their God-given calling to be apprentices who are agents of the King in every sphere and domain.10 If we are going to mobilize a movement, we have to unleash the power of God’s people.</p>
<p>Steve Addison rightly notes that missionary movements spread through the efforts of ordinary people. The rapid spread of the gospel requires the efforts of nonprofessionals who are not dependent on external funding and are not strictly controlled.</p>
<p>Converts must immediately begin sharing their faith “We need a kingdomand planting new churches. The role of key leaders is shaped view of the to model effective ministry; they recruit and deploy church, not a churchworkers, then train them on the job.11 shaped view of the As a church historian, he traces the massive influence and growth of the Methodist movement kingdom.” directly to the activation, training, and empower- —Reggie Mc Neal ing of ordinary people; it grew from a little over 2 percent of the churchgoing population in 1776 to 34 percent in</p>
<ol start="1850">
<li>By activating the so-called laity through deliberate discipleship</li>
</ol>
<p>processes, by 1850 the Methodists had four thousand circuit riders (church planters), almost eight thousand local preachers, and over one million members.12 Addison says, “This achievement would have been impossible without the mobilization of ordinary people — white and black, young and old, men and women — and the removal of artificial barriers to their engagement in significant leadership as class leaders, local workers, and itinerant preachers.” It had completely outgrown all the more top-heavy institutional forms and grew primarily from conversions to Christ.</p>
<p>But mobilization must also take into account issues of sustainability, leadership, organization, and empowerment. The resources for this are all contained within the Apostolic Genius complex as it works its way through the ethos and practices of missional movements. But in addition to activating Apostolic Genius, established churches wishing to transition to Verge church will also require significant change management skills. Leaders do well to hone their skills in this regard, because systems most often resist change. Here are some hints in that direction (excuse the tacky P-alliteration, but it’s useful for my waning memory):</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you’re operating out of the right paradigm. Don’t</li>
</ul>
<p>assume people get it. Keep telling the alternative story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear process. If you don’t follow something like the one</li>
</ul>
<p>below, develop your own, but make sure that the processing isn’t left to chance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be patient. As something of a hothead, especially in my younger</li>
</ul>
<p>years, I wish I could have understood this more back then. As far as complex systems go, what you can’t achieve in one decade, you will in the next. Be patient and let process and paradigm do their work!</p>
<ul>
<li>Power is necessary for any form of social change. It’s the kind</li>
</ul>
<p>of power you use that makes the difference. Follow Jesus here.</p>
<p>Don’t be naive about the nature of power. We struggle with dysfunctional forms of power entrenched in religious systems (the elemental spirits in Colossians and Galatians) and against principalities and powers (Ephesians). In addition, there are people called control freaks, and you’re going to have to deal with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the political will to make it work. You’re going to need to</li>
</ul>
<p>make a principled decision and have the guts to stick with it. You can be sure there are going to be some people who don’t like where you are going. The naysayers will come; be willing to face them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a plan. God never did commit us to being stupid in the way</li>
</ul>
<p>we lead. You need to think strategically and plan accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have some pluck. You are going to need to be courageous. Partly</li>
</ul>
<p>because you are innovating, and also because you’re going to come up against some resistance that will threaten your sense of self among peers and members of your wider community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pray like mad. No great movement was ever birthed and sustained without white-hot faith and lots of prayer. Leaders should model this and should be a subject of prayer very often in the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust in God’s prevenience. God wants your church to be an</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>apostolic movement much more than you do. He designed us that way. Prevenience means God has prepared the way beforehand. The missional God is ahead of the curve. Look for what he is doing, make a decision to follow, and try to keep up.</p>
<p>As far as change processes are concerned, remember our chapter 1 discussion of the diffusion of innovation and the important role of innovators and early adopters. tipping point at this point, the idea is inevitable in any given population innovators early early late adopters majority majority laggards 2.5% 13.5% 34% 34% 16%</p>
<h2>Figure 34</h2>
<p>To briefly restate, all that is needed to create a tipping point is 16 percent of any given population — in this case, your church/organization. But here’s how you might process that change: The radicals represent the 16 percent. Progressives are the early majority; the conservatives, the late majority; and reactionaries are the If you want a missionlaggards. For change to take place, you have to reach the large majority of the population (the progressives al church, you have and the conservatives equal 68 percent). The change to have missional starts from the radical edge (innovators and early forms of ministry to adopters) and needs to diffuse through the system. go with it. You can’t The problem is that the radicals are just that: hotheads. They tend to be impatient with process and have one without the champ at the bit of systemic change.13 other. It’s time to take The trick is not to let the radicals try to convince Ephesians 4 much the conservatives, because the language and urgency more seriously. of the hotheads inevitably pushes the conservatives toward the more traditionalist reactionaries. The key is to get the radicals to influence the progressives, and then get the progressives to influence the conservatives. You needn’t worry about the reactionaries; they will never change anyhow. Just be aware that they can be problems, especially if they’re where significant money and power reside.</p>
<p>Remember, once you get to the tipping point, change is inevitable, but you don’t want a split.</p>
<p>One key task of leadership is to manage influence wisely. So be subversively wise about getting Xradical to talk with Yprogressive, and Yprogressive to talk with Zconservative. I dentify each group, put names to the key people who compose them (in other words, categorize influencers in your organization), place them somewhere on the scale (hot progressive and cool progressive, and so on), and manage the process. So it will look something like figure 35.</p>
