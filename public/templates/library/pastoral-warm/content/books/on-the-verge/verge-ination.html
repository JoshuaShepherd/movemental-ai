<p>It's easy to come up with new ideas; the hard part is letting go of the ones that worked for you two years ago, but will soon be out of date.</p>
<p>—ROGER VON OECH</p>

<p>Gordon McKenzie, who did much to foster the art of creative disruption at Hallmark, tells stories of going into classrooms full of kids at different levels. He would ask, “How many artists are there in the room? Would you please raise your hands?” He reports that the response was always the same: all first-grade kids considered themselves artists, in second grade about half of the kids put their hands up, in third grade about 30 percent of the kids identified themselves as artists, and so on.</p>
<p>By the time he reached sixth-grade classes, no more than one or two put their hands up — and even then rather guardedly, fearing rejection by the other kids for identifying themselves as artists.</p>
<p>The point he makes with this is that schools participate in the suppression of creative genius, and that something akin to this is at work in all organizations that suppress creativity in the cause of protecting the status quo.1 The loss of creative imagination is a direct result of trying to preserve the status quo in any organization, including the church.</p>
<p>The result of this suppression of the artful imagination is that churches and Christian organizations find themselves “stuck in a moment” (as Bono sings in the U2 song), and they struggle to break free from the limitations inherent in their current way of thinking.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, paradigms can effectively become psychic prisons we need to break out of. I really believe that our long-term captivity to the Christendom (or institutional) paradigm is directly related to our loss of the original, and originative, imagination that fueled the early church and all other exponential movements since. And I equally believe that the original apostolic (or missional) imagination of the church is the key to breaking out. As we shall see later, this is coded into Apostolic Genius, and it is latent in the church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Got You Here Won’t Get You There</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the institutional paradigm (or systems story) of the church resolves some dilemmas in preserving the faith, by encoding it (in rituals, theological traditions, ecclesial templates, and so on). However, in doing so, it creates a whole new set of problems it cannot resolve from within its own frame of reference.</p>
<p>In other words, while on the one hand the prevailing paradigm has provided the church in the West with a viable framework for understanding our nature and function for many centuries, it can no longer function as a suitable map for the new, post-Christian, increasingly unchurched, missionary context we are now having to negotiate. Furthermore, in trapping our imagination, screening our thinking, and prohibiting certain approaches, it has also blinded us to other, more productive and missionally dynamic possibilities inherent in the apostolic movement paradigm of church.</p>
<p>It's time to suggest ways we can change the paradigm by reconceiving the primary frameworks, conversations, and metaphors of how we see ourselves as God's people. We are now ready to explore how these help us transition from a more institutional paradigm closer to that of an apostolic movement. Figure 8 is an elaboration of figure 5  of the preceding chapter.</p>
<p>prevailing body of knowledge about church (inherited knowledge as source of root paradigm) contributes is informed to by myths/codes background assumptions, scripting, organizational paradigm and underlying belief system generated in organization metaphors shorthand descriptions of underlying belief system models strategies or ideas in action is impacted changes the by environment internal and external organizational reality (particular settings, conditions, and context) Figure 8 Church as Paradigm. Adapted from Hasan Sisek and Karen Louis, "Organizational Change as Paradigm Shift," Journal of Higher Education 65, no. 6 (November – December 1994).</p>
<h2>Myths/Codes</h2>
<p>Remember, organizational myths (what can also be called codes or scripts) are the background assumptions which are generally the abstract and subconscious dimension of organizational paradigm.</p>
<p>Often they come with the territory: the inherited beliefs that are simply taken for granted because they are seldom subjected to serious questioning. These beliefs and codes take on the character of myth because they are so deep-seated and resistant to change. It’s only when serious anomalies call into question the viability of the paradigm that we begin to become consciously aware of them. Actually, this is part of the function of prophetic ministry and why it’s so important. Through prophetic dissent — or through the increasing awareness of anomalies — a crisis occurs, where the organization’s viability is called into question.</p>
<p>We have to recode the organizational paradigm in order to survive.</p>
<p>Recoding is a tricky but essential matter to negotiate, because survivability and effectiveness is often at stake.2 But it can also be a very creative time as people go on an adventurous search for workable new alternatives. In our time, the major shift to a genuinely post-Christian, unchurched culture has forced the church in the West to seriously rethink our paradigm (remember the 60:40 issue). What an opportunity!</p>
<p>Remember, the answers to the crisis won’t come from within the current thinking. We have to both transcend and include our surroundings in order to go on a search for new answers. Key leadership must initiate and guide this journey, first by getting other leaders in touch with this sense of disorientation, anomaly, and crisis. Second, leaders should try to resolve the problems without recourse to the prevailing thinking, with its overused repertoire of solutions.</p>
<p>Following are some examples of deeply entrenched myths I believe are part of the institutional paradigm. Try these out on your team.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build it and they will come. This has been a predominant myth over the last fifty years but has deep roots in Christendom thinking. This one lies at the root of what I have called the attractional-extractional church. It has worked for many years, but changing conditions in our context are seriously challenging its viability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The church is the bastion of family values. This might express itself positively, as in "ours is a family church." Well, of course it is, but surely the church Jesus built should also be more than that. Furthermore, when interpreted from within the predominantly Western experience of (and assumptions about) the middle-class nuclear family, it can seriously limit — perhaps even damage — our understanding of the mission of the church.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The church is the guardian of society's morals. Again this seems hard to disagree with, but it really does come from the Christendom assumption that we're the central religious institution of society, that we have the inherent right to speak with authority into the moral situation. In a post-Christendom, post-church, secular culture, the church no longer has that kind of status, legitimacy, and permission. (Shouting louder ain't going to help!) Besides, every believer a church planter. Every church a church-planting church. This kind of myth can tend to make Pharisees of us all. Rather than trying to resolve this, we must return to the image of witness and not presume we have the cultural right to correct other people's morals.4 We point to Jesus through faithful witness, not prescribed behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need clergy, buildings, and Sunday services in order to be a real church. Again we can see the predominantly institutional paradigm impressing itself on our imaginations here. But this myth cannot explain the very best, and most impactful, Christian movements in history — which are often persecuted (therefore underground and without buildings) and are patently not run by seminary-trained professionals. Yet the myth persists even in contemporary churches; for example, we say that it is "pastor so-and-so's church" and that we "go to church" (meaning the building). Ask most people in the church what ministry is, and they will say it's something that the clergy do. If the people have anything at all to do with it, it's seen as volunteering for something and it's temporary. This myth is very deeply embedded into our codes, and we have to deliberately recode it before we can advance to becoming an apostolic movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are a Bible-teaching church. The subtext here is that if we simply teach more Bible (and teach it better), things will automatically change. The reality is that this is far from the truth. The Western church has more theology, commentaries, training, and intellectual tradition than at any other time in history, and it certainly hasn't produced the desired revival — perhaps it has even influenced the opposite! This is not to say we ought to be biblically illiterate, but we must remember we are perfectly designed to produce what we are currently producing. I'm sorry to say this, but more beautifully delivered three-point sermons are not going to solve your missional problems — or any serious strategic problems, for that matter! If they could do that, we would be there now. Remember, the Pharisees knew their Scriptures better than anyone and missed the whole point of God in Jesus (Matt. 23:24; John 5:39 – 40).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because conventional thinking serves very often to protect us from the painful job of thinking for ourselves, ruthless honesty is needed when exploring our myths and assumptions about the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of us have bought deeply into the paradigm and have even gotten our sense of legitimacy from it, so we are personally involved; we might well find ourselves getting defensive here.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s very hard to critique the seminary from which one earned one’s degree without devaluing one’s hard-earned sense of self-worth derived from the degree. This is what makes myths so hard to change.</p>
<p>We all know the story of the emperor who had no clothes. It takes a child to expose the collective spell myths have over us. So we too will need to approach this as a little child (Matt. 18:1 – 4). We need to be willing to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever the Spirit will lead us, and laugh at our own nakedness. If you are too protective of your own assumptions and myths, you will learn nothing. Some questions to ask: What myths have guided us thus far? What anomalies have led us to question their viability? How do these myths aid or hinder our effectiveness in becoming an apostolic movement?</p>
<p>I have focused on exposing examples of more negative myths here because these are the ones obstructing the latent potential Jesus has placed in every church. Many assumptions held about church are good and consistent with Verge church thinking, but again this highlights the need to take a myth audit. Take the bad assumptions out, and the good ones will do what they are meant to do: make us a whole lot better.</p>
<h2>Metaphors</h2>
<p>Metaphors, on the other hand, are powerful, highly compact language bites that give us insight into the implicit (and hidden) assumptions of any organizational paradigm. They are therefore wonderfully convenient shorthand descriptions of your belief system or myth, but they can’t provide the whole picture, only a window into aspects of it.</p>
<p>Rob Wegner reminded me at this point that Jesus always used images and metaphors, and the reason why is that stories, metaphors, and images don't have less truth than abstract propositions; they have more truth. A great story or metaphor invites you to come in. You almost intuitively find yourself in it, and it has a subversive life of its own. Metaphors and stories not only speak to the mind; they capture the heart, mind, and will all at once. The reason why metaphors are powerful descriptors is that they filter and define reality in a simple fashion (for example, "Richard is a lion," "the brain is a computer," or "organizations are machines").</p>
<p>Even simple words like amoeba, beehive, fort, and cookie cutter provide clues as to how people see and experience paradigms in relationship to organizations. For instance, if I said that such-and-such church was an elephant, what images come to mind? What if I had used the term starfish? Each metaphor will convey different information about reproductive capacities, mobility, strength, wisdom, personality, courage, and so on. Identifying the metaphors thus offers significant clues about where to focus the efforts at shifting the paradigm. And what is more, change the metaphor, and you change the imagination. Advertising (and education, for that matter) tries to do this all the time.</p>
<p>Get people to list the words and phrases that for them most accurately describe their church or organization. The problem in church circles is the vast array of metaphors people have picked up from the Bible but don't necessarily believe. So maybe you want to ask people to use the biblical metaphors they think most accurately fit, and then ask them to use nonbiblical language. Try identifying the ones people are most emotively bonded to.</p>
<p>Do this individually (and then also corporately) with samplings from all over the organization. Collate the information and identify the dominant metaphors. You might also want to ask people to add adjectives to describe the metaphor (for example, efficient, sloppy, controlling, decentralized). By the way, Clotaire Rapaille’s book The Culture Code is a brilliant resource in helping understand the codes of behavior in organizations and culture.5 In the “Shift” section following this, I will suggest many alternative metaphors more consistent with Verge church thinking.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Models (the recognizable collection of typical organizational protocols, strategies, and policies) are directly drawn from the dominant myths/codes and guide the action in any organization, including churches. Models therefore provide the scaffolding any organization needs to fulfill its function. And make no mistake, how a model is framed and played out directly shapes behaviors and actions in the organization.</p>
<p>The model activates, embeds, and maintains the paradigm and therefore needs reimagining if we are to transition to becoming a Verge church. Because we will deal thoroughly with this later, we will simply note this here since it’s part of the paradigm that needs to be assessed.</p>
<h2>A Whole New Mind</h2>
<p>Imagination and intuition are clearly functions of the right brain.</p>
<p>So in many ways we are suggesting that in order to develop Verge church thinking, we need to at least counterbalance our overreliance on methodology, ideology, and techniques, with a recovery of intelligent imagination and intuitive responsiveness. I find Daniel Pink’s A Whole New Mind very useful at this point.8 He suggests we need to cultivate a much more right-brained approach in ourselves as well as in the organizations we lead.</p>
<p>Cultivating this right-brained approach involves the following:</p>
<h3>A Quick Checklist of Reimagining Skills</h3>
<p>Much of this material will resonate with the sections that follow: "Shift" (processing change from inside out and outside in), "Innovate" (implementation of imaginative solutions to old problems), and "Move" (generating momentum and creating movement — that is, movementum). But I couldn't resist putting in some great ways to provoke imagination.6</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create holy dissatisfaction. Reach into your deepest commitments to the King and his kingdom and ask people if we have yet reached perfection. Most likely, the answer is no, with the understanding that we as God's people are called to do something about that. We are created for good works, after all (Eph. 2:10), and I guess we can always improve on the delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L = P + Q. This is the formula for learning organizations. Learning (L) takes place when programming (P) is subjected to questioning (Q). Learn how to ask the right questions and to initiate a genuine quest for the answers. For instance, you might simply ask what it is you're measuring. And then ask if what and how you are measuring are clues to what you value. Finally, ask how effectiveness could be measured differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take more risks. This is a major issue in churches that have largely become socially conservative and profoundly risk-averse. Conformity is the result of obsession with safety; diversity and adventure will come from a willingness to take risks. Simply putting yourself out of your comfort zone is likely to create new learning opportunities.7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think like a beginner, not an expert. This is a classic way to think differently about things. As the expert of your sphere, you have ready answers that suggest themselves to you. Approach the problem as a beginner, and you have to learn again from scratch. Ask, if I had to do this all again, and differently, how would I do this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell the problem before you sell the solution. Help people get in touch with the problem. Once they see (and especially feel) the issue, they can get very creative indeed. All people can be highly imaginative and innovative when their life depends on it!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This mention of feeling things differently opens up a whole new issue for us to consider.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using beauty: aesthetics. We must develop ways of thinking that factor artistic and emotional beauty into the equation. Pink calls this "design," and it means we must move beyond looking at the church in a merely functional way to looking at it as something beautiful and emotionally engaging. We've tended to see the church in far too mechanistic ways in the twentieth century, and therefore most expressions of evangelical church are pretty artless. (If you don't agree with us, then just ask any artist.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living out of a big story: narrative. The ability to use story to engender movement and open-endedness is key. This is what Pink simply calls "story," and it is vital in weaving people and organizations together. We recognize that at the heart of any healthy understanding of the church lies a compelling narrative that goes beyond a simple line of reasoning. It invites others to join and take a role in the unfolding narrative. Again this is precisely what the gospel does to us. For too long, Western Christianity has emphasized thoroughly rationalized doctrinal formulas over narrative and diminished the power of story to form Christian identity and create movement. An apostle is a theological storyteller, and apostolic movements understand and skillfully navigate the power of stories. We suggest that the recovery of story which has taken place over the last twenty or so years is at least one of the factors opening us up to see the paradigm church as an apostolic movement now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing pretty patterns: discernment. We have to improve our</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ability to detect patterns and take advantage of new opportunities presenting themselves. According to Pink, the greatest demand today isn’t detailed analysis but rather big-picture thinking, systemic approaches, nonlinear dynamics, and synthesis. He poetically calls this “symphony,” and it involves (among other things) the ability to put together seemingly disparate pieces of information, to see relationships between seemingly unrelated fields, to detect broad patterns rather than deliver specific answers, and to invent something new by combining elements no one else thinks to pair.9 In fact, we think this is exactly what is required for us to “see” as well as experience the power of Verge church ecclesiology. (In this book, this symphonic understanding of the church is what we call Apostolic Genius.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Feeling all right: empathy. This word empathy is what Pink</li>
</ol>
<p>uses to describe a capacity to understand others and forge significant relationships; others have called this emotional intelligence quotient (or EQ). Empathy involves the ability to motivate and inspire from deep within a rich relational bond, and it shouldn’t be strange for us as we seek to develop real community, or communitas, in churches. Empathy also creates a deep human bond between those related in such a way.</p>
<p>Again, this gets us much closer to what the Bible means by inspirational leadership: “Both leaders and followers raise each other to higher levels of motivation and morality by engaging each other on the basis of shared values, calling and identity.</p>
<p>They are in a relationship in which each influences the other to pursue common objectives, with the aim of inspiring followers to becoming leaders in their own right.”10 Movements thrive on — and are held together by — such relationships!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Learning to play: chillax. The ability to simply chill out and</li>
</ol>
<p>enjoy life must sometimes be learned. Pink’s advice here is very useful to evangelicals, who can tend to be somewhat task-focused, life-denying, and sometimes just plain uptight.</p>
<p>Learn to play! Seriousness has its place, but everyone needs some lightheartedness and time to have fun. This not only creates good connections but also allows space for creativity and freedom of expression within the broad guidelines of apostolic theology and ministry. God is good, and pleasure (when rightly ordered in relation to God) is a great motivator.11 Take time to enjoy his goodness together. Einstein said, “Games [playfulness] are the most elevated forms of investigation.” Play is one of the major sources of innovation.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Managing meaning: heart connection. Meaning, the final element of Pink's Whole New Mind, is clearly something we as God's people should well understand. People act from their deepest (and highest) motivations only when something is meaningful to them. Connecting people and a grander meaning lies at the heart of all ministry and mission. In Verge churches, we must motivate people through what has sometimes been called the “management of meaning.” Meaning might well require ideology but reaches beyond the mind to the heart and makes the connection between God and people.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the reason why movements hold together and how leadership can operate in and through distributed networks.</p>
<p>And it also highlights why good theology is a vital part of the equation — it makes the connection between Word and world, between God’s mind (and actions) and the human heart.</p>
<p>All this requires us to seriously reconsider the role of the Holy Spirit in organization, mission, and ministry. Clearly, the Spirit brings life, creativity, and inspirational courage to his people while at the same time requiring intuition, risk, responsiveness, and flexibility from us.</p>
<p>If we want to move to the Verge and become an apostolic movement again, we must allow God’s Spirit to play a leading role. We simply have to ask ourselves hard questions about the extent to which we have replaced the leading of the Spirit with technique, ideology, and topheavy, left-brained thinking in the life of the church. Movements are movements of the Spirit of God before they are anything else.</p>
<p>So what’s not to like about right-brained thinking? Particularly when we see this as a corrective (and not as an overbalance) to the other side — we could do with a whole lot more intuition/imagination and a little less rationality and technique. This does, however, raise significant and very practical issues for us. Like all paradigm shifts, it will likely also require repentance from us if we are to progress healthily into the Verge church paradigm.</p>
<p>First, it’s obvious that left-brained approaches will tend to yield left-brained results, and vice versa. Clearly, we need both. However, at present, most leadership is overwhelmingly male, even though most ministry on the ground is performed by women. Remember, we are perfectly designed to achieve what we are currently achieving, in that our organizations tend to reflect a predominance of male thinking (which tends to be more left-brained and can tend to exclude right-brained thinking). The results are the loss of creativity, diminished relationships, and a whole lot less by way of symphony. Let’s be honest: women tend to be better at this than men, and in order to be genuinely movemental, we need a whole lot more women in leadership. It’s time to balance up this equation.</p>
<p>At the risk of overgeneralizing, what Pink is describing with this right-brained approach can be characterized as being much more “feminine” in style and approach to organization and leadership.</p>
<p>Movements need "masculine" technique and structure, certainly, but they also require us to be more fluid, responsive, and intuitive in order to develop — especially when we need creative solutions in order to thrive/survive. In other words, we need a balance of masculine and feminine energy in the church, radiating from leadership out. It's no coincidence that about 65 percent of the leaders in the Chinese underground church are women, and even more in the many rapidly expanding movements in India and elsewhere. The same is true for the post–New Testament church; women played a very significant and active role in the expansion of early Christianity.12 And consider that of the fifty thousand cell churches within Yoido Full Gospel Church, the world-influencing church led by the apostolic leader Dr. Yonggi Cho, over forty thousand are pastored (yes, pastored) by women — which indicates a massive change of thinking from Dr. Cho's early days.</p>
<p>It's not so much that the church has a mission but that the mission has a church. Church follows mission, not the other way around.</p>
<p>No matter how we choose to interpret the Pauline texts (and for what it is worth, both Dave and I are fuzzy complementarians), it’s clear in the New Testament and from history that women bear together with men the image of God, are integrally part of the body of Christ, are fully empowered agents of the King, and are commissioned in their conversion to Jesus’ ministry and kingdom. It’s high time to balance out the male dominance in church ministry and leadership.</p>
<p>If we do not, we can expect more of the same (somewhat one-brained) results we're currently achieving.13 Second, few churches and Christian organizations make space for serious experimentation, research, and development — space now known in the business world as "skunkworks" projects. Not only does this lack of space diminish our capacity to dream up new futures and solve significant problems; it will inevitably mean that we'll lack creative options precisely when we need them, because we haven't valued and invested in creativity. In times of uncertainty and adaptive challenges, this can prove completely disastrous. The best way to have one great idea is to have many ideas; the best way to negotiate the conditions of rapid, discontinuous change isn't to have one ten-year plan but to have many one-to three-year plans.14 Best thinking and practices in the business world reflect this — they have to. Failure to innovate means inevitable demise in a global economy. The missional situation we face demands that we have more creative irons in the fire and that we invest in research and development (R&#x26;D); this means embracing the right-brained approach more often.</p>
<p>The movement itself is its own R&#x26;D department.</p>
<p>Truth is that most of the R&#x26;D and skunkworks projects for churches would cost nothing (or very little indeed). For instance, Rob Wegner notes, "Every church has loads of people who are just itching to do this, as well as people who would personally fund it. All these folks just need encouragement, permission, training, and coaching along the way. Ask five people who are interested to read The Forgotten Ways Handbook together or The Tangible Kingdom Primer by Hugh Halter and Matt Smay, and over six months encourage them to go and do it where God has already planted them. Then make sure you harvest the ideas and learnings that flow out of their experiences... it's that simple." Alex McManus, a colleague in Future Travelers and a missional architect for Kensington Community Church, adds that tapping into the initiatives of adventurous missional leaders will coax churches and their leaders out from within the four walls and into the world, where God is waiting for them.</p>
<h2>Changing the Conversation</h2>
<p>As a Word community, the church fully understands the power of words; they shape reality. Theology itself is built on this very idea.</p>
<p>In general, words mediate by signifying or triggering appropriate thoughts in our minds. Like the imagination to which they appeal, they make or imply associations and therefore shape the way we perceive reality. In many ways, we can say that words even define reality; change people’s language, and you will in the end change their way of thinking. The whole study of linguistics and semiotics has made a science of this, and the power of it (for good and evil) is undeniable. As we’ve seen, imagination uses metaphor, words, and images to probe possibility, solve problems, project into the future, look around corners, and (in the end) evoke action. So too Verge churches must recover this capacity to develop powerful words and phrases that help people think and act differently. In fact, it’s our hope that this book is a virtual cache of missional slogans to help fire up apostolic movement.</p>
<h2>The Power of a Slogan</h2>
<p>“The slogan is... probably the best people mover this side of earthquakes, court orders and guns.”15 This is because a slogan is as easy to remember as it is hard to forget and plants itself in the consciousness by rhythm, rhyme, pith, or brevity. Once there, it works not only by whatever imagery it carries but also by the latent emotions it mobilizes, either calming or inflaming an audience — depending on purpose. As such, “the slogan lurks as a sort of floating hook in the psyche. Properly tugged, it can impel people to coalesce, to divide, to fight, to sacrifice, to vote, to buy.”16 Consider the following slogans, all of which still carry great ideas that are sticky, motivational, and viral: “Yes, we can!” recently helped propel the first African-American president into the White House.</p>
<p>Pope Urban II’s rallying cry “God wills it!” fired up the First Crusade.</p>
<p>Luther’s “Here I stand, I can do no other, so help me God” ignited the Reformation. “Speak softly and carry a big stick” evokes the now-vanished world of Theodore Roosevelt’s America. Horace Greeley’s popularization of “Go west, young man” not only helped inspire California-bound migration but even today conjures up appealing images.</p>
<p>“No taxation without representation.” “Make love, not war.” “Give me liberty or give me death.” “We shall overcome.” “Hell no, we won’t go.” Each of these captured social imagination, focused emotion, and fueled various people-movements.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of a theologically loaded slogan to ignite apostolic movement. Consider, for instance, the theological force gathered up and communicated in the apostolic church's timeless rallying call "Jesus is Lord!" — not only is this a whole worldview (Christocentric monotheism) in three words, but it is a thoroughly sneezable slogan that has galvanized countless viral movements in history. The sheer movemental power of “Every believer a church planter, every church a church-planting church” is quite remarkable. Viewed in the light of the power of words to shape and transform behavior, thinking, and culture, the gospel itself is the most powerful idea-virus in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Here are some slogans from Future Travelers churches: Granger Community Church: Blowing it up to blow it out.</p>
<p>Community Christian Church: Helping people find their way back to God.</p>
<p>The Journey: We are a community on mission, not a mission of community.</p>
<p>Soma Communities: We don’t go to church, we are the church.</p>
<p>River Tree Christian Church: Your mission is your life.</p>
<h2>Making It Schtick</h2>
<p>But generating great slogans isn't always easy. We need to make them as sticky as Velcro and as contagious as viruses. Sadly, we should expect the automatic rejection of the obvious, without thought, inspection, or experiment, in all forms of human endeavor, perhaps especially in church circles.17 In their stimulating book Made to Stick, the Heath brothers suggest some principles in order to "sell ideas" and to be able to develop what they call "stickiness."18 It is therefore important for innovative missional leaders to remember that developing the best evidence and practices is often even less than half the battle. Ideas that spread and stick need to be sold well too.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reader can easily discern the direct use of, and appeal to, the imagination and right-brained thinking throughout these six principles. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity. “To strip an idea down to its core, we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short isn’t the mission — sound bites aren’t the ideal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Proverbs are the ideal. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound.”19</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Surprise. “We can use surprise — an emotion whose function is to increase alertness and cause focus — to grab people’s attention.... For our idea to endure, we must generate interest and curiosity.”20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concreteness. "We must explain our ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information.... In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: 'A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.' "21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credibility. “Sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves....” Ronald Reagan asked, “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago.”22</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Emotions. “How do we get people to care about our ideas? We</li>
</ol>
<p>make them feel something.... We are wired to feel things for people, not for abstractions. Sometimes the hard part is finding the right emotion to harness.”23</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Stories. “How do we get people to act on our ideas? We tell</li>
</ol>
<p>stories.... Hearing stories acts as a kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively.”24</p>
<h2>A Tithe to the Lord</h2>
<p>Having made all these statements about intuition and insight, I'd like to offer an intuition of my own here (and Dave thoroughly agrees with this as well): Taking a cue from one of the slogans, that every church has in it all that it needs to get the job done, I suggest that there are many people present in your church who already intuitively understand Verge church thinking. For some it might be a vague sense of holy discomfort with the status quo, for others it is already a well-informed grasp of the dynamics of people-movements, but these intuitive thoughts are still seeking expression. I dare suggest there may be as many as 10 percent in any progressive contemporary church who will already have a positive heart-response to the various issues we raise in this book, even if they might not be able to fully articulate their thoughts yet. You can work with this; massive movements were started with far less — our New Testament church ancestors being a case in point! Movements, like human bodies, start small. We start as single-cell organisms — and if all the conditions are right, we can grow very, very big indeed!</p>
<p>This suggestion of 10 percent buy-in — a missional "people tithe," so to speak — is an intuitive guess, but it does square well with Everett Rogers' theory called Diffusion of Innovation, which states that in any given population there are a range of people with different responses to new ideas, including the progressive wing composed of innovators and early adopters (fig. 9). It's a leader's job to understand that these people are present and are vital in changing the organization, and indeed for innovation itself. The same theory of knowledge would suggest that all you need is 16 percent of the most progressive sectors of a population for the idea to be inevitable in that system!25 Gladwell's Tipping Point simply confirms Rogers' basic thesis and develops it.</p>
<pre><code>tipping point
at this point, the idea is inevitable in any given population

innovators    early adopters    early majority    late majority    laggards
   2.5%           13.5%             34%               34%            16%
</code></pre>
<h2>Figure 9</h2>
<p>This is a well-tested theory, and it ought to be used to further apostolic movement. It’s surely a strategic task of leadership to identify these people (the “berry-eaters,” who are first to try the new fruits at risk of their own lives), legitimize their concerns, fertilize their thinking, give them oodles of permission to dream, and then harvest the results. In other words, create a homegrown think tank and use this as a generative source of imagination, leadership, and ideas.</p>
<p>From Here to There, Funny Things Are Everywhere</p>
<p>A final word about transitioning to the new paradigm: it's not going to feel comfortable at first. It's just not. (Deal with it.) We are so used to operating in the existing paradigm that it feels natural to us, and it will be the new that feels rather strange and unnatural. It might just feel... eccentric, but I suggest that all new ideas feel that way at first. What is now accepted as normal once felt abnormal and eccentric. Verge churches are just that: on the verge. And because their primary paradigm is deeply grounded in inherited institutional ideas of church, a more movemental approach isn't necessarily going to feel easy, at least at first. Abraham Maslow's scale of learning might be as useful here as it is later, in the final section, "Move," where we talk about movementum and change management. You see, Maslow maintained that in relation to awareness and embracing of any idea, action, or paradigm, people will move through four distinct stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unconscious incompetence. Here people are simply not aware of</li>
</ol>
<p>the new paradigm at all. Clearly, the task is to raise awareness so learning can begin. Apart from selling the problem before suggesting the solution, leadership should appeal mainly to the latent imagination and sense of obligation to God’s mission that all true believers feel.26 It’s good to remind ourselves at this point that in order to change our perception, we have to first experience some level of frustration in our actions, or a significant change of purpose.27 Holy discontent accompanied by an imaginative search for answers will move people toward...</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Conscious incompetence. Here there is a dawning awareness</li>
</ol>
<p>about the Verge paradigm, and — as a result — people become increasingly aware of their individual and corporate deficiencies in this area. The trick is not to get cynical or give up.</p>
<p>What is needed at this point is a real commitment to learn and grow, to try things out, and so move to the next stage. To increase the levels of competence and confirm the truth of the paradigm, leaders should directly model the change they wish to see and should encourage lots of experimentation, with plenty of permission to fail. Help the church get over its risk averseness and get to...</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Conscious competence. This phase happens when people understand the basic dynamics of the new paradigm but still need to concentrate in order to operate well; it is not yet second nature or automatic. Like a new driver, navigating the road takes concentration and practice, but the natural reflexes will come. The slogan “Practice makes perfect” might well apply here, until the final phase comes...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unconscious competence. Here the paradigm becomes instinctual — it’s hard to see it any other way. Those at this stage are true insiders of the paradigm. They are now competent to teach others about apostolic movement thinking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Leaders will need to help others adopt innovation, by providing broad-based access to knowledge, by actively persuading people about the viability of the new paradigm, and by encouraging others to give it a go (not just once but a few times, because it’s going to feel clunky at first). Eventually the innovation will be fully embraced.</p>
<p>Dream On...</p>
<p>Peter Drucker once stated, "People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete — the things that should have worked but didn't, the things that once were productive and no longer are."28 The task of visionary leaders, therefore, is not only to make sure things advance into some preferred future but also to ensure that outmoded ideas and processes are discarded along the way. This is partly what a mission to the mind is all about. It's relatively easy to come up with new ideas; the really hard part is letting go of what worked two (or four or eight) years ago but will soon be out-of-date! We need to unlearn as much as we need to learn. We need to be remissionalized at a very deep level. And to do this, we need imagination, but even more so we need apostolic imagination.</p>
<p>I end this chapter where I started, with a reminder that the first task of leadership is to define reality. As Christian leaders, this reality isn’t something we arbitrarily determine; rather it’s based on a biblical view of things. It’s critical that leadership, at every level, come to grips with the profoundly biblical nature of Verge church thinking. The previous chapter suggested four Verge focal points, or paradigms, that are needed to reimagine the nature of church and mission as apostolic movement (Christology, missiology, organization, and discipleship).</p>
<p>With this as a guide, we can begin to move away from the prevailing imagination/paradigm of church, one that has served the gospel for centuries but now blinds us to more dynamic forms of church.</p>
<p>Your primary responsibility as a leader will be to awaken what is already there, by calling people to see beyond their current constraints, to wake up to the ever-present reality of Jesus, and to fulfill their deeper destinies as disciples of the King. You will need courage and conviction to do this. But know this: when awakening the deeply embedded missionary calling and instincts of the church, you have the Holy Spirit on your side. This is what apostolic ministry is about, and (dare I say) what it means to be a true apostolic visionary in our day.</p>
<h2>Dave's Response to "Mission to the Mind and Heart"</h2>
<p>The challenge to recapture the missional imagination of God's people in the West may be more daunting than we first thought, because there is not only a crisis of creativity in the church; there is also a crisis of creativity in the United States. Gordon McKenzie's hunch about the loss of imaginative creativity, which he tested by asking first- through sixth-graders, "Who is an artist?" is now substantiated. After analyzing almost three hundred thousand creativity scores from adults and children over the last fifty years, Kyung Hee Kim at the College of William &#x26; Mary found that creativity scores have consistently declined for the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Kim commented, “It’s very clear, and the decrease is very significant.” So creativity is not only a great challenge for the church; it’s also a challenge for the context of the church. The battle for the future of the Western church will be won or lost in the minds of people. We must recapture the imagination of God’s people with his compelling vision of transformed lives and communities, or we’ll die a slow death, trapped in the same paradigm as our brothers and sisters in Australia and Europe.</p>
<p>The response to this challenge by churches that are part of the Future Travelers has been swift and definitive in at least three ways: challenging existing assumptions, creating new metaphors, and exploring new models. Let me give you some examples of each.</p>
<h3>Challenging Existing Assumptions</h3>
<p>The Austin Stone Church in Austin, Texas, was born out of a Southern Baptist tradition and, because of this, inherited denominational assumptions about baptism. The assumption was that if you wanted to be baptized, you had to come to a church-sponsored ser vice and have an elder or pastor baptize you. This is a perfect example of the kind of unwritten code that supports an institutional paradigm of church that creates a chasm between the clergy and laity. It’s my view that baptism was given to us not just for the benefit of the person being baptized but also for the baptizer. It’s like payday after doing the work of an evangelist. Think of all the people who have prayed for a friend or neighbor and spent hours talking to them and finally introducing them to Jesus, only to have some “professional” step in and do the baptizing. How de-motivating! I know it isn’t about gaining personal reward, but neither should the reward be going to some pastor who never met the person.</p>
<p>At the Austin Stone Church, they began to reimagine the experience of baptism as they reread the Great Commission: “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matt. 28:19 – 20). One staff member confessed, “We realized we were letting them go and teach, but when it came to baptism, we were saying, ‘Bring them to us to be baptized.’ We were only asking them to follow two-thirds of the Great Commission.” So the unwritten code saying that only elders and pastors could baptize (and it had to be done in church) had to go away. Today Austin Stone is baptizing more people than ever, and they have people in their communities baptizing in their pools, hot tubs, lakes — wherever there is water! This particular unwritten code is just one of the many assumptions that must be challenged if we are to see a paradigm shift in the churches we lead. Making that shift will require courageous use of our imaginations.</p>
<h2>Creating New Metaphors</h2>
<p>Granger Community Church is a sprawling megachurch in northwest Indiana. They had heard Alan say, "Change the metaphor, and you change the imagination" and knew it was true. They also knew that if you asked anyone in the Granger area about their church, they would point to the fifty-four-acre physical campus and say, "Granger is over there." The leadership knew that the primary metaphor for their church was their building and that — if they ever wanted to see an apostolic movement — they needed to create new metaphors, starting with their facility. The new metaphor had to inspire people to go and not just bring. So the leadership of Granger began to imagine new metaphors for their campus and came up with the following possibilities they are still working through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incubator: a facility nurturing new missional expressions</li>
<li>Boot camp: a facility training people for full missional engagement</li>
<li>Airport: a facility sending you to another place, not keeping you</li>
</ul>
<p>inside it</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notre Dame University (which is near Granger): a facility training alumni who spread worldwide after graduation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community center: a facility reprogrammed to provide for the</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>community and not just for the church The consistent use of any of these metaphors (and the practices that must go with them) will be a huge help in transitioning Granger from an exclusively attractional paradigm to a gathered and scattered church.</p>
<p>The hard work of identifying current metaphors and reimagining new ones is critical for creating a new systems story for any church.</p>
<h2>Exploring New Models</h2>
<p>With more than fifteen hundred people from around St. Louis, Missouri, in community groups, the Journey church had seen tremendous success connecting people into smaller groups. While this impressive number of people had been successfully assimilated into the life of the larger church, the leaders of the church knew that most were not personally engaged in mission. The church's existing model was perfectly designed to achieve what they were currently achieving, but they wanted more! They wanted to see a missional movement throughout the St. Louis region. They began to explore other models and designed a website called Community Loop, where community group leaders could go to connect their groups with a variety of missional causes throughout the city. The reimagining process created a new model that provided ways for their small groups to stay intact and move forward on mission.</p>
<p>In a culture whose imagination is slowly slipping away, we have within us the source of all creativity, the imago Dei. We are all made in the image of our God, and that includes, among other things, the ability to be imaginatively creative. And when the church is in the act of imagining, we access the imago Dei within us and within our communities of faith. That imagination has the capacity to make visible what was only implied, to connect matter with spirit. Holy imagination is able to help us rediscover our primal story, an alternative story that has the power to move us forward into God’s future.</p>

<h3>"Shift" Section</h3>
<p>Having described the silver imagination and the mission to the mind required to become an apostolic movement, we now come to the very heart of this book. Here I will put forward a unique, distinctly movemental, model for change.</p>
<p>Nowhere, as far as we are aware, has there been offered a change process to develop churches into apostolic movements. And while the process might itself be innovative, it is developed on best practices as it relates to systemic change.</p>
<p>But a few things need explanation and definition before we can engage the shift process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Verge Paradigm to Verge Practice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this point, we have explored the nature of the paradigm, or cluster of paradigms, needed to shift toward being apostolic movements in the West. We have also looked at some ways in which we can unleash imagination and creative thinking in the life of the church or Christian organization. Here I will suggest a process that will allow churches to engage the Verge paradigm and begin to genuinely embrace apostolic movement.</p>
<p>This process assumes that all organizations, and indeed humans, work from a paradigmatic center which operates as a kind of ideological DNA. Furthermore, it assumes that this genetic basis provides the basis of values, or ethos, and that ethos in turn is what generates meaningful actions. If this is true, that the paradigm determines outcomes, then all true and lasting change must first take place at the deepest level, at the level of the genetic codes of the organization — the paradigm.</p>
<pre><code>apostolic paradigm → apostolic culture → Apostolic Genius
    (paradigm)         (values system)      (actions)
   more fixed        more fluid
</code></pre>
<h2>Figure 10</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As mentioned before, if we don't change the paradigm, then all attempts to change at the other, less causal, more expressive, elements of organization will likely fail, because the default will just reassert itself. The paradigm of the church determines everything else; ethos and praxis are expressions of the paradigm to greater or lesser degrees, more fluid and adaptive than paradigms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the intangible nature of the paradigm, and because of the power of the scripting of our codes, it is much harder to work at this level, because it requires significant theological awareness and understanding of organizations and paradigms. The work here is conceptual; we have to reframe assumptions and change imaginations (hearts and minds). Nonetheless! If this is done, and done well, we can expect cascading missional change to result, because when we do this, we are working as Christian organizations should work — from the inside out. That’s why God needs our hearts in order to get everything else. Our hearts, remember, are our paradigmatic centers.</p>
<h2>Discipling the Whole Shebang</h2>
<p>In many ways, what I am talking about here is discipleship — however, not discipleship that merely includes every believer but discipleship that also goes on to transform the whole system we call church and organization. We need another kind of administration that goes beyond organizational transformation, one that can address not just the transformation of an organization but also the transformation of the human heart. For that, there is one possibility — only one. There is a carpenter, a young rabbi, and his name is Jesus. He announced the coming of such a new organization that is a living organism made of people: the kingdom of God. You might want to call it the society of the transformed heart. And since that day two thousand years ago, governments and civilizations and political movements and economic systems come and go, they rise and they fall. But Jesus remains the single bright light of the human race for heart transformation.</p>
<p>If this is so — and it’s hard to dispute it — then we have to ask ourselves, what’s our plan to pursue both organizational and personal transformation? How does Apostolic Genius awaken in the heart of each follower of Jesus in our church?</p>
<p>Philippians 2:13 says that “it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.” The reality is that I can’t really change myself; only Jesus can; only God does heart transformation.</p>
<p>But I’m not passive either. I’m not just treading water, because verse 12 says, “My dear friends, as you have always obeyed — not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence — continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.” Paul says, “work out.” There are activities and practices to which we commit in order to be able to join God in the process. This is something we do. We must arrange our lives around certain practices that deliberately serve to awaken (and “work out”) Apostolic Genius and make it the central paradigm and ethos of our lives and church.</p>
<p>Consider Dallas Willard's work on VIM; in many ways, it offers an exact parallel to the shift process we suggest in this book (paradigm → ethos → practice).1 While referring to the transformation of the heart, Willard says we need a VIM:</p>
<ul>
<li>V stands for vision (the Jesus dream)</li>
<li>I stands for intention (the Jesus decision)</li>
<li>M stands for method (the Jesus way)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to pursue the transformation of the heart, we have to have a vision (paradigm) — a picture, a dream of what this new life would be like. And then, flowing out of that somewhere along the line, we've got to make a decision that we will pursue this; that's intention (ethos). Then it involves a method (practice) — a rearranged life, a way.</p>
<p>If we embed the Verge paradigm properly, we can expect an authentic Verge culture to emerge. As you are about to see, the shift process involves the embedding of Apostolic Genius (with its symphony of six elements of mDNA) at the heart of the organization. Next, through a profound engagement with our deepest identity as an apostolic movement, we will go on to develop a movemental ethos. And finally, out of a theologically well-funded ethos, we develop apostolic movement practices.2 Initiating and developing (discipling) movements — and even more so, reframing existing organizations as movements — is likely to require some serious change management. Dave will delve into this in the final section, called "Move." In this section, however, we will explore the central process for moving from the apostolic movement concepts to sustainable and consistent practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Putting the Apostolic Genius into Apostolic Movements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this section, we will articulate what we believe is the epicenter of Verge churches. The first chapter in this section deals with the core codes of a Verge church. I use the term Apostolic Genius, a phrase I coined in The Forgotten Ways, to describe the paradigm at the heart of apostolic movements. Apostolic Genius is the total phenomenon, but it is in turn composed of six elements, what I call mDNA. The use of genetic language here is very deliberate; as in all living organisms, genetics plays a determining role in shaping the organism as well as in reproducing it.</p>
<p>The same is true for the living system that is the human organization.</p>
<p>There are deeply embedded codes at the heart of the organization that determine identity and shape resultant behavior and actions.</p>
<p>I use the word mDNA here because it distinguishes the ecclesial genetic coding from its biological counterpart and because I believe that Apostolic Genius actually describes nothing less than the internal, transmitted genetic code of all apostolic movements in history.3 Please hear this carefully, because it's a big claim: I am saying that wherever we see an apostolic movement — the type of Christian movement that experiences an exponential growth curve, high impact, and "spontaneous expansion" — these six elements will be present and dynamically interrelating in the movement's system! It is vital for the reader to understand what is being said here, so let me say this another way: assuming God's presence and activity, where the six elements come together and begin to create and inform a Christian organization, apostolic movement appears to be inevitable!4 If you can track with this, then in Apostolic Genius we are onto nothing less than the key to bringing movements into play!</p>
<p>So having identified and briefly described the phenomenon of Apostolic Genius, now we are ready to concisely identify the six elements of mDNA that together make it flare up. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is Lord. This is the spiritual heart and theological soul of</li>
</ul>
<p>apostolic movements and will require that we take Jesus with all seriousness in every possible way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disciple-making. This is the way Jesus lives his life through us,</li>
</ul>
<p>and the way in which a missional ethos is embedded throughout the organization. Essentially, it is a process of being apprenticed to Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missional-incarnational impulse. This describes the ways in which</li>
</ul>
<p>the church follows the missional God in its engagement with the world. It will mean we take seriously the issue of how we engage culture and extend the mission of God through his people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apostolic environment. This is how the church’s ministry is</li>
</ul>
<p>expressed in at least five forms, allowing for growth and maturity. Here we will tackle the idea of developing a missional ministry and leadership for a missional church movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organic systems. This looks into the way decentralized movements are set in motion and then subsequently organized. We are going to have to look at ways in which we can reconfigure ministry to incorporate more reproductive, fluid, and adaptive forms of church and church organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communitas. This strange word describes the kind of comradely community that forms in the context of spiritual challenge, adventure, and risk. Here we deal with issues relating to esprit de corps and overcoming the risk averseness of prevailing forms of church.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Remembered Ways</h2>
<p>Another vital thing to note is that this Apostolic Genius is present but forgotten, latent but unused, in every church, and in fact, in the same way that DNA is in every cell in a body, mDNA is also present in every cell of the body of Christ. In other words, every believer carries the church’s potential for world transformation, and every church has the selfsame potential infused into its system. And before you think this is some spooky New Age idea about human potential, we suggest it has more to do with the power of the gospel and the presence of God the Holy Spirit working in and through human agency than with some idealized view of human power and ability. Yes, it is Jesus who will build his church, but make no mistake, we are real players in the kingdom equation, and God has created human beings with incredible potentials, mDNA included.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is the only possible conclusion from the study of apostolic movements, particularly demonstrated in the persecuted forms of movement.5 Like DNA, the full genetic coding laced throughout every cell of your body, every component in the church’s living system has the full capacity for the whole. To employ another useful metaphor, the church that Jesus designed is more like a starfish than an animal with a central nervous system.6 Each piece of a starfish has the full potential of a new starfish; twenty pieces lead to twenty starfish! Viewed in this perspective, there are literally thousands of (potential) starfish contained within just one of these creatures. A church of a thousand disciples has a thousand potential churches contained in itself!</p>
<p>People might argue that not everyone can do a church. But this seems to work against what we see in people-movements everywhere.</p>
<p>Very ordinary people get to be very significant agents of missional church. Actually, this is exactly what happened in the New Testament church! It is certainly on current display in China, India, and Latin America, in budding pockets of churches throughout the West, and so on.7 Our inability to see it means that our current institutional paradigm blinds us to the reality of dormant potentials in all of God's people. This is one of the things that must be overcome if we are to operate as a Verge church.8</p>
<p>This is exactly what the Verge church process seeks to do: activate the latent potentials that are already present but largely inactive within most churches. It is important to recognize this, because we are not suggesting that you import some alien system of ideas into your church; rather we suggest that we must remember what we have forgotten. In effect, we are not imposing the six elements of mDNA but rather reactivating them and establishing them at the epicenter of our thinking — at the root of where all ecclesial identity, ministry concepts, and missional actions are formed.9 Beginning with the end in mind means starting with a vision and paradigm of apostolic movement if we are to truly become an apostolic movement. We suggest that Apostolic Genius (with its six elements of mDNA) provides us with the apostolic imagination needed to become apostolic movements. And when it is recognized, understood, activated, and applied at the very base of our thinking, it will change everything; here is the paradigm shift, the genetic codes, for Verge church movement.</p>
<p>And so applying this to the Verge church process will mean embedding these six elements of mDNA at the center of identity and consciousness. It will look something like figure 11.</p>

<h2>Figure 11</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The mDNA core requires a constant return to the center to legitimize any ethos and praxis that come out of it. We will be continuously engaging all six elements at any given time. They will need to be embedded at the center of the church/organization. This means constant study of, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Other Aspects to Consider Think Systems: It’s the Whole That Counts
The six elements of mDNA provide us with a system, a way of
seeing movements in their wholeness. It is not a one-dimensional look
nomenon of movements in their wholeness — as a system of interrelat-
do is consider your own body and try to remember, from your biology
with one part, and you mess with the whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim made in The Forgotten Ways is that all six elements are evident in all Jesus movements that achieve spontaneous expansion. In other words, Verge church thinking is inherently systemic in nature, and therefore it is critical that you keep your eye on the whole while focusing on any of the singular elements. We cannot emphasize this too strongly.</p>
<p>Remember, there are no single silver bullets; however, there definitely is a silver imagination that emerges when all six elements, powerful in their own right, come together in Apostolic Genius. Never lose sight of the fact that a true apostolic movement needs all six elements to make it cook. It’s the whole, not just the parts, that counts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we would highly recommend that those who wish to pursue a Verge process use the mPULSE approach to both diagnose the organization and develop strategy using the Apostolic Genius systems approach. This tool is more thoroughly described in Alan's response to chapter 9 (p. 271), but readers can familiarize themselves with this by going to www.theforgottenways.org/mpulse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ending with the Beginning in Mind</p>
<p>If beginning with the end in mind is wise, then we should also endeavor to end with the beginning in mind. If only a good tree can bear good fruit, it is also true that only good seeds can produce a good tree. Work hard at getting it right at the beginning, because what you do then determines what you end up with later. Mutations at the genetic level of the movement (mDNA) will lead to some serious problems later on.</p>

<li>If You Love Something Long Enough</li>
</ul>
<p>If you love something long enough, it will reveal itself to you. In many ways, this is the way Alan discovered the six elements in the first place. It was a refusal to stop probing the issue of what factors come together to initiate and sustain apostolic movements. It took three years of probing the problem every day: reading, researching, interviewing, observing, theorizing, testing, discarding aspects that didn’t fit, starting over again, and so on. This is not always easy, but as we indicated in the chapter on imagination, leadership has to define what reality is for any organization, and that requires conceptual work. For many, this will feel difficult because it is so intangible and because we all suffer paradigm blindness caused by the institutional paradigm of the church. But no matter how you configure it, in the end it’s going to mean prayerful study and passionate pursuit of a greater manifestation of the kingdom than we currently experience. We need to cultivate a certain type of spiritual hunger for more. So prayerfully and passionately keep at it; you will eventually “see” it in a flash of revelation, and then you will wonder why you hadn’t seen it all along.</p>
<p>Do this with your teams and friends.</p>
<h2>Win Hearts and Minds</h2>
<p>A Verge church will need to come forth at the level of both heart (volition and imagination) and mind (rationality and theology). This is vital in initiating and maintaining any movement; minds and hearts must be constantly engaged. This will be developed robustly in the “Move” section, which is all about momentum and movement.</p>
