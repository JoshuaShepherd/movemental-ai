<h1>Afterword</h1>
<h2>BY MICHAEL FROST</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein has been credited with decreeing that everything should be
made as simple as possible, but not more so. Sadly, we live in a time when
the “more so” is too prevalent. Everything, it seems, has to be oversimplified</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The President mocks the idea of climate change on snowy days, because climate science has been abridged to some nonspecific belief about things getting warmer.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter, whose guiding principles include advocating on behalf of black victims who died at the hands of white police officers, as well as being concerned with black-on-black crime, is met with the dismissive and oversimplified “All lives matter!” Ethical questions regarding reproductive health, indigenous people’s rights, racial reconciliation or social welfare, are reduced to slogans and catchcries. People demand that we answer complex questions with a simple yes or no. Radio announcers and news commentators mock those who want to describe the complexity of something and offer multifaceted solutions to tough issues. They decry such answers as convoluted and disingenuous.</p>
<p>As Rev. Byron Williams says, “Whether it’s Black Lives Matter, trade agreements, illegal immigration, the economy or something else, we crave oversimplification for a recipe that requires nuance. We seek the simplistic answer when only the difficult response will suffice.”1 That’s because life is complex. It is richly, beautifully, magnificently baffling at times. All the most splendid things in this world—coral reefs, child-raising, social justice, the raging sea, reconciliation, staying married, Antarctica, South Australian cabernet, extended family meals, a sensational cup of coffee—these things are not simple to describe, nor to sustain.</p>
<p>The dumbing down of our society is crushing the life out of us, flattening everything into two dimensions, dicing it all into bite-sized pieces.</p>
<p>And the church is just as guilty of this reductionism. We want to shrinkwrap our truth claims too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, the big, wide, expansive understanding of the reign of God that
Christ taught us has been reduced to merely information about how to go
to heaven when you die. The mission of God’s people is downgraded to an
is condensed into discussions about style and venue, as if all there is to
and tattoos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Walter Brueggemann says, “The gospel is […] a truth widely held, but a truth greatly reduced. It is a truth that has been flattened, trivialized, and rendered inane. Partly, the gospel is simply an old habit among us, neither valued nor questioned. But more than that, our technical way of thinking reduces mystery to problem, transforms assurance into certitude, quality into quantity, and so takes the categories of biblical faith and represents them in manageable shapes.”2 We want to take a truth that’s as big as an ox and turn it into a bouillon cube. We want to talk before we listen; argue before we converse; assume before we know; reject before we honor.</p>
<p>This is what Alan discovered at Burning Man, and Mark was confronted by while walking the Camino.</p>
<p>That’s why a book like Reframation is so refreshing. It throws open all the doors and flings open every window on the gospel, to broaden our vision and deepen our responsibility as God’s people. It is invigorating to have truth reframed this way. Perhaps as you read it, you felt a frisson of recognition. Like me, maybe Alan and Mark spoke to your yearning for something richer in your faith than mere Sunday attendance and plastic nativity scenes and the latest outreach program? I believe they have opened our eyes to the stunning, complicated, beautiful truth of Christ.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the great G. K. Chesterton once contrasted how Christian saints are depicted in art as opposed to Buddhist saints: perhaps the shortest statement of it is that the Buddhist saint always has his eyes shut, while the Christian saint always has them wide open. The Buddhist saint has a sleek and harmonious body, but his eyes are heavy and sealed with sleep. The medieval saint’s body is wasted to its crazy bones, but his eyes are frightfully alive […] The Buddhist is looking with a peculiar intentness inwards. The Christian is staring with frantic intentness outwards.3 Not so these days. As I’ve mentioned, we seem to prefer our eyes closed to complexity. That is until a book like this one shakes us from our slumber and demands we look again. And having seen it, we cannot look away. We cannot un-see what has been revealed to us.</p>
<p>Afterword 191 And so, it falls to me in this afterword to state the obvious—that the burden of responsibility now falls on you. Alan and Mark have discharged theirs. Those of us who have heard and seen, whose doors have been blown from their hinges, whose windows have been shattered, who now see as they hadn’t seen before, we are charged with the duty to act on what we now know.</p>
<p>Alan and Mark began this book by saying that they held a deep conviction “that there is a great need for a reframation that allows us to see God, people, and mission through re/enchanted frames.” Now, as you close the pages of this book, you are left with the incredible commission to tell and live the full story of God in your town or village or suburb or on the Camino or at Burning Man or wherever God may send you in this world.</p>
