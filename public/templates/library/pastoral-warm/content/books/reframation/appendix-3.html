<h1>Appendix 3</h1>
<h2>HAVING THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>One of the ways we have limited our seeing is by looking at the world through the distorting lens of what Paul calls the flesh and its associated rationality. The fleshly mind is contrasted with the spiritual mind. Each “mind” is what we might call a paradigm: a way of seeing and interpreting the world. The “fleshly” mind is one that interprets the world from a certain perspective, and, by its very nature, excludes information that can only be comprehended from the “spiritual” or the “mature” mind. The same issue is at stake in the interpretation of Scripture between the “Spirit and the letter” of the Word (2 Corinthians 3: 4–6).</p>
<p>The fleshly person (or the one who focuses on the literal dimension of the Word) fails to recognize God and the things of God—they simply cannot get it. Or, to mix the metaphor a bit, they can’t see the real meaning of things from within the darkened rationality of the cave.</p>
<p>It is because Christ lives in those who have received the Spirit that their stance and outlook can be those of Christ, and in this sense they are “spiritual.” Life in the Spirit (as opposed to a life in the flesh) has to do with how we read the world and how the world in turn reads us.</p>
<p>The spiritual person sees the world as a space filled with the sacred and the possibility of sacredness. Everything has meaning, and the world is radically open to possibility because it is a world where God really does reign. Everything is connected to God and takes place under his auspices.</p>
<p>Life in this view is dynamic and open. The spiritual person experiences God in all things. This does not mean that spiritual people are experts in every area of life. Rather, it means that they are able to appraise all things spiritually.</p>
<p>Conversely, the worldly (soulish – psychichoi) person has a priori refused this seeing and is thus enclosed in on self—the self and its survival has become the central concern. As what has sometimes been called “the false self,” the worldly mindset refuses the active reign of God, and in fact directly objects to his claims on our lives, actively seeking to obstruct God and the ways of God. Spiritual blindness is already built into the belief system. It cannot see God and the things of God. It is because of this that life in the flesh is closed and unmitigatedly tragic. Unable to see beyond the confines of his/her own thinking, the worldly must make their own way in the world which will always be ultimately meaningless. At the very least, there are depths and dimensions to life in the Spirit, which the person who lives on an entirely human level (1 Corinthians 2:14) simply cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Aspects of Christian existence remain an enigma, unless others share the same insight of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Jesus, Paul, and John particularly write about the issue of perception; of seeing through the worldly or through the spiritual eye... a way of seeing. This is what it means to have our perceptions cleansed, opened up to the realm of God through the power of the Spirit; to see things from the perspective of God... of eternity. This is a big challenge to a church that has reduced faith to formula, and worship to mere ritual.</p>
<p>But we have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16, cf. Philippians 2:5–8)!1 Did you hear that? Whatever else this means, at the very least it means that the believer is able to understand Jesus’ nous or paradigm, his way of thinking as it is revealed in and through God’s Spirit who mediates Jesus to us. Jesus’ nous is the realm of the real; it is a worldview in sync with God’s will; it is a soul that is in accordance with the new life God has put within (“I only do/see/speak as I see the Father doing/seeing/speaking” John 5:19, 8:28, 12:49).2 It’s a way of perceiving the world that opens up a whole new way of seeing for the believer. It’s a flinging open of the doors of perception to see the world as the Son sees it, to experience it in the same way he experienced it.</p>
<p>Living under the sovereign lordship of Jesus we can, and must, do everything in our power to see the world through the very distinct mind, rationality, and perspective of Christ. The Holy Spirit is God with us and will enable us to live into that dimension that the Bible calls the reign of God.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest, and soundest, way to start the journey of escape from the cloying confines of cave-rationality is to engage Jesus as if you were a participant of his original audiences. He uses metaphors all the time (seeds, birds, vineyards, trees, servants-master)—parables that invoke questioning and require a quest. His vision of the world can hardly be called small and cave-minded. In fact, he called all out of the cave in order to see things as they really are …eternal.</p>
<p>Appendi x 3 203</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encountering the Lord Jesus always gives the seeker a wider and deeper
perspective on God … always … then and now. In his earthly ministry, Jesus
engages with the all-too-predetermined dungeon-rationality of his time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, he says to traditionalist cave-dwellers, “You have heard it said … but I tell you” (Matthew 5:17–48, our italics), and then proceeds to give them a radically different take on the interpretation that had locked people into thinking about God and reality in a certain pre-determined way. No matter what situation, in word and deed, Jesus always surprises and does the unexpected. He speaks in puzzling parables and uses life metaphors (not rational code) that force people to see God in new and different ways.</p>
<p>He appeals to a deeper perception than was bequeathed to them by their forbears: “Whoever has ears, let them hear” (Matthew 11:15). We need to hear and see beyond that which is merely heard and said. Jesus requires the radical openness of a heart engagement that is searching for deeper and truer perceptions of the truth.</p>
