<h1>Foreword</h1>
<h2>DANIELLE STRICKLAND</h2>
<p>If you lived 2000 years ago or so and heard the ruckus John the Baptist and his revival movement was stirring from the margins, you’d probably want to go have a look for yourself. Picture yourself there, hearing the widely popular, wild-eyed prophet, camel hair shining in the brilliant sun, hair flowing in the desert wind as his voice booms through the swarming crowds, popping back protein-packed, snack-sized locusts between speeches to keep his game on. There is no doubt, as you listened to his fiery message, you’d be faced with a decision.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself standing at the edges of the crowd, your brain forced into a debate about the validity of the package as the aesthetics probably offend your religious modesty. Your ego rages at the nerve of the man to invite you to a public repentance (full immersion … really?), and, at the exact same moment of offense, your heart starts thumping, your spirit leaping, even soaring, as your eyes and ears open to a heightened sense of something coming, something real emerging. Maybe, just maybe, your heart tells you, it’s true. The kingdom is coming. The promises are true.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not too late and not too hard for God to show up—for the kingdom to come. Maybe there is hope for this broken world, healing for the wounds of humanity, a future for you and the people you love.</p>
<p>The change that John the Baptist introduced was made flesh in the person of Jesus. And Jesus was unlike anyone who had come before. He was so different that the people most dedicated to the Scriptures and the prophets didn’t recognize him. Even dear old John sent questions for confirmation from a prison cell as he felt his own end approaching: “Are you the one we were expecting?”1 I’m still not sure how we expect God’s kingdom to come in our time and in our current world. I have a hunch that, like those early religious leaders, we study the Scriptures with expectation but peer at the world with disdain.</p>
<p>Jesus never did that. Jesus saw the world through a kingdom lens, a divine perspective, a holy paradigm. And the way Jesus saw every situation and every person changed every thing. It made every blind man an opportunity for divine encounter, every woman a potential apostle, every beggar first place for discipleship, every religious leader a seeker, and, well, the results were extraordinary. The upside-down nature of God’s kingdom entered the world and has continually ebbed and flowed in increasing force and impact ever since. And yet, we still find ourselves at the mercy of our infantile intellects, bloated sensational news outlets, and the amazingly irritating human capacity for small-mindedness. We remain contained within human constructs and religious boundaries. We forget that the kingdom emerges and advances in the most unlikely of ways, through the most irritatingly unqualified people, spreads like wildflowers planted whimsically by a lovecrazed Gardener, and is brought to fullness by a truly wild King.</p>
<p>I'm trying to prepare you for the book you are about to read. Alan and Mark mean to reframe how you understand God and gospel, and a lot in between. And this prophetic call could not have come at a better time.</p>
<p>I believe that if we have eyes to see and ears to hear, we will understand that there has never been a more opportune time for the kingdom of God than right now. I still believe that Jesus is calling people to follow him into the wild edges of this blazingly beautiful world, and he’s calling them now like he called them then: “The time has come[…] The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p>The original call of Jesus sounds out loud and clear through the pages of this book. It is the Jesus Invitation, and the only possible thing to unleash authentic carriers of his wild gospel. The implications are quite simply the spreading beauty and transformation of this good news everywhere and to everyone. Reframe is a perfect word for a time in which repentance couldn’t be more important or strategic. I do not mean the old-fashioned evangelical version of repentance, preached with angry fervor to a crowd of wayward “sinners,” warning them of the fires of hell. But the original kind of repentance. The kind Jesus spoke of to the first disciples at the start of his gospel mission. It was not weary sinners that Jesus called to first follow him. It was the disciples of John the Baptist whom he first invited to repent.</p>
<p>In Greek the word repent is metanoia, which means to “change the way you see.” And how fitting is that?</p>
<p>The first calling is not to sinners but to saints. To disciples. To the folks who were present in the wilderness, seeking God’s kingdom and so close to the Truth they could taste it in the sandy desert grit blowing in the breeze and the holy fire burning into their souls. The thing is, Jesus doesn’t call the disciples of John from a place of religious fervor at the height of their Foreword xxi popular revival movement. He finds them much later, in fishing boats at the sea of Galilee. No doubt these disciples had returned to fishing after the arrest of their prophetic leader. Having faced the inevitable disdainful voice (external or internal) of shame, they licked their wounds and stopped trying to change the world. Instead, they just focused on feeding their own people, picking up the family business like their mothers had always hoped, and started plodding their way to retirement. It’s right at this moment that Jesus shows up and reframes them. Repent. Change the way you see. Jesus is calling, and he has a kingdom coming. Now is the time.</p>
<p>Let this book blow your mind and awaken your heart’s desire. You will hear the whisper in the wind of its words; you’ll recognize the original tune—it’s a gospel melody and it’s a holy Invitation. I hope it offends you, moves you, infuriates you, awakens you, alarms you, invites and inspires you to repentance. Because there is no time to waste. Alan and Mark have set themselves on fire. Come warm yourself to life by the holy flame.</p>
