</blockquote>
<p>Well, consider the example of Clarence Jordan. In his own unique way, Jordan lived an in/credible life.</p>
<p>Jordan didn’t set out to be anybody special. He didn’t set out to be the kind of person people would write books about, or plays about, or television documentaries about. He didn’t set out to lay the foundations for a project to build houses for poor people that would extend around the world. He didn’t set out to get people riled up and angry at him.</p>
<p>He started out as a simple small-town boy, born the middle child in a large family in Talbotton, Georgia, in 1912. It was just that Clarence just always saw things differently.1 Jordan is probably best known for his Cotton Patch Bible, a translation of the New Testament into southern vernacular, as well as being a preacher/ storyteller who was in high demand during the 1950s and 1960s, some time before civil rights became a mainstream issue in the States.2 But it wasn’t Jordan’s public proclamations about Jesus, his homiletical prowess, or his hermeneutical expertise that set him up as the antithesis to Harold Crick. Clarence Jordan lived a beautiful life, countering the fundamentalist evangelical culture of the time, which had bought deeply into a reduced truth, a reduced story, and a subsequently reduced life.</p>
<p>Growing up white and privileged in a divided and fractured part of the world, from a young age Jordan observed the racial injustice in the deep south—everything was separate, from schools to churches to neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Jordan could not find a way to reconcile the Jesus of the Gospels with evangelical practices, which chose the way of culture over the alternative, subversive story of the gospel. “During and after his seminary career Jordan became involved in the then-radical work of racial reconciliation.”3 Jordan dreamed of forming a community where people lived the story of Jesus, unreduced and whole. In 1942 he purchased a 400-acre farm just outside the town of Americus, Georgia in order to create an “incarnate community of the New Testament.” With an undergraduate degree in agriculture, Jordan wanted to be a scientific farmer, bringing the best agricultural practices to his home state in order to improve the lot of poor farmers, both black and white. He taught locals how to improve farming, rotate their crops, and fertilize their lands. He paid everyone equal wages, and welcomed black people and white people around his table (both extremely subversive acts in this era). His community, aptly named Koinonia (the Greek word for fellowship/communion) by this Greek scholar, began to provide the entire community with eggs and produce, and it even established a “cow library” (yes, it’s what it sounds like).</p>
<p>Eventually, as word slowly got around about Jordan’s radical way of life, he was asked to stop preaching at conferences around the country, as well as those close to home. He and his family were excommunicated from their local Baptist church for bringing a young man from India to church with them one day (the congregation didn’t believe he wasn’t African American).</p>
<p>The local community turned on Jordan and Koinonia by boycotting their roadside market, peppering their homes and businesses with gunfire, letting loose their farm animals, and chopping down their pecan trees. Local store owners refused to sell them supplies, their insurance was canceled, and no bank would do business with them.</p>

<p>It got worse; in 1957 the clandestine hate group Ku Klux Klan held a
rally in Americus, Georgia, driving seventy automobiles around Koinonia,
brandishing weapons and threatening acts of violence and death. Life

<p>Millard and Linda Fuller, the founders of Habitat for Humanity (an organization that has built more than 500,000 homes and has provided housing for more than 2.5 million people), birthed their radical idea of transforming housing while living at Jordan’s demonstration plot. The Fullers were mentored by Jordan before he died in 1969, at the age of fifty-seven. Linda Fuller writes, “We had never met a man with such deep understanding of what it means to be a Christian nor anyone who was as much like Jesus as Clarence Jordan. [...] He believed the essence of Christianity was incarnation; a spoken word without it being acted upon was absolutely meaningless.”5</p>

<p>This book is not simply a call to have a better grasp on theology or to be

</blockquote>
<p>It is not just speaking prophetically; it involves living prophetically, living heroically … just like Clarence Jordan. Not just studying theology but being theology.</p>
<p>If we are to develop a gospel proclamation that actually reframes the prevailing understanding of God and the world, then we will have to scrap our historical penchant for simply investing in scholastic study while disregarding the visible demonstration of theological doctrine in life itself.</p>
<p>We must adopt the posture of both/and. We must expand beyond mere study and verbal articulation to include an incarnational way of living.</p>
<p>This is why discipleship is so vital to the credibility of our proclamation The genuine disciple’s beliefs must come from a living, tangible relationship with God. In the Scriptures, knowing God (or the Truth) is less about being able to control and name the experience. To “know” God is more like the kind of knowing described when Adam knew (yâda) Eve and she conceived.6 This form of knowing involves a kind of union, a dialogical participation with the other. One must have at least a readiness to love God if one is going to have any chance of understanding him. In this light then, knowledge of God is less of an attempt to intellectually grasp God than it is an attempt to touch God. If we make it all about information about God then, “we allow ourselves to lose God behind some prop cardboard cut-out of God, mistaking the menu for the meal, and forgetting that music is the stuff of sound and motion, not marks of ink on paper.”7 The true disciple allows this relationship with God to transform them, incarnating their beliefs in his or her life—they live the truth they seek to proclaim. Theological truth cannot be divorced from life itself. It’s not enough to claim to know the truth as if it can be contained in a mere idea. It was Søren Kierkegaard who rightly asserted that all truth means subjective change.8 If I want to claim something to be true (in the religious sense particularly) then it must have changed my life, or my life itself will be communicating that I don’t really believe it to be true. Without tangible change, the medium of my life thus cancels out the message I claim to believe. There is nothing saintly about that. Demons believe that God is One, and they shudder at this truth (James 2:19), but it does not change them! Truth must impact and change us or, in the end, it will simply judge us. Or as theologian David Tracy says, “there is never an authentic disclosure of truth which is not also transformative.”9 Jesus, the Word made flesh, is the one example where the medium of a person’s life was most perfectly the message. Jesus was the definitive theological person in that he perfectly presented the will of the Father to the world. Discipleship must follow in this way of Jesus, for “everyone who I ’ ll Have What She ’ s Having 139 is fully trained will be like their teacher” (Luke 6:40). Authentic truth has to be incarnated in an act or in some action; the way of incarnation is the criterion of all real truth (1 John 2:22; 4:2), and “walking in the truth” is the way the believer possesses the truth (2 John 1–4; 3 John 3–4, etc.).10 We can therefore say that while Jesus is the (sole) incarnation of God, we all must in a real sense become incarnations of Jesus. In some analogical way, disciples of Jesus are meant to be living embodiments of Christ in the world.</p>
<p>The decisive factor for the spiritual greatness of a person is therefore not found in their logical teaching, but rather in their mode of life. It is for this reason that von Balthasar speaks about the exemplary disciple of Jesus (the “saint”) as a theological person.11 We like this term; it suggests that our life bespeaks theology and people are reading it all the time. It has been said that the definition of a saint is someone who makes it easier to believe in God.12 “Every person, by living authentically, shall become a Torah, an instruction.”13 Authentic disciples—people who really live their messages and so beautify truth—enrich the church in marvelous ways because they restore the balance between theory and practice, a balance that every new generation of Christians must strive to attain.14</p>
<h2>The Disciple As Ordinary Hero</h2>
<p>It is love that is the final defense of the faith. Jesus himself actually expected no other kind of apologetic when he said that it is by our love that the world will know we are his disciples (John 13:34–35). Love is therefore the defining mark of authenticity.15 It is not the theological manuals (full as these may be of unquestionable truths) that can plausibly express to the world the truth of the gospel, but rather the existence of the authentic, faithful, heroic disciples who have been grasped by Christ and his gospel.16 For instance, we can look at the work of Mother Teresa and observe someone who allowed God to “say” with her life the same kind of message he communicated through the life of his Son, Christ Jesus.17 Claiming to have doctrine down pat and to believe in all the right things (as important as these are) will never provide an adequate defense for Christianity. Because we are expected to express the beliefs we hold to be true, only the living embodiment of theology in and through the very life of the authentic disciple can serve as a viable defense (apology) of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, we all know that the in/credible witness of a true disciple is a far more effective way of reframing people’s understanding of God, church, and world than almost any other form of witness. When people encounter and observe someone who really lives the message, they are confronted with what Jesus looks like through the particular and unique form of the witness. The holiness of any authentic follower of Jesus displays something of the captivating beauty of God’s revelation in Christ, drawing those around them closer to God and to consider who Jesus is. This type of powerful witness is seen in the biblical heroes and disciples (e. g., Mary, Paul, John, Peter), in history (e. g., Augustine, Francis, Corrie ten Boom), but also in the Clarence Jordans of the world. It is equally true for all of us who claim to follow and love Jesus. J. V. Taylor, the British missiologist, once remarked, “How secondary, indeed how futile, are all the means of communication unless they are actually born out of the very truth they are meant to convey.” The authentic witness of a faithful believer enables others to be sympathetic to the Christian message and to receive the intellectual content of theology. The appeal of the theology being espoused is therefore somehow inextricably linked to the credibility and integrity of the believer in question. This also explains why a bad (or false) witness, or the apparent hypocrisy of believers, gives people and society a good excuse to reject the claims of Christ on their lives.</p>
<p>And it is important to note here that we are not referring simply to the role of individual witnesses in reframing God and gospel, but also to the irreplaceable role of the faith community. Lesslie Newbigin, probably the premier missiologist of our times, was convinced that “the primary reality of which we have to take account in seeking for a Christian impact on public life is the Christian congregation.” He pondered how it is possible that the gospel would be taken seriously in the West where the claims of Christ have been undermined by the false witness of historical Christendom. How indeed would the gospel be rendered credible again? He ends up claiming that “the only [believable] hermeneutic of the gospel is a congregation of men and women who believe it and live by it.” To be clear, in saying this he does not deny the importance of the many activities we employ to challenge public life with the gospel—evangelistic campaigns, distribution of Bibles and Christian literature, conferences etc. But he does say that these are all secondary, and that they have power to accomplish their purpose only as they are rooted in and lead back to a believing community.18 Hugh Halter, one of our dear friends and a brilliant practitioner of incarnational mission, says it like this: I ’ ll Have What She ’ s Having 141 The incarnational big-story gospel will require a place of discovery, where people will be able to see the truth before they hear about it. This place will not be a location but a community of people who are inclusive of everyone. These people will be making eternity attractive by how they live such selfless lives now, and will be modeling life in a New Kingdom in ways that will make it easy for other people to give it a try. People like this aren’t desperate to convert everyone; they are desperate to be like Jesus and to be where Jesus is.19</p>
<h2>Adding Beauty to Holiness</h2>
<p>Judaism has a name for the idea of making life and spirituality beautiful; it’s called hiddur mitzvah—hiddur meaning “to make beautiful” and mitzvah meaning “commandment, or good deed.”20 This ancient teaching is intended to communicate that one is not just to live in a way that merely obeys the commandments, but life is to be lived in a way that also beautifies them, and that life itself is thereby beautified in return. In the rabbis’ understanding, every opportunity to obey God is also an opportunity to “adorn” or “beautify” God.21 To reframe both God and the world in ways that make the gospel accessible and appealing, we suggest that we need to adopt some of this thinking, adding beauty to holiness.</p>
<p>To understand this call to hiddur mitzvah is to understand that life is not to be reduced to obeying the rules in order to satisfy a code of morality.</p>
<p>Instead, it is an Invitation to live a life that adorns the ways of God with mind-blowing beauty, not as a means to earn the love of God, but in response to the love of God.</p>
<p>This concept is very likely what Paul and Peter mean when they encourage disciples to “adorn” the gospel (Titus 2:10 and 1 Peter 2:12; 4:11); good works and holy lives, lived beautifully, glorify God and serve as credible witness. Aperson pleases God when he or she decorates their lives with good works, and the gospel itself is rendered beautiful in the eyes of those who behold it.</p>
<p>Paul has a similar idea in mind when he encourages the Ephesian believers to “live to the praise of his glorious grace” (Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14). Markus Barth, in his brilliant commentary on the epistle, says that God has for so long and intensively showered grace on his people that finally they cannot help but sing paeans to his splendid grace. According to 1 Corinthians 10:31 and Romans 15:5–6, eating, drinking, and all other human actions, including abstention, are to serve the praise of God’s glory.</p>
<p>“By its singing, shouting, dancing, moaning, in the face of the pitfalls of sin or misery, but equally under the shower of the mercies of God, God’s people are appointed to be a witness to God and a light among the nations, ‘my chosen people, the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise.’”22 Perhaps that great twentieth-century prophet, that voice crying out in the wilderness, can help us understand what it means to live beautifully— the one and only Fred Rogers. Aka “Mister Rogers,” this sweater-wearing, ordained Presbyterian minister was host of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, a U.S. children’s television show, for thirty-three years. He taught children (and adults) how to live in a way that told a different story. In 2002, a few months before his death, Mister Rogers gave a prophetic commencement address at Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school. In his characteristic childlike simplicity, Rogers reminded us all to: Be true to the best within you. Not just true to yourself, but to the best within you. I’m talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things, without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate. Peace that rises triumphant over war. And justice that proves more powerful than greed.23 In this address, Rogers summed up what he believed would be the mission of a new millennium in four simple words: “Make goodness attractive again.”24 Astory personified by goodness; a life that embodies beauty— very few things would be more attractive to those engaged in an existential quest for meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>Again, the proposal we are making in this chapter is that living an unreduced life calls for a new demonstration—a new way of approaching the world, which interposes the whole in contrast to the broken.</p>
<p>Compare the following two choices of how to live in the midst of a broken world: In July of AD 64, a great fire burned throughout Rome for over a week, destroying almost three quarters of the city. Rome’s emperor at the time, the unpopular and incredibly cruel Nero, “played his fiddle while Rome burned to the ground,” leaving over half the city homeless. The fiddle playing of Nero is probably more folktale than actual event (considering that fiddles did not come into existence until around the eleventh century).</p>
<p>However, “his gleeful indifference to the plight of his people is fact […] People suffered and Nero didn’t care. His city burned and Nero reveled in his well-protected life of luxury. His cold-heartedness in the tragedy was I ’ ll Have What She ’ s Having 143 proven when he built his ‘Golden Palace’ and ‘pleasure gardens’ on the ruins of the fire.”25 In stark contrast, consider Vedran Smailović. On May 27, 1992, during the Bosnian War, Smailović stood less than one hundred yards away from where twenty-two people were killed by a shell falling directly on them as they were waiting in line at a bakery. In response to this horrific event, Smailović, the principal cellist of the Sarajevo Opera Company at the time, did all he knew to do. In protest at the chaos, hatred, and stupidity of war, Smailović brought his cello out and sat in a chair in the middle of the crater left by the deadly explosion. Every day for twenty-two days (one day for each person killed on that spot) Smailović filled the air with beautiful music. As explosions and sniper fire rang throughout the street, this lone cellist risked his own life, protesting against the ugliness and brokenness of his city by holding up beauty in its face.</p>
<p>We live in an ugly and broken world, the pieces of which are far from being reassembled. But the ideal, the way God intended the world to be, still matters, even when reality does not reflect it. Showing up and living beautifully in an otherwise reduced world is still important. It reminds us there is something more, something higher, something better.</p>
<p>Can we tell a story of good news into a broken world by giving it a glimpse of a more beautiful way to live? Can we make goodness attractive again? Blaise Pascal chose this approach in the seventeenth century: For Pascal, there was little point in trying to persuade anyone of the truth of religious belief. The important thing, he argued, was to make people wish it were true, having caught sight of the rich and satisfying vision of reality it offered. Once such desire was implanted within the human heart, the human mind would eventually catch up with its deeper intuitions.26</p>
<h2>Living A Questionable Life</h2>
<p>Michael Frost, our zany and prophetic friend, talks about Christians needing to live a questionable life. He says that the life of those who believe in Jesus ought to arouse curiosity among those who do not believe, leading to questions and faith sharing. In other words, authentic followers of Jesus should live lives that cry out for an explanation that will inevitably involve recounting the impact of the gospel on their lives.</p>
<p>Behind this idea of living a life that evokes questions lies an axiom of communication theory that says that when predictability is high, impact is low. In other words, when the audience thinks they know what you’re going to say, and you go ahead and say it, your words will have very little impact. On the other hand, when an audience is surprised or intrigued, they will think long and hard about what they’ve heard. The point is that we should always try to live in a way that surprises if we want to really be heard and noticed.</p>
<p>Can we live lives that are so surprising (questionable) that people want to ask “Why?” when it comes to how we raise our families, how we approach career/money/stuff, how we throw the best parties, how we are willing to speak truth to power, or how we are committed to a just world?</p>
<p>We ought to live lives that are counter-cultural in the same way Jesus did.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is precisely what was going on throughout the book of Acts—they shared their possessions, fed the poor, supported the widow, embraced the outcast, honored slaves, and empowered women whom society had left voiceless.</p>
<p>Move ahead a couple of hundred years or so from Acts and you will discover that Christians were living questionable lives … so much so that the Roman emperor Julian became concerned that Christians might actually take over the empire! These “atheists” (referred to as such because they denied the pagan gods) had devoted themselves to sacrificial acts of kindness and to “love feasts” that fed the hungry and the poor. What were Julian’s big concerns?27</p>
<ul>
<li>These people actually feed others who are not a part of their church.</li>
<li>These people tend the graves of those who are not a part of their</li>
</ul>
<p>religion.</p>
<ul>
<li>These people actually absolve others of their debts and forgive their</li>
</ul>
<p>persecutors.</p>
<ul>
<li>These people practice hospitality and take people into their homes.</li>
<li>These people treat slaves as family.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to the brutality of life under Roman rule, “these people” were markedly different. They changed their world by surprising it. Is it possible that, at times, our best presentation of the gospel is simply living such a beautiful life that these pilgrims in Spain and Burners in Nevada begin to wonder if there might be, after all, something to this God we believe in?</p>
<p>In contrast, it is not hard for any reader to consider how the impact of the always-surprising good news of Jesus is diminished when we persist in our oh-so-tired and predictable ways of talking about God and gospel.</p>

<p>In a now-famous scene from the 1989 romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally, the two title characters are having lunch at Katz’s Delicatessen in Manhattan. The couple are arguing about a man’s ability to recognize when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference and that women do it all the time. Harry, his insecure male ego now offended, claims he would always know if a woman was faking it. And so, to prove her point, Sally vividly (and we should add fully clothed) fakes a very loud orgasm while other diners watch on somewhat incredulously.</p>
<p>At the end, the whole café is quiet. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron places her order with the now famous words: “I’ll have what she’s having.” 28 (By the way, Katz’s Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, “Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!”) This then is how we should live our lives … orgasmically. We should out-serve, out-suffer, out-party, out-work, out-love, out-give, out-live, and out-everything everyone else. We should live our lives in such a way that those observing us want to say, “I’ll have what they’re having.” A N A N T I D Ot E F O R T H E E M P T I N E S S O F EXISTENCE Throughout this book we are pursuing an openness to the mere possibility that there is a bigger story to live into. The emptiness of existence that so many experience is not the way it has to be. Is there a way to live, to contribute, to create beauty that could move us toward an antidote for this emptiness of existence? We propose there is, and we believe that living a questionable and surprising life is a strong start toward inviting others into an alternative reality; an alternative life to that of the mundane Greytown, Harold-Crick-like existence; a life filled with beauty brought about by those who feel called to play cellos in broken places and to make goodness attractive again.</p>
<p>The role of art, and of living an artful life, is significant in a world in search of meaning and beauty. Novelist and sci-fi writer Ursula K. Le Guin suggests that art is one of the ways we break routine thinking and allow our perceptions to be cleansed: The daily routine of most adults is so heavy and artificial that we are closed off to much of the world. We have to do this in order to get our work done. I think one purpose of art is to get us out of those routines.</p>
<p>When we hear music or poetry or stories, the world opens up again.29 Similarly, James K. A. Smith gives us more than a clue to one of the keys of reframation: “If you want to change how the world thinks, you first have to change how they imagine. That’s why, today, artists are our apologists.”30</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The arts speak to aspects of human nature ignored or denied by a culture
captivated by brutal notions of “efficiency” or quasi-scientific narratives
that reduce us to animality. It’s in literature, poetry, film, and so many
humanity—that we are created in God’s image, animated by hungers and
what I’ve called “cracks in the secular”—the recalcitrant mystery at the
Nein! to our disenchantment.31</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Poet/Priest</h2>
<p>Have we ever considered that it is possible we do not always have the “right” people, in the right places, with the right abilities communicating the story of God?</p>
<p>Is it possible that we have underestimated who actually has the greater influence in reframing the story of God? Or perhaps it is simply that we have a limited view of who is to have a voice in this reframing. G. K.</p>
<p>Chesterton wrote, “I don’t deny that there should be priests to remind men that they will one day die. I only say that at certain strange epochs it is necessary to have another kind of priests, called poets, actually to remind men that they are not dead yet.”32 We are living today at a “certain strange epoch” where we believe it is imperative to have other “kinds of priests.” Not by eliminating all others, but by encouraging a broader range of those who live and create a better, more beautiful story.</p>
<p>The universal search for hope and meaning is ever present and at times filled with overwhelming despair. It is into this existential search that the artist is called to enter in, not succumbing to the hopelessness but instead offering solace and remedy to this sensation of emptiness. This emptiness I ’ ll Have What She ’ s Having 147 of existence is what we have partially unpacked in chapters four and five. We believe “other kinds of priests” are one way out of the despair of longing and desire, and such priests would include those in the arts, in its broadest definition—the poets, the writers, the dancers, the actors, the painters, the musicians, the producers, the directors, the preachers (of course preaching is an art), the storytellers, the photographers, the teachers, and the ________ (insert any and all we have left out). The bringing about of the beauty of God is not just for clergy, the so-called professionals. Living a better story is not just the domain of the theologian or pastor, those trained in the “correct” systems or methods. Instead, it is demonstrated through the expression of art, in which the common search for meaning and truth is acknowledged and entered into. The arts will never convince anyone to believe in God—they are simply the frames. They lead people to consider the way the world works and to subsequently speak with a raw intensity and honesty about life both with and without God.</p>
<p>Eugene Peterson gives us good reason to explore an artful response, in that, “Artists make us insiders to the complexity and beauty of what we deal with every day but so often miss. They bring to our attention what is right before our eyes, within reach of our touch, help us hear sounds and combinations of sounds that our noise-deafened ears have never heard.”33 Art itself is inherently a great and surprising witness. It’s like throwing a banquet for hungry people, being hospitable to strangers, disclosing fascinating possibilities to people who are worn out or bored.</p>
<p>Artistry is integral to human life, and […] art is meant to hint at minor marvels, hurts, and mysteries that we may have missed. When a visual artist brightens up a neighbor’s perception with wonder, empathy, or a smidgen of hope, it becomes a thank-offering to build up the city of God.34 This is because the true artist seeks to engage the world, experiencing its cruel pain, but also at the same time its infinite possibility, and its inordinate beauty. In other words, true art is prophetic, and allows the outlines of a form or idea to slowly dawn according to its own terms. To borrow Emily Dickinson’s phrase again, it’s allowing an idea to “dazzle gradually,” rather than trying to shoehorn concepts into neatly packaged formulae.35 And the Christian artist is the person who opens him or herself to the Spirit, not in a passive way, but with all their senses keyed and alert, seeking to listen to and obey what is revealed by the Spirit in that process. In so doing, they harness all their ability and the materials available to them in order to faithfully fulfil the vision given by God.36 We are similarly called to live our lives, open to encounter with God on his own terms.37</p>
<h2>Repairing the Universe</h2>
<p>In a world fractured by copious reductionisms and heresies, it is this calling to live a broadly defined artistic life of beauty that allows us to find a way forward toward meaning, toward recognizing a role in living a story that reshapes our sense of God and the world.</p>
<p>In Jewish spirituality, many consider the most important task in life is to find what is broken in the world and to repair or heal it. This is the meaning of the phrase tikkun olam—to repair the world/universe. The faithful Jew assists God in the restoration and healing of the world through the mitzvah, the various acts of goodness and kindness that are done in accordance with the Torah, with God’s instruction. Faithful disciples therefore bear a responsibility not only for their own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large, for the establishment of godly qualities throughout the world—they are healers of a broken world and restorers of a lost glory.</p>
<p>Although a distinctly Jewish phrase, followers of Jesus can readily identify aspects of Jesus’ mission in the idea of tikkun olam. It is in and through Jesus that God is bringing all things together (Ephesians 1:9–10).</p>
<p>Jesus spoke of this “renewal of all things” (Matthew 19:28); Peter described the time when God would “restore everything” (Acts 3:19–21); and Paul tells us that, through Jesus, God has “reconcile-d] to himself all things” (Colossians 1:19–20). Paul also gives us a commissioning of sorts to participate in this renewal and restoration, “For we are the product of His hand, heaven’s poetry etched on lives [poema], created in the Anointed, Jesus, to accomplish the good works God arranged long ago” (Ephesians 2:10 The Voice). This participation in healing the world “gives concrete expression to our identity and community in Christ for the world. They are not the means to our salvation, not even our own idea. They are the embodiment of what ‘we are,’ of what God ‘has made us.’”38 Repairing the world is a fantastic metaphor that helps us articulate the mission of the church in light of the mission of Jesus. Just imagine! In his earthly ministry, Jesus repaired the breach between God and the human race, restoring right relationships between people, and modeling a life of love and service before all. In his redemptive work on the cross, Jesus atones for the world; he restores, heals, reconciles, and justifies the lost and I ’ ll Have What She ’ s Having 149 broken world. In his resurrection and ascension, Jesus (and all of us in him) brings all things back together again, restoring and repairing the universe and helping put the broken pieces back together once more (Colossians 1:15–20; Ephesians 1:15–23; 1 Corinthians 15:20–28). Christians in the Way/Pattern of Christ therefore work to apply and extend Jesus’ mission through the medium of their lives and actions. In all this, Jesus blazes the trail for those of us who follow in his Way.</p>
<p>Repairing, healing, and restoring the world in Jesus’ name and cause is a wonderful way to live a surprising life that has a positive impact. For one, it forces us to take ownership of the story we are living, as well as the story we tell—a story that can either contribute to or repair the brokenness of the world. We have a choice as to which story we adhere to and which story we are known by. But there is no way to avoid telling a story of some sorts with our lives—the way we live our lives is going to tell a story, whether we want it to or not.</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as an unwritten life, only a badly written one.”39 Our lives will either tell stories of individualism and self-reliance or stories of restoration and redemption—stories of ugliness or stories of beauty. We choose our Way.</p>

<p>THEO-DRAMA: PLAy INGOURPa Rt INTHE</p>

<p>—P L A Y A S I T U N F O L D S We have been given a role to play in this grand story of God, and to miss out on this contributes to a reduced life. N. T. Wright often writes about a theology of living, centered around the idea of an unfinished Shakespearean play. Wright asks us to imagine that we have been given a five-act play written by William Shakespeare. This play involves the very fate of the universe … so it is fraught. There’s just one problem, however: only four of the five acts have been written. And it is we who have now been invited to participate in the play that is missing its one crucial and final act.</p>
<p>What would we do? What would be our strategy? How would we play our role in finishing this play?40 Well... we have to assume we would study the first four acts pretty thoroughly. We would want to determine the pattern and the plot, to get inside the minds of the characters and their developmental arc in the narrative that has been going somewhere for the four previous acts. We would then attempt to enter into this fifth act and play the parts and assume the roles we have been given, according to the story as it has played out thus far. In doing so, we would bring Act Vto life, attempting to perform the play as best we can, with the hope of fulfilling the author’s original intention.</p>
<p>In Wright’s understanding, we are now living in the fifth act of this story of God. The first four acts have played themselves out thus far in the story of Scripture—from creation, to brokenness, to promises and covenants, to the culmination of the story found in the humanity and the divinity of Jesus. The first followers of Jesus we read about in Acts and the ensuing pages of the New Testament have given us a start. We are now called, and have been given the vocation (which actually mirrors the vocation given to man and woman in the garden) to pursue this way of God. We join him on mission as he continues to repair this broken mess of a world in the image of the final act—the act he has had in mind since the beginning of the story.</p>
<p>We understand and tell this beautiful story well when we discover our ultimate vocation is to play our role as best and as faithfully as we can in this grand and godly unfinished story. In the timeless words of the inimitable Walt Whitman, “The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.”41 SECTION 4</p>

<p>We have now explored the depth of our many reductions (section one),
noted the nature of our all too human limitations and longings (section
two), and proposed a way toward rediscovering a more re/enchanted way
final chapters that will hopefully reorient the reader to see what God is
in applying the process of reframation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we are so fixed to a formulaic understanding of God and gospel, we are guilty of a failure to notice the details, intricacies, and nuances of those around us. We therefore squander the opportunity to connect people with God in ways that really resonate with who they are, or with their longings for the beyond … for the sacred.</p>
<p>We believe that because, as Christians, our spiritual radar is tuned to the frequencies of different eras, we have become ignorant of the contemporary interests and concerns of the world in which we are called to witness to Jesus. There is a great need to reset this so-called radar to the very particular issues we are facing at the current moment. We need to be able to name what we are seeing and hearing and help provide pathways to the life-giving connections between people and their God.</p>
<p>Over the next two chapters we want to consider how these frequency adjustments might be approached, as we explore some basic rhythms of life and how we might begin to see the sacredness of the image of God buried deep in the souls of all people.</p>
