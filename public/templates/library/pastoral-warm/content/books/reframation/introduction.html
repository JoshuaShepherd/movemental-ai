<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>A Tale of Two Pilgrims</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Two summers ago, I (Mark) walked across Spain: over a period of twenty-eight days, my twenty-three-year-old son and I hiked over 450 miles through countryside and city, plateaus and mountains to complete a spiritual pilgrimage called the Camino de Santiago. Over 250,000 "pilgrims" walk at least a portion of the Camino every year. For me, this was both a spiritual journey as well as a sabbatical from my busy day-to-day life as a pastor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On our journey we met, walked, ate meals, and stayed in hostels with hundreds of different people. It was a genuine pleasure (in most instances) to meet and learn about each person. It took only a day or two of being on the trail to come to the conclusion that every initial conversation with other “pilgrims” always began with some variation of the following two questions: “Where did you start walking?” and “Why are you walking?” After those initial conversation starters, the discussion usually expanded to a broad range of topics, including the inevitable questions about home, family, and vocation.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I tried to explain what I do in life, a life spent in vocational ministry for at least the last thirty years.</p>
<p>“So, what does that mean … you’re like … a priest?” “No, not exactly. I lead, teach, and take care of people in a faith community in the heart of the city that gathers once a week and tries to live out what they believe about Jesus throughout their whole lives.” “So, yeah, you’re a priest.” And that was that. They had found their category for me.</p>
<p>Being outed as a “priest” always seemed to kill the conversation from that point on. For these pilgrims on the Camino, somehow my vocation as a “priest” had little to do with their own search for God, beauty, truth, or justice. Their notion of what constituted a spiritual life clearly had no place for people like me in it, and their spirituality had no way of viably engaging with, or interpreting, mine or any other form of Christianity they had ever seen represented.</p>
<p>This was somewhat alarming to me because I considered myself a decidedly spiritual person, but I apparently had no meaningful way to communicate any overt Christian understandings of God with the people I met on the Camino. Yet I felt like each and every one of us “pilgrims” on our way to Santiago de Compostela was searching for something.</p>
<p>Part of the pilgrimage involves a 5,000-foot climb to Cruz de Ferro, a “monumental Calvary” implanted in the Mountains of Leon. Each hiker carries with them, either from their home or from along the trail, a rock or multiple rocks that they leave at the foot of the sixteen-foot-high cross.</p>
<p>Most have a word or a message to someone or about someone written on them. The base of Cruz de Ferro is simply an accumulation of rocks left by pilgrims throughout the years. At the peak, alongside the mound of rocks, are a variety of other items, such as clothing, shoes, and notes. For many people these objects represented some of the baggage that weighed them down in life, whether that be family, relationships, or physical or mental health issues. Many were emotionally overcome as they symbolically left behind this difficult aspect of their lives. From my perspective, and seemingly unbeknown to them, this whole process was a confession of a search for something or Someone beyond their understanding—a quest for some meaning to their existence.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, all of us traversing the Camino had some sort of yearnings for divinity, community, beauty, justice, truth, and the like. Regardless of our differences in beliefs, there was an overwhelming sense we were all part of the same spiritual narrative in some way. These and other existential issues form this human experience—they are the very stuff of spirituality. Yet I found myself, the “professional Christian,” walking this spiritual journey on the Camino, with no idea how to connect my experience of God in any way that might resonate with whatever these fellow pilgrims were searching for, as they walked those hundreds of miles through rural Spain.</p>
<p>What was it about my spirituality that did not seem to translate to Larissa from Germany, or Phil from Ireland, or Rosa from Spain? What was I missing? What wasn’t I communicating correctly about this calling upon my life and the God I followed? I had done the educational and spiritual training, and most of my adult life had been spent in vocational ministry.</p>
<p>My experiences and opportunities to communicate the good news of Jesus were far ranging and, I thought, extensive. So, what was I failing to see and to express?</p>
<p>We should all be forced to wrestle with a plethora of these types of questions, many of which are deeper and broader than we have ever thought Introduction xxxv to consider: what indeed is spirituality? Who or what is God? Where do I find meaning? And how do we come to know what is true and meaningful in a world of deception? And what exactly are we all looking for? What road ought we to take? Who is trustworthy enough to guide us?</p>
<p>These are some of the all-too-human issues we seek to bring to awareness at the very start of this book. We do so in the hope of making new and surprising connections between God’s mysterious ways of reaching out to us and the myriad of human ways of experiencing God.</p>
<h2>Another Kind of Pilgrimage</h2>
<p>For the past ten years or so, I (Alan) and my wife, Deb, have made a regular pilgrimage of a somewhat different nature. While hardly being as overtly religious as the Way of St. James, the Burning Man gathering remains, in my opinion, one of the most explicit spiritual quests in current Western culture. Every year around 70,000 people from every walk of life descend on one of the most remote and desolate places in Black Rock Desert, Nevada: an ancient dried-up lake bed called Black Rock City, or simply “The Playa” by the “Burners” themselves.</p>
<p>While the die-hard Burners insist that things are changing and the gathering is becoming way too mainstream, by far the majority of participants are there not simply to party. Instead, they view the whole experience as something of a personal pilgrimage. For some this involves a whole year of preparation and planning.</p>
<p>In many ways far more energetically spiritual than the average church service, the real religious quest behind Burning Man is not at all hard to discern: conversations about God, spirit, meaning, love, and beauty are everywhere present and encouraged. And not only is Burning Man a celebration of some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen, it is also what is called a “gift economy.” It is an incredibly generous place where nothing is for sale and everything can be given. In fact, everyone is expected to bring something to share with others, be it a piece of art, an act of service, an idea, music, dance, or simply a meal or a libation shared with random people walking past your tent. Collectively, Burners end up donating tens of millions of dollars by sharing some of the most magnificent artwork ever seen (just look online at images of “Burning Man Photography” and be amazed). Remarkably, many of these art pieces will be burned during the week to signify that art cannot be possessed by the wealthy; it is to be experienced equally by all and then relinquished—itself quite a statement in the obsessively acquisitive world we all inhabit.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to experience radical self-reliance where each Burner brings everything they need for the event, as well as radical selfexpression—each individual is at liberty to express themselves in whatever way they see fit. Because all are accepted for who they are, or as who they present themselves to be, Burning Man is somewhat of a celebration of human creativity, with people dressing in some of the most original costumes seen anywhere. It is weird, wild, and intriguingly wonderful.</p>
<p>The week climaxes with two major experiences, which define the whole event: the first is the burning of “The Man” on the Saturday night. The Man is a huge, fifty-foot, cruciform statue, symbolically situated at the very center of the camp, and it functions as the reference point for the week, hence the festival’s name. The second major event, the burning of “The Temple”—itself a magnificent structure that any wealthy art collector would probably pay many millions of dollars to own—exemplifies the deeply spiritual nature of the Burn. During the week, the Temple is the designated place where people “do business with God” (or the “Universe,” the “Universal Spirit,” the “True Self,” or whatever). They mourn the loss of friends that year, make restitution, or bring something—a shrine or some other symbol—that represents an event that is significant for them.</p>
<p>Burners can write poems or prayers on the walls, or construct a little personal shrine to remember a loved one or a broken relationship—it’s a very special place and people treat it with reverence.</p>
<p>Whereas the burning of the Man releases what can only be called Dionysian energies—it is a wild party that goes all night—the burning of the Temple on the Sunday night is a completely different affair. Over 70,000 people gather together in reverent silence. Then, at sundown, the temple is lit on fire, and the stunningly beautiful, fire-dyed flames consume the building. At this point people begin to openly weep, wail, and mourn. As misdirected as much of this seems to be to a Christian, it is nonetheless an incredibly sacred, genuinely “religious” moment where the whole city opens itself to “otherness,” to God, to others, to their own suffering, to the affirmation of life, and to the yearning for forgiveness.</p>
<h2>In Search Of So Much More</h2>
<p>Most Christians would probably dismiss Burning Man as a debauched pagan festival, fueled by drugs, nudity, and sex, and the Camino as a misguided appropriation of the Christian understanding of pilgrimage—a vain attempt to create meaning in an increasingly meaningless world. And Introduction xxxvii while these various dimensions are most certainly present, in our experience they are by no means the primary dynamic going on at the Playa or on the roads to Santiago. Implicit in these modern-day pilgrimages is a search for God, even if the participants cannot fully name what is really going on.</p>
<p>These contemporary pilgrimages are far more spiritual than might first appear to the critical onlooker. In fact, these experiences, and the numerous others like them scattered across our cultural landscapes, might well contain clues vital to unlocking both the power of the gospel and to accessing the real desires of the human heart in our time. In the process of coming to grips with the nature of the spiritual quest going on in the world, we might well also renew our own tired, middle-class, churchly, adventureless spiritualities. Avoiding engagement with communities like those of the Playa or the Camino will, in the end, undermine our own experience of God and diminish our understanding and application of the gospel.</p>
<p>Genuine missional engagement with culture always ends in renewal of the church and its spirituality.</p>
<p>Most people remain highly interested in God/Being/Spirit; most will readily affirm, even inevitably propose, that Jesus is one of the greatest people who ever lived—often he would be at the top of the list; and most people are searching for identity, meaning, belonging, and purpose in whatever pilgrimage they find themselves on. They are spiritually searching in all corners of culture, much more than might appear at first glance. What has become clear is that many simply cannot draw a straight line between these spiritual pilgrimages and the church or those who represent this Jesus. This is partly because they cannot readily interpret their own actions as questing, but also because they cannot see any relevance in the church today and the story of God being told. This goes some way to explaining why Mark’s fellow pilgrims on the Camino failed to recognize either him or his vocation as “spiritual.” Perhaps more alarming for Christianity than atheism is the rise of the so called Nones and Dones. The Nones can be categorized as those professing no particular religious faith, not because they have no belief in God or gods but because they simply perceive no real need for it. Nones see no ultimate reason for any particular religious beliefs about a divine being and in fact reject the claims of all religions to be able to make such assertions. In comparison, the so-called Dones are a rapidly increasing demographic who no longer believe they need the institutional church to practice whatever belief in God they may have left. Many in this category claim they had to leave the church in order to find God. In addition to this, there is also xx an increasing cultural gap between the church and Millennials—who are looking for purpose, community, and authenticity in faith communities— and yet for many their only experience of the established church is of religious activity, judgment, and hypocrisy.2 These current cultural analyses obviously shed some light on why the average person on the Camino discounts the spirituality of someone in a religious vocation. If the message, whether perceived or actual, is one of hypocritical, heartless judgment, then no one desires an encounter with someone giving that kind of “good” news.</p>
<p>Taken together, these are not just problems of perception, or ones of church attendance in decline, but a serious spiritual crisis. This is a missionally profound moment of truth because our capacity to function as credible witnesses of God and gospel is at stake. We are not witnessing to the incredibly good news of Jesus in ways that either make sense or resonate.</p>
<p>Culture is telling us something here: whatever we appear to be expressing through our standard churchly offerings (traditional or contemporary) is simply not connecting with increasing portions of our populations, who are in search of something so much more.</p>
<p>The human quest for God can take many forms. We need to learn to construct ways to recognize this, and, as witnesses, help when and where necessary. We believe humans are wired for this search for God from the start, and express that intuition in countless ways. We also believe that God, who has made us and knows us more deeply than we know ourselves, has communicated to us and is actively reaching out to us in ways far too numerous to list. In fact, human beings are haunted by God and simply cannot escape the fact that life is lived under the auspices of eternity. The passageways are simply everywhere, if searchers are willing to open their hearts—the doors of their spiritual imagination and consciousness.</p>
<p>In this universal search, it is not that God has stopped making himself known. Rather it is that people (both those with belief and without) are unfortunately seeking the right things in the wrong places. The ability to discover and experience God in this search has been greatly diminished because, as Christians, we have invariably reduced the reality down to a religious formula or some church/clergy-bound sacrament, forgetting what a biblical encounter with God looks and feels like. In this book we will spend a lot of time trying to name and identify the religious quest taking place in the husk of everyday life, and we will seek to reconnect these quests to the many-sided grace of God that comes to us in the wonders of creation, in the complex mysteries of culture, and throughout the human story.</p>
<p>Introduction xxxix</p>
<h2>A Call to Reframing</h2>
<p>We live in a world that is constantly on a pilgrimage, searching and longing for so much more. Yet, as we will attempt to describe throughout the book, followers of Jesus struggle to articulate the story of God in a way that brings clarity and understanding to these longings, this world, and our place within it. This inability to recognize and respond aptly is what Walter Brueggemann refers to as a “crisis of interpretation,” a crisis that results in followers of Jesus being robbed of the capacity to speak, to care, and to notice those in the Nevada desert, on a trail in rural Spain, or anywhere in between.3 Our driving force, the “why” behind the following pages, is the deeply held conviction that there is a great need for a reframation that allows us to see God, people, and mission through re/enchanted frames. We want to seriously consider how it is that we tell and live the story of God in the midst of this pervading “crisis of interpretation.” This is not simply an evangelism problem, nor a “give me a new zappy formula so I might share the gospel” type of discussion. This is not about telling a story designed to get people to “sign up,” but instead to begin to reframe how we see and understand all sorts of pilgrims’ tales. We want to consider what it might look like to enter into the story of God, allowing that good news to personally transform us in such a way that any communication of that story recognizes and addresses the deep longings and hungers of those around us. It is therefore a vibrant story of God that we invite others into—one that literally changes and transforms everything about them and their world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Flow of the Reframing Conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you will soon see, we believe many of our problems arise from the narrowing reductions in our framing of God, people, gospel, and the world. This has already been a significant theme in Alan's writings to this point, but in these pages we will more thoroughly explore this idea. In the first half of the book, we will identify and name what we perceive to be critical reductions in our framing of God and the world, and in the second, we will suggest ways to enlarge the frames.</p>
<p>So, the flow of this reframing conversation will be as follows: In section one, we attempt to make the case that a reduction has taken place throughout cultural Christianity. We will explore how these reductions affect our beliefs about God, the story we tell others, and the life we live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section two attempts to explore the longings for truth and beauty
that are innate to all. We also expose just how narrow and limited our
perceptions of truth have become.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In section three, the turn is made into a re/enchanting of what it might look like to move toward seeing differently, learning to tell a better story and to live a more beautiful life.</p>
<p>And in section four, we conclude with a re/learning of some rhythms and practices that will help us find ways to perceive and understand the keys to culture.</p>
<p>Through this book, we want to be able to help followers of Jesus enter into a more authentic dialogue, a conversation with pilgrims on the Camino and the Playa and everywhere in between—conversations that “deepen the argument of being alive.”4 We also want to acknowledge our impoverished stewardship of both the good news of Jesus and the rule and reign of God, of which we all share responsibility. Remember, our goal is not to change the story but rather to take a picture we have all grown accustomed to, and surround it with a new frame, one that allows us to see the picture afresh.</p>
<p>This reframing does not actually change the picture, but it allows for a second thought, and a third. It enables us to see a picture we have too easily defined and contained, siphoning out the breadth of mystery and meaning that every pilgrim on any trail longs to experience.</p>
<p>In the movie Dead Poets Society, John Keating told his students, “I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way. The world looks very different from up here. You don’t believe me? Come see for yourselves.”5 In the same way, this reframation that allows us to see God, people, and mission through ever-expansive frames, does not change the picture; it is simply standing on the desk, enabling our perception and perspective to be changed. It is not modifying the meaning; it is bringing out the color, texture, and vibrancy already present. And to do so will require a fresh approach. As the French artist Henri Matisse said, “To look at something as though we had never seen it before requires great courage.”6 If we are able to consider a reframing of this extraordinary story of good news, we believe the beauty, the mystery, the wonder, and the glory will return, and it will connect and resonate with real human longings and desires.</p>
<p>May we be so courageous.</p>
<h2>Section One: A Reduction</h2>
<p>What are the origins of our struggle to communicate the sacred story? Who or what is responsible for this disconnect between the longings of the world and the good news of a God who desires his people and all things to be restored to himself?</p>
<p>It is the root of these challenges that we seek to address in these first three chapters. If we are to effectively share the story of God into a world that includes searching pilgrims from rural northwest Spain to the desert of Nevada to our churches, coffee shops, workplaces, and everywhere in between, it will require more than a few simple tweaks to our message here and there. Instead, there must be an honest and careful exploration into a series of reductions, recognizing the domino effect a reduction in one area has on another, and then another, and so it continues. Or, more specifically to the content of section one: our framework of God has been reduced, which has led to the reduction of the radical story of Jesus, which in turn results in a life that reflects those same reductionisms.</p>
<p>An urgent response to this searching involves a radical rethinking and revisioning of our way of seeing, thinking, and experiencing God, the world, and the mission of God. We readily admit that this radical reframing can appear to be somewhat overwhelming. But we urge you to keep your mind and heart open, and to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal his truth to you as you begin to see and identify some of the long-held reductions we, as the people of God, have made.</p>
