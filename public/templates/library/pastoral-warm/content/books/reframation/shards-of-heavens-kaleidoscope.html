<h2>— MARTIN BUBER</h2>
<p>The 1927 novel Death Comes for the Archbishop, set in the New Mexico territories at the turn of the twentieth century, is a story of Roman Catholic missionaries attempting to establish a diocese and bring the gospel to a melting pot of frontier families, Mexican settlers, and Native Americans.</p>
<p>At one point, one of the priests, Father Vaillant, describes an experience that gives him a clue to his missionary vocation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Down near Tucson, a Pima I ndian convert once asked me to go off into
the desert with him, as he had something to show me. He took me into
a place so wild that a man less accustomed to these things might have
of black rock, and there in the depths of a cave, he showed me a golden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His ancestors had hidden these sacred objects there when the mission was sacked by Apaches, he did not know how many generations ago. The secret had been handed down in his family, and I was the first priest who had ever come to restore to God his own. To me, that is the situation in a parable. The Faith, in that wild frontier, is like a buried treasure; they guard it, but they do not know how to use it to their soul’s salvation.</p>
<p>Aword, a prayer, a service, is all that is needed to free these souls in bondage. I confess I am covetous of that mission. I desire to be the man who restores these lost children to God. It will be the greatest happiness of my life.1 This narrative of discovered artifacts would come to represent a calling for Father Vaillant: the buried sacred objects were symbolic of the image of God buried deep in the souls of all people. The missionary task was not to bring God to them but to uncover these relics of faith and assist people to use this knowledge and understanding to pursue the restoration found in the gospel of Jesus. Father Vaillant’s divinely appointed vocation, he discerned, was to unearth this treasure and “restore to God his own.”</p>
<h2>Missing The Key</h2>
<p>I (Alan) rediscovered this idea of buried artifacts the hard way. About four years ago, my dad passed away. He had not been in good health for over a decade, and as Deb and I have been living in the U.S., we would often receive phone calls from my brother and sister informing of us of another hospital visit or some new treatment plan. Eventually that dreaded call came asking us to instantly return to Australia, as Dad had just a few days left. We immediately flew home to be with my family and share the last few days together with my father.</p>
<p>Now a bit of backstory: Dad could not by any stretch of the imagination be considered a spiritual or religious man, or a seeker of truth—quite the opposite. And he also was not given to reading much at all. The onebook I am aware of him reading in his adult life was Chariots of the Gods, in which Swiss author Eric von Däniken makes claims about extraterrestrial influences on early human culture.2 For some reason, this captured my dad’s imagination and, from his perspective, it offered a plausible rationale for the origins of human life and civilization. It also, in my mind at least, gave him a way to dodge responsibility for the moral and existential claims of the biblical God.</p>
<p>Oddly, during the last few days of his life, Dad kept asking the believers in our family about the “rod and the staff” mentioned in Psalm 23. Many of Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 157 my Christian family members began to think Dad was now all of a sudden interested in the Bible, and proceeded to share with him devotionals about the Lord being the Shepherd of our lives, and how he leads us through the valley of the shadow of death, etc. I knew better. I’d had numerous previous conversations with him about how he believed the rod and the staff were in fact secret weapons given to Moses by aliens—weapons that could split waters, allow his armies to win, and draw water from a rock. These were the secrets to Israel’s apparent success. So, far from being curious about the spiritual meaning of Psalm 23, I felt that Dad was in fact “sticking it” to those of us who believed the Bible. I must admit to being somewhat angry with him for mocking us, even as he lay on his deathbed. I thought, “I nappropriate, Dad!” On the night he died, we were all gathered around his bed. (It was not pretty as he was really struggling for breath.) Deb noticed a Gideon Bible by the bedside and suggested we should read Psalm 23 to him, given he had been inquiring about it over the last few days. I was too emotional for this, and so my brother read the psalm while I concentrated on praying for Dad and watching his face. Almost unbelievably, as we came to the verse mentioning the rod and the staff, my father died. I mean, right on that verse! He entered eternity with those particular words resounding in his ears.</p>
<p>I have to admit this shook me up. What could that possibly mean? I don’t believe this was a sign of his salvation (although of course I would not exclude that), but I do think it is significant for me and for the purposes of this book. I have come to believe that through those interminable arguments about aliens and pyramids, disagreements I dismissed as a cheap substitute for real faith dialogue, Dad was actually giving me a key to his soul … and I had missed it. This drove me back to the rediscovery of what I had previously understood about the artifacts of faith that lie buried in every human soul. Amoment of reframation if ever there was one.</p>
<p>Recall how, in chapter four, we discussed various ways in which God might reach into this world, and how the world around us and our own experiences are full of “clues,” the signals of transcendence, that point us to a world beyond … to the meaning of the universe. We observed how these clues present themselves to us in innumerable ways if only we would pay attention. We also looked at how there is an innate longing in us all for something else, as mysterious as it might be. Now consider von Balthasar’s brilliant insight into the fundamentally religious human condition: Man is the creature with a mystery in his heart that is bigger than himself.</p>
<p>He is built like a tabernacle around a most sacred mystery [...] It is already there, its very nature is readiness, receptivity, the will to surrender to what is greater, to acknowledge the deeper truth, to cease hostilities in the face of the more constant love. Certainly, in the sinner, this sanctuary is neglected and forgotten, like an overgrown tomb or an attic choked with rubbish, and it needs an effort to clean it up and make it habitable for the divine Guest. But the room itself does not need to be built: it is already there and always has been, at the very center of man.3 “The room itself does not need to be built: It is already there.” What if my dad’s obsession with aliens was the clue to opening his heart to God? What if I had simply followed the clues to my dad’s belief system (something inherent to us all), which might have disclosed the existential roots in my father’s particular search for meaning in the possibility of aliens? Why was this idea of aliens and UFOs so important to him? What religious need was it addressing? What existential/religious questions was he attempting to resolve? Don’t all humans seek to know where they came from, to know the purpose of their lives, and to know where it is all heading? My dad’s belief might well have been misdirected, but it was belief nonetheless, and as one of God’s good news people, I ought to have taken it more seriously.</p>
<p>This personal story exemplifies our belief that every individual person, in fact every corporate culture, is similarly offering to us the keys to their souls. But because we are so fixed to a formulaic understanding of God and gospel, we are not listening. We therefore fail to even notice these keys, squandering the opportunity to connect people with God in ways that really resonate with their sacred longings as they experience them. Our missionary calling, one similar to Father Vaillant’s, is to uncover the image of God that is longing to be found in each and every person. The keys to the soul have been misplaced and it is going to take some hard work, looking in places we have never considered before, to find what has been lost.</p>
<h2>Become A Detective Of Divinity</h2>
<p>As proclaimers of Jesus and his story, as people who live in an enchanted universe filled with rumors of God and of angels, it is important for us learn how to recognize the myriad ways that God touches us outside the realm of what is explicitly “religious.” Once we begin to see this, we can then bring the meaning and context to what people are experiencing. God touches us through painful growth experiences of loss and grief, through Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 159 moments of creative and athletic excellence, through times of victory over our problems, through the tenderness of relationships, and through encounters with the exquisite nature of creation. God’s grace falls on the just and the unjust alike; all humanity experiences God’s hand. These moments when we touch something eternal and noble and good are God’s footprints in our lives—his prevenient grace (see chapter ten). People need to realize that the God they feel they do not know has, in fact, already been at work in their lives in many ways.4 The Canadian theologian and preacher Bruxy Cavey once posted this enticing tweet, inviting believers to become detectives of divinity: “God leaves a trail of breadcrumbs in nature, art, science, religion, and every individual life—all leading toward Jesus. Today, let’s be alert, stay curious, ask questions, and share the Gospel so we can partner with God and help people complete the journey.”5 Missionally speaking, this is what the Jesuits mean in their motto of “finding God in all things.” The metaphor of being a detective, following clues in people’s lives and in culture, is a very useful one.</p>
<p>We can take a cue from James Reece (a character in the TV series Criminal Minds) regarding the kind of clues we are looking for. “There are certain clues at a crime scene which by their very nature do not lend themselves to being collected or examined. How does one collect love, rage, hatred, fear? Yet, these are the things that we’re trained to look for.”6</p>

<p>SHOWMEYo URIDOLSANDI’LLSHOWYo U</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—W H O Y O U A R E If you love to travel, then you know when the opportunity comes to visit a new city, there is the temptation to take the road most traveled, going from tourist trap to tourist trap. It’s easy to follow the Frommer’s Travel Guides, signing up for the double-decker bus tour, and filling a visit with so much frenetic activity that the true essence of the city is neither seen nor experienced. However, probably the best way to see and experience a city is to walk it, paying attention as you go to the culture, the people, the customs, the sights, and the sounds. One can enter into the heart of a place by walking a neighborhood or two.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts, we read of Paul attuning his radar to the metropolis of Athens, a city famous for philosophy, architecture, politics, and literature. While exploring the streets, we get the impression he is paying attention and taking note of the spiritual environment of the people God has called him to. We are told, “he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols”(Acts 17:16 NRSV).</p>
<p>The idols of a people say a lot about a city. Just to recap, an idol is anything we try to use to fill what only God can fill, and is therefore anything we use to replace God. Idols are those dimensions of our lives to which we have ascribed ultimate value. When an object, person, or ideology becomes the means by which we try to fill our innermost need for unconditional love, unsurpassable worth, and absolute security, it becomes an idol. Idols often become the quicker, alternative route as we unsuccessfully attempt to fulfill our insatiable longings—longings that will not rest until they find their place in God. As we have seen, humans have an inbuilt homing device that, if allowed to operate according to its original design, will inevitably lead them to God. Idolatry jams up what ought to be an innate instinct for God. Idols are embodiments of misdirected worship, allowing people to falsely satisfy their innate God-hunger.</p>
<p>In the secular West, we typically try to find meaning through what we achieve, what we possess, or whom we impress. It is because of the existential weight invested in them that idols serve as significant pointers to what we think is important in life. Show me your idols, and I’ll show you who you are. This, in turn, forces us to ask: what really is being valued/ worshipped? What existential issues are being addressed? Why is this so important? Apeople’s idols are huge clues to the hearts of both individuals and culture.</p>
<p>To be honest, the description we read of Athens (being “full of idols”) sounds like any other city or town any of us have ever known, whether it be big or small, urban or country. Tim Keller therefore rightly advises wouldbe missionaries to this culture that engaging people through the lens of idolatry is a more appropriate, more profoundly biblical key to unlocking the souls of the people than justification by faith now is.7 He is in good company … Paul thought so too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pa U L F O U N D H I S K E Y S
Engaging his hearers through the lens of idolatry is exactly Paul’s approach
in his speech on Mars Hill (Acts 17). The fact that he was “deeply distressed”
spirit, he empathetically attuned himself to the context. He began to search
least three ways:8
First, “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious”
and their idols, in an attempt to uncover the dynamics of their religious
dilemmas that all humans face. As we have already noted, idols almost
protection from the perils of nature, the need for approval, the need for
Athens or ours today, are sustained by the various dominant stories that
into the human heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decoding a people’s religion(s) inevitably involves identifying the defining meaning-narratives of the city/people. This means sorting through those narratives and stories that endure and support a specific line of belief.</p>
<p>For instance, when Paul references an idol to “an unknown god,” it is highly likely this was a reference to the Corn King, the god Ceres—from where we get our term cereal; this god was seen to die every year (in the form of a seed) and rise again (in the form of the harvest). From this narrative/ metaphor of the Corn King, Paul is able to draw a direct line to the death and resurrection of Jesus as the basis of cosmic renewal and salvation.9 The natural forces of renewal reflected in the idol and the associated belief system, are fulfilled by Jesus.</p>
<p>What are the dominant narratives in our world today and what elements within each of them support a particular way of believing? What kind of morality and ethics are actually present in these stories? What beliefs are being expressed? What longings are on display that we are missing because we’ve simply accepted these stories? Why do they capture our attention again and again in an endless cycle? Those are the questions Paul had to ask in Athens and the same ones we need to ask today. Why is the political climate in America at a ridiculously fevered pitch? Is it because we have made being “right” and in control an idol? Why do comfort and financial security drive us to the unhealthiest of places? Is it because the idol of materialism has overtaken us? What has brought about the phenomenon of “helicopter parents”? Is it the idol of safety and control, and the constant element of living in fear?</p>
<p>Second, “Agroup of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, ‘What is this babbler trying to say?’” (Acts 17:18). Interestingly, the term "babbler" translates as a "scavenger of thoughts." These sophisticated thinkers saw Paul as someone digging around for bits and pieces of philosophy and theology, scavenging for the “shards of heaven’s kaleidoscope” in the collective Athenian soul.</p>
<p>Here we are told that Paul engaged with that quintessentially Greek phenomenon, the philosophers. If Paul was to have any chance of unlocking the Athenian cultural code—or anywhere in the Greco-Roman world for that matter—he would have to grasp the significance of the Hellenist’s drive to express what is real through philosophy. As detectives searching for clues, it’s important to understand that philosophy, at its best, is an honest human quest to make sense of the world.</p>
<p>The questions we must therefore wrestle through include: can we engage and involve ourselves in philosophical thinking, discussions, and debate (without drawing the lines of separation and raining judgment down on the “wrong” side)? As we pay attention to the culture within which we are immersed—who is being read, what are the current bestsellers, who are the influential authors (both academic and pop culture) … and why? Agreat example of this would be author Brené Brown. What nerve has she struck that her TED Talk on “The Power of Vulnerability” has been watched over 38 million times?10 What is it about her books that has intrigued individuals across a broad spectrum? Or what is it about the British Philosopher Alain de Botton’s writing that has struck such a chord? Or why the fascination with the recent popularity of psychology professor Jordan Peterson, an incredibly polarizing author and speaker? Or you can go more technical and ask the same questions about the thinking of Slavoj Žižek or Friedrich Nietzsche? What is it about their messages that resonates in today’s society?</p>
<p>We cannot be afraid to ask those questions and have those conversations.</p>
<p>And third, in Paul’s approach to the Athenians, “As some of your own poets have said”(Acts 17:28). We can affirm that all true art involves some search for meaning, the love of beauty, and the struggle with the tragic. For the Greeks, artists functioned in a similar way to the prophets of the Bible, and poets were often referred to as such. Prophets “speak more than they know”—their words (or drama, or paintings) hint at a surplus of meaning (a thousand words in one line) that is significant for the society of which they are a part. Paul the missionary intuitively knew this, and so in Athens he studied their artistic expressions, seeking keys to understand and unlock their ultimate desires.</p>
<p>To help us understand our own twenty-first-century culture, we need to be aware of the artists, poets, and songwriters who are currently attempting to unlock our ultimate desires. We need to consider why some succeed greatly and others fail miserably. Why is it that superhero movies Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 163 seem to have endless appeal, and millions of people cannot wait to see what I ron Man will do next? Is it because our culture severely lacks anything resembling heroism and we are desperate to find someone we can believe in? Or consider the brilliant movie Get Out. Director Jordan Peele’s film isn’t just entertainment—it is a commentary on race and prejudice, with prophetic undertones. What are the movies that have connected with the zeitgeist of culture, and why exactly?</p>
<p>Some of the most powerful poets/prophets of our day are the comedians who have struck a cultural chord in a rather uncertain world. The Dave Chapelles, Hannah Gadsbys, and the Trevor Noahs of our world are speaking words that contain a portion of the angst so many people feel but do not know how to articulate. And they are being recognized for their presence in the cultural discourse—Noah, as a satirist, was named one of Time Magazine’s Top 100 Most I nfluential People in the World in 2018.</p>
<p>Are we working hard enough to get a pulse on a world so desperate for so many things to be put in their right place? If not, it is most likely because we are either too lazy to put the work in or because we are simply afraid of something being too “unclean” for our sanctified sensibilities.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can make the same observations about the power of music and the influence of songwriters. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan’s songs had a gravitational pull to a generation desperately seeking something they were not experiencing anywhere else. Today, Kendrick Lamar and Donald Glover seem to communicate messages that unlock the ultimate desires in people who often feel on the edges of culture. Donald Glover’s “This is America” video, released under his musical moniker Childish Gambino (and now viewed over 500 million times), is packed with cultural metaphors and symbolism, clearly resonating with many living in the middle of racial conflict.11 Following Paul’s example, we must pay attention to the messages our musicians are conveying, as key voices in our culture.</p>
<p>We must be active in all dimensions of human life, especially at the cultural level, because culture is the sphere where people and societies share common meaning. As part of the redemption of all aspects of life, we should be actively interpreting movies, literature, pop-culture, experiences, new religious movements, and the like. It is precisely these things that have the elements of human searching and yearning in them that must be correlated to the mind and heart of God if they are to be redeemed.</p>
<p>In answering a call to mission, we need to grapple with the heart resonance, the desires, the griefs, of our “city,” our “Athens,” and the way those longings are expressed through any and all artistic expressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to pay attention to the songs that grab a generation, the movies
that seem to have high resonance and impact, the literature that captures
portions of cultures. What are they ultimately communicating? Are they
most meaning? What are the primary metaphors? What religious aspect or</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Von Balthasar claims that “all great art is religious, an act of homage before the glory of what exists,” and the greatness of that art—what in fact makes it religious—is its capacity to transmit that glory and to inspire a response, a transformation, in the subject.”12 The gospel should always be restated in engagement with the dominant myths, dreams, and images of the age, that is, with the contemporary quest-patterns of a changing world. Therefore we simply cannot avoid some understanding of the preeminent ideas that have informed, and continue to inform, our culture.</p>
<h2>Not Simply "What" But "Why"</h2>
<p>As we learn to be missional anthropologists, we need to not only have an understanding of “what” a culture engages in, but “why” as well.</p>
<p>In the book Culture Code Clotaire Rapaille writes of his experience of being hired by the food and beverage company Nestlé to assist them in their attempt to sell instant coffee in Japan in the 1970s. (Areminder from chapter four—Rapaille is renowned for his research into the determining factors influencing an individual’s particular ideas and behaviors.) Nestlé’s strategy prior to hiring Rapaille was to simply convince the Japanese consumers to make the switch from tea to coffee. They believed they could persuade the Japanese culture to love coffee. They were sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>The narrative of tea was deeply embedded in the culture of the Japanese people. Still, to this day, tea is the most commonly consumed beverage in Japan and is an important part of their culture. “The Tea Ceremony” or “The Way of the Tea” is a ceremonial way of preparing and drinking tea, and there are informal tea gatherings (chakai) and formal tea gatherings (chaji). Some of these events can last up to four hours. These ceremonies represent the inner, or spiritual experiences of the Japanese people. They take their tea very seriously. If Nestlé was to bring instant coffee into a tea culture in Japan, they were going to have to understand the emotional attachment to tea as well as what attachments, if any, they had to coffee.</p>
<p>Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 165</p>
<p>Rapaille describes how he gathered focus groups together to understand better how they each felt about coffee, in the hope of learning something that would benefit Nestlé. He tried various activities with the groups, all designed to bring participants back to their first imprint of coffee and the emotion attached to it. In most cases, though, the journey led nowhere.</p>
<p>It was determined that their strategy to encourage consumers to switch from tea to coffee could only fail. Coffee could not compete with tea in the Japanese culture if it had such weak emotional resonance. To have any success they must give the product meaning. They needed to create an imprint for coffee in Japanese culture.13 Every narrative of every culture is made up of imprints passed down in a multitude of ways over many years and which are deeply rooted; more deeply rooted than we are often willing to take the time to understand.</p>
<p>Again, understanding a culture’s beliefs and behaviors as a whole is not about the “what” as much as it is about the “why.” This seemed to be the way of Jesus. Ever notice how Jesus never answers a question with a straight answer? There doesn’t seem to be a single occasion where Jesus answers a question directly.14 Almost always he puts his finger on the real issue—the subtext—of the matters of the heart, including motivation, sinful disposition, and will. In so doing, he speaks into the existential issue presenting itself—it is partly this that makes Jesus’ appeal so mysteriously compelling and relevant.15 In Athens we see Paul—that archetypal apostle to the Gentiles—doing what Jesus did (and what Rapaille suggests we do) by going directly to the issue-behind-the-issue implied in the explicit cultural expressions of the Athenians. By engaging its art, poetry, philosophy, and religion, he is effectively deciphering the culture code of that ancient city. He is thus able to speak with resonance to the issues that, to the Hellenic peoples, had historically been their concern. Ultimately, for Paul and for us, it is about learning to address the heart of the matter.</p>
<h2>Follow the Traces</h2>
<p>So then, following Paul’s example, go into your neighborhood, into the places of education, into people’s lives, and look for the evidence, the signals of transcendence, the traces of God. Spot the clues of everyday love, rage, servanthood. Here is a short summary list, along with a few more suggestions, to help you in becoming a better detective of divinity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with prayerful attention: because you want to know what God</li>
</ul>
<p>is already doing in that context or that person’s life, we suggest that you ask God. “Lord, what are you doing right now in this home, pub, workplace?” Go on prayer walks, asking the Spirit to reveal what God feels and thinks about what is going on.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Look for the dominant metaphors in culture: for instance, the so called “digital natives” (those generations who are born into the digital world and feel completely at home in it) already have metaphors that correspond quite well to those of an invisible spiritual world … the internet and virtual reality. Digital Natives already believe in a world in which you can move back and forth, in the same way the wardrobe was an entrance into the enchanted world of Narnia. They don’t have to talk about purely objective facts to know that things are there; in the same way they don’t have to talk about location and spots on the compass to know that space is there.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is “the blink” you get of the neighborhood? Deb Hirsch (yes,</li>
</ul>
<p>that one) has developed an innovative approach to mission that she calls incarnational reality. This involves us learning how to engage our world with all our (spiritual) senses in an attempt to get a full picture of the context. What’s the flavor of the neighborhood—does it leave a bad or good taste? Where are the smells—what draws you in and what repels you? What do you see if you look with the eyes of faith? What are you hearing—where are its cries of desperation or shouts of joy?16</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>What are the people’s values and activities telling you about themselves? Where do they spend time? What do they really value?</p>
<p>What are their political affiliations and how invested are they in them … and why?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are they (not) reading? If they don’t read, where are they getting</li>
</ul>
<p>their information from? Who is defining them? If narrative gives us identity (as we’ve already noted), what narratives are defining them?</p>
<p>What story do they tell themselves in order to make meaning and to negotiate their way in the world?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are their heroes? Why? The logic here is “show me your</li>
</ul>
<p>heroes and I will show you who you are.” This is because heroes are embodiments of what we value and believe. Apeople’s heroes are often found in their comic books, literature, and on the sports field, etc.</p>
<p>Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 167</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to their music: if you’ve not already noticed, we believe</li>
</ul>
<p>that music is one of the most fertile areas for detective work. The lyrical content alone is huge. Try reading the lyrics of great songs and gauge their poetic strength—be it U2, Bob Dylan, Tupac, Hozier, Passenger, Joni Mitchell, or Kanye West. Beyond the lyrics themselves, ask yourself what is the mood of the music? What makes it resonate with the soul’s search for beauty, justice, relationship, and spirituality?</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the movies that seem to have resonance in the group. As we’ve</li>
</ul>
<p>already noted, movies give us multiple clues about our culture. What questions are they answering? What yearnings are they appealing to?</p>
<p>Sense the drama in the narrative. Who is it that the viewer is bonding with, and why? Does the movie embody a cry for redemption? For rescue? For adventure, perhaps? Love or the despair of lovelessness?</p>
<p>These are the existential questions that concern us all.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Explore the nature of their religious quest—both implicit and explicit. Suspend your judgment as to whether you agree or not.</p>
<p>Form an outline of their basic religious quest (the search for meaning, identity, purpose, and belonging) that is evident in their overt forms of religion but also in their art, poetry, and literature that reveal the soul. Remember, at root all people are spiritual. Humanity is haunted by divinity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The bad news, however, is this: people are looking for the right thing in the wrong places. They are going door-to-door searching for that which is true in an attempt to make sense of our world. But what we see played out in front of us day after day might be best described in country musician Johnny Lee’s words. In his classic song from that bull ridin’, hard livin’, country line dancin’ cinematic masterpiece Urban Cowboy, Lee informs us, “We are looking for love in all the wrong places.”17 Or if you are less into country music and more into science fiction, the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode “Looking for par’Mach in All the Wrong Places” is titled in tribute to Lee’s song. (Par’Mach is defined in the episode as “the Klingon word for love, but with more aggressive overtones.”)18 While not considering ourselves fluent in Klingon or country music, both these examples illustrate the ubiquitous phenomenon of searching for the right things in all the wrong places.</p>
<p>According to James K. A. Smith, “The effect of the brokenness in the world is not that we stop being lovers, not that it turns off our love and desires. The effect of sin and brokenness and fallenness is that we start loving the wrong things.”19 Because our souls are restless, because there are deep longings within us all, because there is a desire to love and be known, the question is not “will we love?” but “what will we love?” And the idols we attach ourselves to, especially the besetting and oft repeated ones, provide a profound insight into our inner world and motivations. The French phenomenologist Jean-Luc Marion teaches about the nature of “saturated phenomena.” These are signifying events in which something “more” is present. He especially points to idolatry as an example of this. The idol is a saturated phenomenon because it captures our attention more acutely and holds more meaning than other objects, and, as a result, it carries religious significance.20 The difficulty comes in learning to strip back the overt idolatry in order to expose the inherent yearning for divinity, understanding that God is the fulfilment and completion of all human longing.</p>
<p>G. K. Chesterton reputedly said, “The man knocking on the door of a brothel is unconsciously looking for God.” Or a more contemporary translation might be: the young man or woman who swipes right on Tinder is really looking for God. This behavior is clearly broken, and we are not condoning it. But to understand the significance of this, instead of judging the action, ask yourself what is really being sought when a person pays someone else for sex? Or what is going on in the innumerable fleeting sexual encounters happening today? Let’s identify and name the subtext: the answer ought to highlight the existential quest motivating the action.</p>
<p>So it could be an attempt to overcome loneliness in human connection. It could be a search for momentary relief from pain, drudgery, or boredom.</p>
<p>It may be the desire to dominate or abuse—this in itself is caused by root issues that can be traced to the existential concerns of the heart.</p>
<p>While they may not overtly acknowledge it, the one ringing the bell of the brothel is covertly reaching for personal union with Beauty, Love, and Joy.</p>
<p>Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 169 The books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things—the beauty, the memory of our own past—are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshippers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.21 (I talics ours.) Or, consider another possible example of misdirection: when a person goes to a clairvoyant, they are exposing themselves to the occult, but at least in so doing they have indicated they are really interested in the future and their particular role or fate within it. Yes, there is a confusion of means and ends. That we are not denying. But the missional challenge here is to suspend your judgment and try not to critique the overtly sinful behaviour.</p>
<p>Instead, look at the person and what is really being sought and why.</p>
<p>The same “looking for the right things in the wrong places” approach can be seen in one of the most prevalent phenomena in every human life … the problem of addiction. There is something in the human condition that will substitute reality with false, idolatrous alternatives when it cannot, or will not, engage with real life; addiction is just one way humans attempt to deny reality.</p>
<p>Let’s analyze drug addiction as an example: what is the existential subtext when people are taking drugs? There are probably two broad reasons—first, the need to medicate or alleviate a sense of anxiety or pain at facing life, and second, a desire to be lifted out of what is perceived to be a dull and boring life, to experience a form of ecstasy.22 The addict’s strategy is an attempt to short-circuit the hard work of real engagement with the issues at stake. He or she has instead taken to a counterfeit method of escaping pain or chosen a shortcut to gain real pleasure.</p>
<p>Drugs are inherently spiritual—that is part of their appeal. Sure, drugs are cheap alternatives to real prayer and spirituality, which require sacrifice and discipline, but that does not mean they don’t fulfill something of a spirituality. My (Alan) own testimony confirms this; as a young man I can still recall how my friends and I used to get high, and we almost inevitably ended up talking about God, the cosmos, meaning/lessness, love, and of course good and evil. In fact, when the leader of our circle had an encounter with the Holy Spirit at a local Pentecostal church one night, he brought the good news of Jesus right into our midst, and he ended up leading me to Jesus. I discovered that everything I was seeking for in drugs—a yearning for ecstatic experience and/or the escape from meaningless suffering—was perfectly fulfilled through Christ. There were no churches, evangelistic rallies, or any “Christians” involved at all—that all came later. In my ongoing involvement among people on the edge (Burning Man or the local city), I have seen time and again that God will be found by those who seek him, no matter which way they might come to him. That is true for all our stories, not just those of the drug-addicted.</p>
<p>Addictions are just symptoms of some deep brokenness at the core of human nature. They occur when the most basic of drives, yearnings, and desires that can only ultimately be fulfilled in God, are substituted with those things, people, ideas that promise everything, but deliver only bondage and death. Again, a prime example of looking for the right things in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Obviously, this thinking can be applied to any behavior. The issue is the direction or misdirection of our loves and desires. As we explored in chapter four, Augustine wrote of ordered and disordered loves and of evil being a perversion or negation of the good. C. S. Lewis similarly taught that all our vices are really virtues gone wrong—of looking for the right things in the wrong places.23</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too
weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex
and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who
what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily
If we require proof of these misdirected desires, we simply need only
really looking for in the places our longings take us? Recognizing our
mirror of all human desire. It will allow us to see each other for who we
than others. So the next time we feel unable to connect with people who
belonging, for joy, and our longing for something beautiful. We can at least
who are just driven by money and prestige, think about our own desires for
Shards of Heaven ’ s Kaleidoscope 171
we are, in the end, all beggars pointing out to the other beggars where to
must learn to meet others.</p>

<h2>Unwrapping the Wounds of Culture</h2>
<p>The good news is that, even in the midst of our common brokenness, Jesus has entered in and drawn close to us in a world full of division and hurt and has offered an opportunity to find the right thing in the right places.</p>
<p>And we can look to him, as always, for an example of how exactly to go about this.</p>
<p>In a fascinating story in John’s Gospel, the author tells us that Jesus has to go through Samaria on one of his journeys. He has to go through this land of division and animosity, a land with centuries of volatility based upon centuries of widespread scorn and deep hatred. This is the land Jesus has to go through.</p>
<p>He arrives at a well at noon, in the heat of the day, thirsty. While there, a Samaritan woman comes to the well alone (a sign she is most likely ostracized from her own community). Jesus asks her for a drink, and, in doing so, breaks through two cultural barriers: One, she is Samaritan and, two, she is a woman.</p>
<p>The woman is taken aback by this Jewish man speaking to her, but even more so when he tells her, “If you knew the generosity of God and who I am, you would be asking me for a drink, and I would give you fresh, living water” (John 4:10 MSG). The woman appears to be a combination of amused and dumbfounded. And then, almost out of the blue, Jesus gets personal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” The woman
answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying,
‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you have</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>John 4:16–18 NRSV</h2>
<p>(Sometimes it doesn’t seem fair to have a conversation with Jesus.) Jesus speaks not only to a Samaritan, but a Samaritan woman; a Samaritan woman who had been married five times. But notice, in Jesus’ voice there is no disqualification, no condemnation. Instead, Jesus appeals to the desire of her heart with great compassion, to the place she has looked for love for so long, and he points out the dehumanizing cycle she has become trapped in by going from relationship to relationship, none of which have brought her what she really wanted or needed. Jesus takes the cover off her life.</p>
<p>Her response? Religious talk—a discussion about which temple is the “right” temple. For her, as is the case for many today, engaging in “religious” talk is easier than being transparent about the brokenness of her life. Jesus does not fall for it. He paints a picture of God, not as a place to worship, but as a person to be experienced.</p>
<p>Jesus bridged the cultural distance. He entered into the division and hatred and moved in close, going against accepted cultural norms. Jesus offered her the very thing she had spent her life searching for but had been unable to find. Refusing to get caught up in a discussion about religion, he instead focused on the good news he was bringing. He didn't speak to her about morality or purity. Instead, Jesus spoke of her thirst, her longing.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, the woman had long desired only that which Jesus could give, and here, at this well, she was just beginning to understand what that was.</p>
<p>Jesus gave this woman a picture of God that she and others had never seen before. You might even say he brought about a great reframation in her understanding of the divine. If, in our search for the keys to a culture, and in our quest to uncover the sacred artifacts embedded deeply in each person—if we are able to take seriously the example of Paul in Athens and Jesus in Samaria—we just might accomplish a similar reframing.</p>
