<h2>(A LIFE GREATLY REDUCED)</h2>

<p>Hell is a state of mind—ye never said a truer word. And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Heaven is not a state of mind. Heaven is reality itself. All that is fully real is Heavenly. For all that can be shaken will be shaken and only the unshakeable remains.</p>

<p>The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.</p>
<h2>— ALBERT EINSTEIN</h2>
<p>In the movie Stranger Than Fiction, Will Ferrell (in his most atypical of roles) plays a “seemingly average and generally solitary IRS agent.” Ferrell’s character, Harold Crick, starts to hear a disembodied female voice narrating his every action, thought, and feeling in alarmingly precise detail, which only he can hear. His carefully controlled, OCD life as a tax agent is turned upside down. The narrator seemingly begins to determine his entire life, from his work to his love interests, and even to his death. When the voice suddenly declares that “the character Harold Crick is facing imminent death,” Harold realizes he had better find out who it is who has taken hold of writing his story and, by whatever means, persuade her to change this fatalistic ending.</p>
<p>Much to his chagrin, Harold is told there’s really nothing he can do, and that he is to just let the story take him: “Just do what you want to do, you really have no choice … Harold, you could just eat nothing but pancakes if you wanted.” Harold emphatically responds, “I don’t wanna eat nothing but pancakes.</p>
<p>I wanna live. Who in their right mind in a choice between pancakes and living … chooses pancakes?” He is advised, “Harold, if you’d pause to think, I believe you’d realize that that answer’s inextricably contingent upon the type of life being led and, of course … the quality of the pancakes.” “You have to understand,” Harold says, “that this isn’t a philosophy or a literary theory or a story to me. It’s my life.” Harold recognizes that in order to change this impending tragic ending, he must proactively enter into the story and change it by involving himself, rather than allowing lazy indifference and empty rituals to determine him.</p>
<p>In other words, Harold determines to live a better story. The result is seen near the end of the movie, when the narrator comments: Harold Crick became stronger in who he was, what he wanted, and why he was alive. Harold no longer ate alone. He no longer counted his toothbrush strokes. He no longer wore neckties. And, therefore, no longer worried about the time it took to put them on. He no longer counted his steps to the bus stop. Instead, Harold did that which had terrified him before. That which had eluded him Monday through Friday for so many years. That which the unrelenting lyrics of numerous punk-rock songs told him to do: Harold Crick lived his life.1 Stranger Than Fiction is the story of a man who has been asleep for most of his life and suddenly wakes to realize he has very little time left in a life he’s barely lived. He grasps hold of the reality that he has the chance to do something that is universally desired—to actually live a better story.</p>
<h2>A Third Reduction</h2>
<p>In so many ways this is a parable of our contemporary Christian experience.</p>
<p>If we are honest we, as the church, have by and large failed to live the fullness of life we have been given by Jesus.2 This eclipsing of the grandeur Stranded in Grey Town 41 of truth (chapter one) and the failure to live into a Warhead-infused Story as it unfolds (chapter two) have a sad and inexorable outcome: a severely cramped existence, eking out a life as it passes by.</p>
<p>In this chapter—as part of this first section of the book exploring various reductionisms—we want to consider how so many of God's people end up with a rather sad, attenuated, moralistic, adventure-less, and churchy spirituality by which they scrape out something of a spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Why would any pilgrim on any trail or at any art festival have any interest in the type of reduced life that is portrayed to them by the average churchly Christian? Why do we talk about the satisfaction of eating pancakes when the Story we have been called to was described by Jesus as a “real and eternal life, more and better life than they ever dreamed of” (John 10:10 MSG)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HELL’SDOORSARELo CKEDFROMTHEINSIDE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps one of the most disconcerting portrayals of the reduced life is found in The Great Divorce. This book by C. S. Lewis is not only a brilliant parable about how the dynamics of heaven and hell play out in everyday human life, but is also an outstanding example of the sheer power myth, imagination, and story have to renew life. The story is set against a backdrop of Grey Town, a rather loveless, grumpy, and alienated “place,” where the miserable inhabitants of the town—Lewis calls them the “shrunken souls of the damned” and “greasy stains on a window pane”—live increasingly insubstantial, ghost-like lives.</p>
<p>Early in the parable we learn that Grey Town is ever-expanding because the inhabitants inevitably quarrel and are constantly moving further and further apart to get away from one another. This is a relatively easy accomplishment because, in this hell of a place, all they need to do to build a new house is to think it. Apparently, in Grey Town “you get everything you want (although of poor quality, of course) by just imagining it.” There are no constraints: the undisciplined desires of the insiders create an unreal and disordered world, well-suited to their preferences.</p>
<p>But evil desires are at odds with joy, so that even though in some sense the damned get what they want, they are left empty and frustrated. What they want is to be happy on their own terms, but that is impossible, so strictly speaking they do not get what they want after all, even though Grey Town endlessly adapts and expands to their wishes.3 This description of Grey Town is strikingly different to Lewis’ version of heaven, where everything is available upon request but is only given on God’s terms. These substantial, authentic gifts and graces of God are in stark contrast to the flimsy, poor-quality reality of Grey Town.</p>
<p>What if, Lewis wonders, these damned souls were permitted to ride a bus from hell toward heaven? And what if, when they got halfway there, they were met by the souls of the blessed who, arriving from heaven, try to convince them, even at this halfway point, this place of decision, to give up their sin and pride and embrace the mercy of Christ? What would they do?</p>
<p>Astonishingly, we find that in all but one instance, the unrepentant sinners freely choose to return to hell (Grey Town) where they will carry on their ghostlike, thin existence until finally they are infinitely alienated from God, each other, and therefore ultimately from their own selves. Their rejection of grace has not only blinded them to the truth, it has robbed them of their own humanity. To borrow a phrase from The Last Battle, they are so afraid of being taken in by the saints sent to help them that they cannot be taken out of their self-imposed imprisonment and willful exile from God.4 One of the more startling aspects of The Great Divorce is that many live in hell without even knowing it. The problem is that this hellish existence passes off as normal for all those who are in it. And what is more shocking is that, according to Lewis, this would include many who claim to be believers but who refuse The Way of following Jesus.</p>
<p>An implicit message of Lewis’ book is the implications our choices have on the direction of our life. Where we find ourselves has a lot to do with whether we choose to retreat into the alienated and reduced life (i. e. Grey Town) or venture into a larger experience of life offered to us in God. Hell is a mindset that comes about through the willful narrowing of life until what we have left is insubstantial … unreal … fractured … and hellish.</p>
<p>“Hell is a state of mind […] And every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell” (italics ours).5 Therefore Lewis warns us that: Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature.6 The key idea of The Great Divorce is that the damned are, in a real sense, successful rebels to the end; and that people actually do get to choose hell Stranded in Grey Town 43 over heaven. What Lewis is saying to us here is that hell’s doors are locked from the inside.7 It is all in the little choices we make on a daily basis, in our daily accepting or rejecting of God’s grace.</p>
<p>Our choices and perspectives matter … hugely. There is a quality of heaven or hell in the decisions we make that determines the meaning and trajectory of our lives. Both these processes begin long before death.</p>
<p>“The good person’s past begins to change so that his forgiven sins and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven: the bad man’s past already conforms to his badness and is filled only with dreariness.”8 And herein lies the danger of the shrunken or reduced human life—the life in Grey Town. It is this “state of mind” that we are hoping to address in the call for all people everywhere to learn what Harold Crick learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LIVINGCIVILIZEDINTHEUNITEDSTat ESOFGENERICA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timothy Tennent, President of Asbury Seminary and one-time missionary laments that: Our long sojourn under the spell of Christendom has also meant that we find ourselves adhering to a rather domesticated version of the gospel.</p>
<p>One of the legacies of Christendom is that it is willing to provide a safe haven for Christianity, but only at the cost of the steady domestication of Christianity, gradually smoothing down most of its rough prophetic edges, so that Christian identity and cultural identity became virtually seamless.9 The seminal missiologist David Bosch likewise observes that, “Christianity has become nothing but the religious dimension of the culture” and “ listening to the church, society hears only the sound of its own music.”10 The problem is that contemporary Christianity is the product of the longterm, religious domestication process that has been going on for hundreds and hundreds of years. In the words of Mickey Goldmill, of the Rocky movie franchise, who gruffly tells Rocky after a defeat, “The worst thing happened that could happen to any fighter: you got civilized.”11 Asimilar fate has fallen on those of us following Jesus: we have become civilized and domesticated in both our living and telling, and in doing so the gospel itself has been likewise domesticated. Like the proverbial frog in the kettle, Western Christians are now largely unaware that they are living out a significantly reduced experience of the good news of Jesus than the one portrayed in the New Testament.</p>
<h2>Unca Lonny Says</h2>
<p>Lonny Davis, a zany friend of Alan’s who goes by the tag Unca Lonny, claims that most Christians experience their faith as deists. He says: Deism pretty much sums up the present state of things with regard to the faith posture of the Western world. It goes like this: God created the world, sent Jesus, gave us the Bible, and then walked away, left it up to us to work it out from there. We have to settle for a religion pretty much void of wonder, the supernatural, and an unmediated engagement with God, but we get to go to church instead. As long as we get this basic “theory” correct, and as long as we maintain a keen desire to exert moral order, we’re good to go.12 Sociologists Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton agree with Unca Lonny. In their 2005 book Soul Searching, they suggest a form of deism that has entrenched itself in our time—they call it Moralistic Therapeutic Deism (MTD).13 The research shows that MTD involves a simplistic, formulaic, and moralistic creed to which many people’s faith can be reduced.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is moralistic in that faith is reduced to rules for a happy life—do</li>
</ul>
<p>not intentionally hurt anyone and be decent to people around you.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is therapeutic insofar that religion is reduced to a self-help tool</li>
</ul>
<p>that is used only when needed. The goal is to live in a way that “makes you happiest.”</p>
<ul>
<li>It is deistic because God is reduced to a removed and distant Being.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not atheistic, as there is a creator “out there somewhere,” but this god is perceived to be somewhat indifferent to human concerns and uninvolved in the drama of life, except maybe to grant a child a wish now and then.</p>
<p>The problem with deism is that it lacks radical openness and receptivity; it is closed to the possibility of God’s involvement in real life and history, and does not cultivate the personal vulnerability required to truly know God and be known by him. It claims to have knowledge about God—more like facts about God—while lacking any knowledge of God. It certainly has no real experience of living in a covenantal relationship with God, one that has a dynamic give and take. In other words, it is an inherently closed and codified religion. Reduced.</p>
<p>It is rather like living a day-to-day faith akin to a carefully controlled, OCD life as a tax agent named Harold, counting toothbrush strokes because it is the pathway not only to better dental hygiene but a nice, good life. It is a reduced belief that participating in the right things (moralistic) Stranded in Grey Town 45 will result in controlled happiness (therapeutic) for which you will be glad to give thanks to the God above and beyond (deistic). It is simply living a life of church-going goodness that never questions if there is more than dutiful participation in programs and ministries designed to bring about a feeling that you are achieving your best life now, (i. e. eating pancakes).</p>
<p>Why would anyone we meet on the Camino or on the Playa come to desire a spiritual life that is centered on simply putting moralistic rules in place so we can be happy and sing songs to a distant God?</p>
<p>Acivilized, domesticated, MTD approach implies that life’s great longings and questions are responded to with a shrug and a “meh … whatever.” This “whatever shrug” is the result of sinful pride, but it is also caused by a lack of understanding and desire to enter into a much more dynamic (theistic) experience of God—a God who is fully involved in all the dimensions of individual and corporate life. Recognize it now?</p>
<p>This latent MTD that literally pervades middle-class evangelical Christianity has domesticated and civilized faith by locking it down in tight, largely moralistic formulations—the god in the back pocket, the god who doesn’t mess with our plans, a god appropriately reduced to fit to a reduced life.</p>
<p>Perhaps a major force undergirding this latent domestication is the combination of the self-protective obsessions of safety and security (derived from our middle-class interests) and comfort and convenience (derived from the worldliness of systemic consumerism).14 Make no mistake, these forces that are so prevalent in our culture will always tend to reduce the effect of discipleship and weaken what the Bible would define as appropriate faithfulness and abundant living.</p>
<p>This desire to seal ourselves off from the life God intended will actually take some careful planning if we are to avoid any distress or danger, but it will also lead to a meaningless life marked by lovelessness. As C. S. Lewis says in his characteristically potent way: There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations [distresses] of love is Hell.15 To shut ourselves off from the world inevitably leads to this “lovelessness,” which is itself hellish. Wider culture seems to have woken up to this hellish lovelessness, seemingly more than the church, as indicated by the popularity of Brené Brown’s studies on love and vulnerability: I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure. With that definition in mind, let’s think about love. Waking up every day and loving someone who may or may not love us back, whose safety we can’t ensure, who may stay in our lives or may leave without a moment’s notice, who may be loyal to the day they die or betray us tomorrow— that’s vulnerability.16 Ahellish existence means we experience a reduced life, which in turn implies that we settle for all sorts of substitutes. And when the substitutes become the norm, we find ourselves living very comfortably, embracing the art of settling.</p>
<p>Human beings are settlers, but not in the pioneer sense. It is our human occupational hazard to settle for little. We settle for purity and piety when we are being invited to an exquisite holiness. We settle for the feardriven when love longs to be our engine. We settle for a puny, vindictive God when we are being nudged always closer to this wildly inclusive, larger-than-any-life God. We allow our sense of God to atrophy.17</p>
<p>Our aptitude for “settling,” and our skillfulness at dodging the transformative dimensions of an encounter with God, have led to a reduction of living that settles for that which is secondary, not that which is primary. We settle not for what is best, but what is okay; not for “first things,” but “second things.”18 Even when Western Christians talk about “life to the full” (John 10:10), we often talk about it in very shallow terms—defining it in terms of safety, security, and prosperity.19 And to the non-believer, this inauthentic optimism we communicate about Jesus bringing us “life to the full” often doesn’t sync with the reality of our lives. It can therefore discredit our testimony, and is one way we actually flatten the story and render it impotent. Life to the full involves both death and life, both crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>The safe, secure, and prosperous life is not the life followers of Jesus have been given and are called to participate in. The overwhelming testimony of the Bible is that people who come into contact with God will Stranded in Grey Town 47 be swept up into a whirlwind of action, excitement, and adventure, as well as the pain, struggle, and suffering that is inevitably part of what it means to follow Jesus. This is known in the New Testament as abiding in Christ, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and discipleship, which, when accurately defined, is about as far from the banality of MTD as one can imagine.</p>
<p>Have we really become, in the words of the author Walker Percy, “the only civilization in history which has enshrined mediocrity as its cultural ideal”?20 And yet, both those who love God and those who deny the existence of God can agree that a life settled on “second things and mediocrity” is one of despair and hopelessness. Areduced and settled life requires no faith because we control everything. It is the exact opposite of “the assurance of things you have hoped for, the absolute conviction that there are realities you’ve never seen” (Hebrews 11:1, The Voice).</p>
<h2>Less Than Ultimate</h2>
<p>Greg Boyd claims that at the source of all that is wrong with humans is a false and ugly (and we would add “reduced”) mental image of God.</p>
<p>This distortion/reduction, he says, lies at the root of the brokenness that originated in the garden—Adam and Eve believed the Serpent’s narrative about God.21 Even though God had only been a generous God who had given them all they would ever need, they accepted the lie that they could have even more if they believed a different story. Of course, the end result was an impoverished and broken life separated from God. Instead of life as it was intended to be, they ended up with a shrunken existence. We all repeat this error on a daily basis. To one degree or another, we have all internalized lies about God that have caused us to mistrust him and therefore to look elsewhere to find life. See how the “domino effect” of these reductions plays out here? Our reduction in the truth of who God is has devastating effects on the way we live out our (reduced) life. Looking at the world through hungry eyes, we, like our primordial parents, have come to see various versions of the forbidden tree as potential sources of life. And here we return to the pervading concern of the Bible... idolatry.</p>
<p>Remember in chapter one we noted that one of the basic urges of idolatry is the human desire to initiate one's own relationship to God, and thereby control him and the way he intersects with our own story. Idolatry is the ancient practice of diminishing and reducing God.22 This is what an idol is. It’s anything we try to use to fill what only God can fill, which means it is anything we use to replace God. The theologian Paul Tillich defines the true evil of idolatry as “as giving oneself to that which is less than ultimate,” allowing the definition of self to come from the finite.23 When anything or anyone becomes the means by which we try to fill our innermost need for unconditional love, unsurpassable worth, and absolute security, it becomes an idol.24 Boyd claims that: There are an endless variety of idols people use to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>Secular Western people today typically try to get life from what they achieve, what they possess, or whom they impress. The misdirected homing device of some leads them to work eighty hours a week, sometimes sacrificing family and friends in the process of climbing the ladder of success to achieve “the American dream.” Others strive to gain the applause of the crowd, performing or achieving their way to fame. And then there are the multitudes that tend to experience the inner void as a gnawing boredom with life. They chase after peak experiences, believing that the next risk-taking adventure, the next experience of falling in love, the next lurid sexual experience, or the next drug-induced high will make them feel fully alive. At best, however, these merely provide a momentary diversion from their emptiness.25 In the Hebrew scriptures, idols and images were forbidden in order to prevent the chosen people trying to fill the space that God wanted left open.</p>
<p>This prohibition was to keep them yearning for a future consummation of God's promises, to keep them expectant, hopeful, and ready, and in relationship with the one, true God. The issue is the same today: we try to diminish the power and presence of God and minimize his impact in our Idolatry both reduces our understanding and experience of God as well as diminishing the quality and meaning of our lives. The Scriptures explicitly warn us about the reducing power of idolatry, saying that we who worship idols become like them … empty and without meaning (Psalm115:8, 135:18; Isaiah 44:9). In a famous commencement speech at Kenyon College, the author David Foster Wallace addressed this very issue: There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship [...] is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things—if they are where you tap real meaning in life—then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship Stranded in Grey Town 49 your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already—it’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power—you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart—you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.27</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans think that a meaningful life can be found by creating and
worshipping our own gods, but in doing so our lives become like the
dwellers of Grey Town—reduced to nothingness.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The False Presence of the Kingdom</h2>
<p>It is the role of those who speak of God, writes Martin Buber, to shatter the false security of idolatry and invite others into an engagement with the sovereign God who demands that his human creatures involve him in all the arenas of life. This “invasive” and demanding presence of the biblical God simply cannot be avoided. It confounds those who imagine they can find some security and comfort in the false certainty an idolatrous religious expression seems to provide. The substitution of religious ritual and formula in place of the foreboding presence of God is what Jacques Ellul calls the false presence of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>We may all go through seasons of apparent comfort or security, protection from, or unawareness of dangers. But eventually, in the life of all believers, there inevitably comes “an hour of awakening,” when a chasm suddenly looms at our feet. It might be doubt or contradiction; it might be an existential challenge, but it calls us to respond in faith, and we find ourselves afraid.28 Our choice is either to continue with the safe life we have so carefully cultivated, with its rules, laws and formulae, or risk a life of dynamic engagement and responsibility. We must choose which of the two will master our lives—a spirit of reduction and security or a spirit of risk and insecurity. It is truly an awesome choice. Buber says that only in such “holy insecurity” can we approach the mystery of God.29 Buber here is reflecting on what the Scriptures mean by living in the fear of God. It is that element of faith that retains a sense of reverence, amazement, and awe; that recognizes we are dealing with a Being that is wholly Other—a Being we can never hope to control. The fear of the Lord places man in that distance of reverence that permits true and unlimited intimacy with God (the mysterium tremendum et fascinans we explored in the previous chapter).30 The Scriptures therefore rightly teach us that this holy fear is the gateway to the love and knowledge of God (Proverbs 1:7, 9).</p>
<p>It is this fear of God that keeps us radically receptive and responsive to God and the possibility that we’re included in his story.31 Whatever tugs against or away from this relationship with God functions as an idol to which we pledge our allegiances. Not only is the Ultimate betrayed, but these idols will only fail in their ability to meet our deepest needs and desires. We must call people into a story that discloses both the power of idols and of God, communicating to them the perils of settling for “less than.” We must no longer bury the Ultimate to get on with our lives as “best we can,” for even when we try to bury God, the ache, longing, and brokenness remain. Our civilized and domesticated life will inevitably only yield a numb resignation, but it can never diminish the overwhelming longing for something more, something we know is out there but we just can’t find.</p>
<h2>A Loss of Wonder</h2>
<p>So much is lost when we resign ourselves to a settled life, including the ability to wonder. An Invitation to enter into a “wonder-less” story will entice very few. No one, Harold Crick included, desires to live a story without wonder, awe, and mystery. “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.”32 It is to a culture with dim eyes that we attempt to engage in a conversation that moves people beyond numb resignation and opens them up to the hope of finding God outside of dogmas and certitudes. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, one of the most significant Jewish theologians of the twentieth century, wrote extensively on wonder and awe throughout his career. A look at the loss of wonder would be incomplete without attempting to understand Heschel’s thoughts on this void in our culture.</p>
<p>The awareness of grandeur and wonder has all but disappeared in the present age. Our educational system stresses the importance of controlling and exploiting reality, of deriving power from knowledge, but there is little education for wonder, for the sublime. We carefully teach children how to measure and weigh and spell, but we fail to teach them how to revere, how to admire, how to appreciate. The sense of wonder Stranded in Grey Town 51 and awe, the sense for the sublime, is such a rare gift; without it the world becomes flat and the human person hollow.33 He proposed that the indifference to wonder is perhaps “the root of all human failings.” We have adopted the belief that everything can or will be explained and that to understand our very existence is simply a matter of aligning principles and theories of reality; for “all enigmas can be solved, and wonder is simply the effect of primordial ignorance. Wonder is thus cast aside.”34 Heschel (as well as Harold Crick) came to the insightful conclusion that a life lived void of awe and wonder, a life that can simply be reduced to having the right answers and doing the right things can be a somewhat tragic life with a proclivity to settle for the mediocre. No one should ever give themselves over to that kind of life. It cannot be the undertaking of any faith in any god to address and provide answers to all our many questions.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be the abundant life Jesus promised. That would be a life steeped in the art of settling; a life with all the answers would have no need for a sense of wonder. And that would be a reduction of truth that leads to a reduction of life, which in the face of imminent death reduces our search for life to the nearest International House of Pancakes.</p>
<h2>The Worst Of All Sins?</h2>
<p>In Aimee Bender’s “The Doctor and the Rabbi”, we are given what amounts to one more caution against living a reduced life in Grey Town. Her short story begins: The doctor went to see the rabbi. “Tell me, rabbi, please,” he said, “about God.” The rabbi pulled out some books. She talked about Jacob wrestling the angel. She talked about Heschel and the kernel of wonder as a seedling that could grow into awe. She tugged at her braid and told a Hasidic story about how it is said that at the end of your life, you will need to apologize to God for the ways you have not lived.</p>
<p>“Not for the usual sins,” she said. “But for the sin of living small.”35</p>
<h2>Section Two: A Longing</h2>
<p>There is so much that has been lost in our unceasing reduction of God, story, and life. Hopefully, in section one, we have clearly stated how a variety of factors have eclipsed our perception of God, and how we have inherited a swathe of profoundly reduced truths that no longer make sense of the complexities we face as we attempt to translate this God into our contexts. As a result of these many reductions we (the church as well as broader culture) are missing a big picture perspective to help us make sense of all the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Our hope in section two is to consider how we have reduced our understanding of what it means to be human in God’s world. It is not only the theological frames that have been narrowed. The frames through which all people are understood (anthropology) are equally reduced. Likewise, the frames through which all people can perceive and experience God are greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Simply stated, all of us suffer a reduced view of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Before we try to provide some viable pathways forward (in sections three and four), we want to take a closer look at aspects of the human condition itself that have been affected by these broader reductions and mostly ignored from all angles, Christian or not. We need to do this for both those we meet on the Camino and at Burning Man as well as for ourselves as individual believers, both existentially and missionally. We need to look again at how all human beings are on a search that involves the deepest aspects of their natures, one that none can avoid, ourselves included. Humans are inherently created for the divine—that much is inescapable—and it is how we go about fulfilling this side of ourselves that makes the difference between meaning and meaninglessness.</p>
