<h1>Chapter 6: The Art of Seeing</h1>
<h2>(A RE-FRAMED VISION OF GOD AND GOSPEL)</h2>

<p>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.</p>

<p>Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning. These six senses increasingly will guide our lives and shape our world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lacking a systematic framework for understanding the clash of forces in today's world, we are like a ship's crew, trapped in a storm and trying to navigate between dangerous reefs without compass or chart. In a culture of warring specialisms, drowned in fragmented data and fine-toothed analysis, synthesis is not merely useful—it is crucial.</p>
<p>—ALVIN TOFFLER
In The Art of Seeing, the influential philosopher and thinker Aldous Huxley</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>recounts how, at the age of sixteen, he “had a violent attack of keratitis
writes, “left me (after eighteen months of near-blindness, during which
one eye just capable of light perception, and the other with enough vision
ten feet.” For the next few years, doctors advised Huxley to read with the
to spectacles—which allowed him “to read tolerably well,” provided that
a particularly heavy patch of opacity at the center of the cornea.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The task of reading caused Huxley considerable strain and fatigue, and when he finally acknowledged that his “capacity to see was steadily and quite rapidly failing,” he discovered a method of teaching oneself to see again called “visual re-education.” Within a few months of attempting this relearning, he was reading without spectacles—and without strain or fatigue. At last, the opacity in the cornea, “which had remained unchanged for upwards of twenty-five years, was beginning to clear up.” Although his vision was far from normal, Huxley had succeeded in teaching himself to see by re-educating his vision, and with a clarity of sight that was “about twice as good as it used to be” when he wore spectacles.2 Huxley’s ability to re-educate his failing vision caused him to question how and why previous ophthalmological treatments had been so unsuccessful. His conclusion was that ophthalmology has “been obsessively preoccupied with only one aspect of the total, complex process of seeing— the physiological. Ophthalmologists have paid attention exclusively to eyes, not at all to the mind which makes use of the eyes to see with.”3 In other words, to perceive and comprehend something requires the engagement of the mind (nous) synthesized with the senses.</p>
<p>Sensing is not the same as perceiving. The eyes and nervous system do the sensing; the mind does the perceiving. Any improvement in the power of perceiving tends to be accompanied by an improvement in the power of sensing. The natural consequence of this is an improvement in seeing—the product of both sensing and perceiving.4 This Huxley calls “the art of seeing,” and it involves adopting an active, disciplined approach to re-educating oneself in order to see/perceive again.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this "art of seeing" is very similar to the psychophysical skills and habits that are typically acquired in early infancy or childhood by a process of mainly unconscious self-instruction. In other words, it is discovering how to see with and through the (humble and enchanted) eyes of a child. Before we can explore this childlike re-education, we first have to break the tyranny of our all-too-adult eyes.</p>
<h2>The Genius of Both/And</h2>
<p>A number of years ago, organization and leadership guru Jim Collins caused something of a revolution in the uber-pragmatic corporate world.</p>
<p>Collins suggested that most of our problems arise when we see the world in increasingly analytical (reduced) formulas and then allow these now reduced ideas to monopolize our thinking. To break out of this “tyranny” and to bring lasting, system-wide change (or to create a “great company”), leaders had to learn to see things much more in terms of wholeness, synthesis, and possibility. We believe he is absolutely right.</p>
<p>Reductionist thinking—what he calls the “Tyranny of the OR”—is the type of analytical rationality that cannot readily accept mystery or paradox, one that is unable to live with two seemingly contradictory ideas at the same time. Under the tyranny of the OR, people believe that things must be either Aor B, but they cannot be both. And because the either/or answer is inevitably a form of reduction, one becomes a victim of his/her own ever-reductive analysis. The net result of this process—to use those perceptive words of William Blake—is that “man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.” Just consider how this either/or way of seeing has played out in our history: theological controversies and denominational splits are always built on ever-reducing understandings of God and the church. (By the way, the very word de-nom-ination means defining ourselves over against others—it is inherently sectarian.) The alternative to reductionist thinking, to use Collins’ term again, is to embrace the “Genius of the AND.” That is, we are to cultivate an ability to embrace multiple possibilities at the same time. Instead of choosing between Aor B, we are to figure out a way to have both Aand B.5 In other words, we resolve our problems not by more analysis but by synthesis. We need to always think bigger … never smaller.6 We must acknowledge that truth is always mysterious and we should allow that mystery to work its magic and provoke us to corresponding awe and wonder. It is this symphonic way of thinking—as we shall see—that connects the dots, opens doors, and cleanses perceptions to enables us to really see again.</p>
<p>Michael Heiser suggests that the Bible, and revelation itself, presents us with something of a theological and literary mosaic. In any mosaic, we gain a perspective that is both broader and deeper only if we allow ourselves to see the various pieces in their own wider context. The pattern in a mosaic often isn’t clear up close, appearing to be just a random assemblage of pieces. Only when you step back can you see the wondrous whole. Sure, the individual pieces are essential; without them there would be no mosaic. But the meaning of all the pieces is found in the completed whole. The picture in the mosaic isn’t imposed on the pieces; it is derived from them.7 It is this skill of perceiving wholeness that has often characterized our greatest thinkers and theologians … people who use godly imagination to enable them to put seemingly disparate things into meaningful relationship in order to form unified wholes.</p>
<p>The “Genius of the AND” is not at all new. In fact Collins simply rediscovered an insight that is latent in universal truth: in order to heal any form of brokenness, whether it is in people or organizations, one has to always attempt to resituate the broken pieces in the context of the whole in order to make sense of it. To heal something one must restore it. There is always renovation in real wholeness. This is why restoration and healing lie at the heart of Jesus’ atoning work in the world.</p>
<p>It is in Jesus, of course, and in the people whose lives have been deeply touched by Jesus, and in ourselves at those moments when we also are deeply touched by him, that we see another way of being human in this world, which is the way of wholeness. When we glimpse that wholeness in others, we recognize it immediately for what it is, and the reason we recognize it, I believe, is that no matter how much the world shatters us to pieces, we carry inside us a vision of wholeness.8 If we wish to avoid the cloying seductions of heresy and reframe our sense of God and the world, we need to allow ourselves to be led by the Spirit in a search to experience the pleroma (the fullness) of God; to pursue a type of wholeness that leads us beyond our settled convictions and toward a wholeness we may have never imagined existed.9 We suggest therefore that the main clue to escaping this heresy of reduction is to recognize that the answer is always bigger than we tend to think it is. Any selective truth must always be evaluated on the basis of its relationship to the totality from which it is derived. The only way back from this broken way of thinking is to be able to reset the “little” truth or belief once again within its “greater” and true ecological context.10 As we explored in chapter one, YHWH cannot be pinned down. He is always much bigger than we tend to think he is. Let us not think either/ or but both/and—it’s truth and goodness and beauty; it’s faith and hope and grace; it’s love and truth and obedience that are needed to know God.</p>
<p>In the second half of this chapter, we will also suggest an application of the “Genius of the AND” to our understanding of the gospel. The good news is forgiveness and reconciliation and adoption into the family, and restoration and mission and... wholeness.</p>
<h2>Pa R A D Oxo Lo G Y</h2>
<p>Certainly one way to engage with reframation is to recognize that in the end, all the most foundational truths of the Christian faith are paradoxical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a paradox, what seems at first to be absurd or self-contradictory, in fact
proves to be true by holding the irreconcilable poles in tension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reductionist thinking is problematic when dealing with living systems, whether they be organizations or people, but it is super-problematic when dealing with the greatest truths or mysteries of the faith, which are always paradoxical in nature—for example, the Trinity (how can God be One and yet be Three?); the Incarnation and the two natures of Christ (how can a man, who is by definition limited, also be God, who is by definition unlimited?); predestination and free will (how can freedom be understood in the context of God’s overwhelming sovereignty?).</p>
<p>All the central, defining truths of the Christian faith only reveal themselves to those with adoring eyes of faith, a love for the sheer in/ comprehensibility of mystery, and a respect for the integrity of paradoxical truth. By invalidating these a priori, either/or thinking inevitably ends in theological heresy, reductionism, and cramped religion.</p>
<p>These truths can only be known by holding diametric aspects to be true—in paradoxical tension. The paradox is the truth … To attempt to resolve it is to lose its dynamic. For instance, consider that we live in two worlds at the same time: one where the past is the cause of all that is present and future (first things/protology), and the other in which the future constructs both the present and the past (last things/eschatology).</p>
<p>You will never understand any of these foundational truths if you cannot learn to live and love both mystery and paradox.</p>
<p>What if the tension between apparently opposing doctrines is exactly where faith comes alive? What if this ancient faith we call Christianity has survived so long not in spite of but precisely because of its apparent contradictions? What if we have settled for neatly packaged, simplistic answers, instead of seeking out the deep and rich realities of our faith?</p>
<p>What if it is in the difficult parts of the Bible that God is most clearly revealed? What if it is in and through our doubts that we learn the meaning of true relationship with the God who created us—of true worship? What if Christianity was never meant to be simple?11 Krish Kandiah’s book Paradoxology makes a bold claim: that the paradoxes that at first sight appear to undermine belief are actually vital to a vibrant faith, and that it is only by continually wrestling with them—rather than trying to pin them down or resolve them one way or another—that we can really worship God, individually and corporately. When paradox is surrendered, then we end up with the unbelieving doubt of a person who cannot permit his or her mind to be blown, or the sloppy sentimentality of liberal ideology and religion, or just the plain old grumpy fundamentalism of conservatives who like things to be black or white.</p>

<p>JUSTWIGGLEYo URSHOULDERSLIKETHIS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I (Alan) was recently in an art gallery exhibiting a number of the twentiethcentury artist Wassily Kandinsky’s paintings. I love Kandinsky’s art because in many of his paintings he claims he was actually trying to paint music, to visualize what he was hearing. Think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>In a recording of an interview with the artist, he advised that, in order to understand his paintings (and in fact all abstract art), one has to take Jesus’ advice to become like children very seriously indeed. One has to look at the paintings with the simple and innocent eyes of a child and, in doing so, re-educate one’s eyes in the art of seeing.12 Children are naturally humble (as well as playful) when it comes to acquiring knowledge; they are always deep in learning mode, always accepting they have more to learn. This is why Jesus says we must change and become like children to be able to enter the kingdom of God (Matthew 18:3–4).</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie, famous for writing Peter Pan in 1904, encouraged adults to see the world through the eyes of the child, and, in doing so, brought about a re-education of sight. The 2004 movie Finding Neverland depicts Barrie bringing Peter Pan to life on the stage of the West End in London.13 Before the premiere, conflict arises as the producer (i. e. “the money” behind the show) is extremely skeptical that the story will appeal to his upper-class theatre patrons.</p>
<p>On opening night, Barrie reserves twenty-five seats, scattered around the theatre, for children from a nearby orphanage. Of course, the children are instantly drawn in to the show, regardless of the elegant surroundings and the stodgy theatre goers on either side of them. As the appropriate amount of pixie dust is sprinkled on the actors, and as the instructions are given to “just wiggle your shoulders like this and let go,” even the most curmudgeonly of adults, when seated next to a child, begin to see with new eyes, and so enter into the world of Neverland.</p>
<p>The obvious question for each of us to consider is, can we approach God with a similar innocence and joy? For it will be the playful, unprejudiced, humble, and curious who will be able to make sense of the God who is beyond our wildest imagination, and who will begin to pursue wholeness in ways that bring about meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>It was the childlike eyes of the early church Fathers and Mothers that meant they were able to plumb the depths of beauty, goodness, and truth of God in the way that they did. Like children, they had unprejudiced, humble, and curious eyes of wonder.14 And this childlike reverence and awe is a prerequisite for grasping mysterious truth. The quantum physicist Max Planck eulogizes childlike thinking in contributing to advances in the area of science: The feeling of wonderment is the source and inexhaustible fountainhead of [the child’s] desire for knowledge. It drives the child irresistibly on to solve the mystery, and if in his attempt he encounters a causal relationship, he will not tire of repeating the same experiment ten times, a hundred times, in order to taste the thrill of discovery over and over again. The reason why the adult no longer wonders is not because he has solved the riddle of life, but because he has grown accustomed to the laws governing his world picture […] He who does not comprehend this situation, misconstrues its profound significance, and he who has reached the stage where he no longer wonders about anything, merely demonstrates that he has lost the art of reflective reasoning.15 As we noted in chapter two, God is both above and beyond all things (transcendent), and yet as Creator he is also within all things (immanent).</p>
<p>We therefore need to widen the doors of our perception in an attempt to take it all in. In doing so, we are able to discern the presence of God in everything that he has made. We will thereby discover that “the whole universe is a cosmic Burning Bush filled with the divine Fire yet not consumed.”16 Or, as poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning noted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earth’s crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God;
But only he who sees, takes off his shoes,
The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries,</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Blake hints that a way forward is:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold I nfinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour18
to be everywhere … infinite. It’s all in the seeing! William Blake (echoing
some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands
To live in God’s world is to have a willingness to see and experience the
our primary vision.20 Episcopalian priest Barbara Brown Taylor recounts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could no longer see myself or the least detail of my life in the same way again. When the service was over that day I walked out of it into a Godenchanted world, where I could not wait to find further clues to heaven on earth. Every leaf, every ant, every shiny rock called out to me—begging to be watched, to be listened to, to be handled and examined. I became a detective of divinity, collecting evidence of God’s genius and admiring the tracks left for me to follow: locusts shedding their hard bodies for soft, new, winged ones; prickly pods of milkweed spilling silky white hair; lightning spinning webs of cold fire in the sky, as intricate as the veins in my own wrist. My friend taught me to believe that these were all words in the language of God, hieroglyphs given to puzzle and I could no longer see myself or the least detail of my life in the same way again.21 Ben (a friend of Alan’s) once had a teaching role where he had to play a mad scientist in order to introduce kindergarten children to the wonders of science. At one point he was trying to explain to a group of children how magnets worked. One child kept saying that Ben was all wrong, insisting instead that they worked by “magic.” Ben again attempted to explain the scientific nature of magnetic fields and their intricacies, to which the young girl responded, “Yeah, that’s magic!” Ben had to agree. Sometimes you just have to wiggle your shoulders like this and let go...</p>

<p>ALway SYEARNING, ALway SLEARNING</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his 1952 groundbreaking book, Your God Is Too Small, J. B. Phillips calls on Christians to reframe their understanding of God by embarking on a personal search for a more meaningful concept of him.22 Phillips felt then, as we do now: the trouble facing us today is that we do not have a god big enough to help us make any real sense of our world, a world where our experience of life has grown in myriad directions and our mental horizons have been expanded to the point of utter bewilderment by world events and scientific discoveries. Our inherited maps no longer fit the territories. In fact, although we live in this incredibly complex, ever-evolving world, our ideas of God have remained largely static and formulaic for many centuries.</p>
<p>Phillips wrote from a deep conviction that if it is really true—that there is a God who is in charge of the whole cosmos, of human history, as well as the mysteries of life and death—then we can hardly escape a sense of futility and frustration until we begin to see what he is like and what his purposes are. We all need to expand our vision of who God is.</p>
<p>The very fact that it is God with whom we engage means that we should always expect to be expanded while being reframed—in other words it means that we should expect to have our minds blown every time. Consider the inconceivable size and scale of the universe itself; then consider that the Being we call “God” is the Being who created this infinite space with words.</p>
<p>He spoke everything into existence … from nothing to something … just like that! How do you get your mind around that?!</p>
<p>If we were to similarly recast God’s love and grace in a wi-l]der frame, then consider how, in the Incarnation, the eternal, all-knowing, mindblowing God emptied himself and entered fully into the very limited human experience of a servant, enduring the depths of darkness and sin on our behalf in and through the cross (Philippians 2). We must ask ourselves, why would this Eternal Being do this for me/us? And the only possible answer to this is … inconceivable love and grace, the kind which, once again, blows any normal sense of ratio and scale that we might possess. This is the grace of God in a wi-l]der frame.</p>
<p>Consider Nicodemus in John 3. He seemed to be similarly overwhelmed during his interactions with Jesus, late one evening in the dark of night. “How can this be?” he responds, when Jesus tells him he must be born again if he is to see the kingdom of God. Perhaps Nicodemus was beginning to realize that the very small world he had been inhabiting was not the reality he had always believed it was. Jesus was blowing the doors off his small-minded religious tendency to tweak a few laws here and there, and instead was calling him to new birth. Any encounter with Jesus requires the same. Any time we truly contemplate who Jesus is must surely blow our minds. His call to us is always to more. To a bigger God. Abigger story. Abigger life. It really doesn’t matter if all this feels somewhat overwhelming. Actually, the point is that one ought to feel overwhelmed when dealing with the Infinite and the Eternal.23 The unquenchable sense of yearning for God does not come to a halt even at the end of all things, when all creatures are brought face-to-face with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God. Genuine longing can never tire of looking at the beloved. Augustine
uses the term “insatiable satisfaction” to express this “ever-moreness.”24
In seeing the Face that surpasses all desire, “we will be insatiably satisfied,
filled.”25 “We will have attuned the ear for that Voice,” which, once heard,
When God sends his own living Word to his creatures, he does so not to
their deepest needs and yearnings. Rather he communicates and actively
awestruck by a love which he could never have hoped to experience.27</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Learn More, Understand Less</h2>
<p>One of the things we lament in contemporary expressions of Christianity is that we have failed to really inculcate a love of learning, a culture of deep and searching theology, especially one that rests comfortably in the ineffable mysteries of God. Where in our faith communities are we providing opportunities for this to happen, alongside each other? Where are we allowing the "Jacobs" in our churches to cross the Jabbok River and wrestle their faith out with God? Where does one come across groups like the Inklings (those who regularly share their creative works with one another) in the typical church? It seems we prefer our truths to be laid out in three-point sermons addressing the most recent “felt need,” delivered in an entertaining monologue, with no room for dialogue at an elementary level. We are still existing on milk when we should be eloquent in truth, as the New Testament writers lament.28 How do we account for that?</p>
<p>The call we are making is a call to learn. Acall to feed yourself and then feed others. Stop chewing on tofu-flavored theological bubblegum; read the greats, the very best in the field. And read beyond your narrow traditions.</p>
<p>Read books, listen to podcasts, anything that forces you to think for yourself. Stop complaining about the big words; it is really worth learning what “the greats” have to say; get a dictionary, learn their language if you have to. Learn together in community, and not just a community filled with people like you—find others, from different environments, backgrounds, ethnicities, experiences, and perspectives, and create communities where all might be re-educated in seeing again. David Bentley Hart, himself one of our great contemporary theologians, writes: Wisdom is the recovery of innocence at the far end of experience; it is the ability to see again what most of us have forgotten how to see […] God is not only the ultimate reality that the intellect and the will seek but is also the primordial reality with which all of us are always engaged in every moment of existence and consciousness, apart from which we have no experience of anything whatsoever. Or, to borrow the language of Augustine, God is not only superior summo meo—beyond my utmost heights—but also Interior intimo meo—more inward to me than my inmost depths. Only when one understands what such a claim means does one know what the word “God” really means.29</p>
<h2>From a One-Dimensional to a Three-Dimensional Gospel</h2>
<p>Re-educating our vision and practicing the art of seeing not only applies to our understanding of God, but is relevant to our understanding of the gospel as well. Our severely diminished and reduced explanations of the good news similarly need reframing.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment the questions universal to a search for God (whether the search is intentional or not). Questions at the core of existence for all humanity include: Who am I and how is my identity formed and defined?</p>
<p>Where do I find a sense of justice in a broken world?</p>
<p>How do I find a people to belong to, to be with?</p>
<p>How do I approach work, calling, and purpose?</p>
<p>What do I do with my sadness, brokenness, and sin?</p>
<p>Who is worth following and where should my allegiance lie?</p>
<p>It is important for us to wrestle with how the answers to these questions inform and form a culture’s response to God and Jesus. We so often miss how different contexts and cultural narratives determine how this good news is received. For there are largely three ways in which these questions are approached and their answers are subsequently found:30</p>
<h2>The Western Frame</h2>
<p>A Western approach to the gospel is one that is founded in “true and false,” “right and wrong,” and “guilt and innocence” (much of what we described earlier in chapter one). Such views tend toward the “forensic” and “clinical.” The emphasis is consistently on the individual and the “personal” nature of salvation, and is crafted into a logical argument to explain who fits into which category (guilty or innocent) and what remedy is needed to save souls (what transaction needs to occur to rescue them).</p>
<p>We may say in general that in Western Christianity, especially Protestantism (remember Luther’s panic attacks), salvation is understood primarily in terms of real, objective human guilt of sin before a holy and righteous God who cannot abide sin. Salvation is therefore viewed through the metaphor of legal standing before holy God. Guilty human beings are made or declared righteous by God on the basis of the work of substitutionary atonement in the cross of Jesus. This is known as forensic or imputed righteousness, whereby sinful humans are entirely dependent on the grace of God and the forgiveness of sin that comes through the shed blood of Jesus.</p>
<p>This Western Christian worldview is reflected in the way most Western Christians proclaim the gospel, focusing on how God forgives our sins on the basis of Christ’s atonement, in which the I nnocent pays for the guilty and releases them from guilt and sin. Think of the Four Spiritual Laws, the Two Ways and other similar tracts.</p>
<p>And just to once again be clear here, we do believe that forgiveness of real sin and guilt is a critical dimension of good news. The problem, as in all reductionism, is what is missing. Taken in isolation from the other dimensions of the gospel, assuming one cultural perspective, Westerners end up with what the theologian Dallas Willard called a reduced “gospel of sin-management” and then, like Procrustes (he of chapter one), everything else is subsequently forced to fit.31</p>
<h2>The Eastern Frame</h2>
<p>In contrast to a predominantly Western approach, an Eastern way of understanding the good news has tended to experience and comprehend the world not through the lenses of guilt/innocence or right/wrong but rather through honor/shame, grace/disgrace. In an honor/shame culture, the primary perceived consequence of sin is dishonor, loss of face or esteem, a relational distancing or being shunned, and an experience of disgrace. “Shame is the fear, pain, or state of being regarded unworthy of acceptance in social relationships.”32 The concept of honor/shame has been called “the pivotal cultural value” of the Bible.33 Beginning from Genesis 1, honor and shame run through the entire story of the Bible. “The term guilt and its various derivatives occur 145 times in the Old Testament and 10 times in the New Testament, whereas the term shame and its derivatives occur nearly 300 times in the Old Testament and 45 times in the New Testament.” Yet leading theology books continue to emphasize guilt and courtroom motifs over shame and community motifs.34 Furthermore, it is important for Western Christians to realize that honor and shame is the “operating system for 65% of the world and 80% of the unreached.”35 The majority of people therefore don’t experience the world through the familiar Western registers of the gospel.</p>
<p>Because many confuse guilt with shame, it is worth highlighting how they differ: guilt is usually tied to some event or action: I did something bad.</p>
<p>Objective guilt (different to subjective Freudian “guilt feelings”) happens when a person infringes a rule or law, for example in committing a crime, or, theologically, in sinning against God’s holiness. In doing so, a person becomes objectively guilty. Alternatively, shame is tied to a person and to relationships: I am bad. It is largely experienced as an internal or subjective register … a hemorrhaging of the soul. Shame is a feeling of not measuring up, which in turn creates an inner sense of unworthiness, reproach, dishonor, humiliation, and disgrace—a constant feeling of falling short of what one thinks is expected. Guilt is about what I’ve done. Shame is about who I am.36 Guilt is normally limited to individual actions. Shame is more social and contagious.</p>
<p>No one can share in your guilt, but many can share in your shame. The child whose father is imprisoned, the wife whose husband is unfaithful, the daughter whose mother is abusive—they all share the shame. They feel their self-worth is lessened. Shame wraps its arms around their ankles tightly, allowing them to walk but never to run. Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.</p>
<p>In this way, shame is far less logical than guilt. Guilt is connected to events that can be defined in objective forensic categories: who, what, where, when, and why. But shame is far less concerned with details.37 And so, for example, in a guilt culture, God’s power is about “forgiveness of transgressors,” whereas in a shame culture, God honors the lowly and humbles the proud. In a guilt culture, God’s righteousness is about providing justice; in a shame culture, God’s righteousness is about maintaining covenant faithfulness.38 The question that scholars of honor/ shame are asking is whether those with a Western mindset will ever be able to view the Scriptures through any lenses other than their own. “We assume that our own historical theology is comprehensive and flawless, without recognizing that it too has been contextualized within our own Western culture.”39 The result is a disregarded and ignored theology of honor/shame, with volumes written on guilt/innocence. (Again, this is not an argument “for or against” either of these perspectives, but rather a plea to see our blind spots, and to appreciate just how much our interpretation of Scripture, and therefore the message we convey to others, is culturally biased. We must learn to embrace both/and.) We should be embarrassed at our ignorance, arrogance, and unwillingness to understand the gospel outside our Western paradigm/nous.</p>
<h2>The Southern Frame</h2>
<p>In addition to the Western and the Eastern way of gospel thinking, we must also appreciate the worldview held in the Southern hemisphere, especially perhaps Africa and South America. Southerners, who are traditionally very open to the spiritual dimension of life, have tended to experience the world through the lenses of power and powerlessness, fear and freedom from it, possession and dispossession, bondage and freedom. Aproclamation of the gospel that disregards these issues will therefore carry very little impact in a Southern cultural context. In order for us to widen our lens of the gospel, we need to have a greater understanding of how it is being heard. In order to resonate in the hearts of the southern peoples, the gospel must include a way to deal with, and explain, the dark motives of so many would-be leaders (the so-called “tin-pot dictators”) and the willingness of people to be so readily enslaved by them. The gospel narrative must therefore intersect with both politics and community. How does the good news free people from bondage to such powers? What does it mean to live a life free from poverty, enslavement, and fear? How does the Lordship of Jesus fundamentally change the equation of power?</p>
<p>Another important aspect of majority Southern cultures is the awareness of the supernatural and thus also of fallen spiritual powers and their role in binding humans up; spiritual warfare is understood as part of life. African Christianity in particular sits within a much more enchanted view of the world, one which Westerners (who live in the demystified and demythologized worldview) must learn from. Westerners can also learn from the Southern perspective how the work of Jesus annuls the oppression of the principalities and powers that dominate a fallen world (e. g., Romans 8:37–39; Ephesians 1:21; 3:10–11; Colossians 1:16; 2:14–15).</p>
<h2>The "Glocal" Gospel</h2>
<p>Hopefully it’s clear that each of these different contexts necessitates a different appropriation of the gospel. Dimensions of the gospel that address our guilt must not be misappropriated and force-fitted to somehow address a sense of shame or to still our fears. Forgiveness is needed for guilt; unconditional love and acceptance is needed to address issues of shame; and the idea of redemption or rescue is needed for those needing liberation from enslaving powers.</p>
<p>Missionaries have known this, and have adopted these different approaches for decades. What is becoming evident is that in our globalized culture, all these issues can now be readily identified throughout the West.</p>
<p>People in your everyday context, people on the Playa or the Camino, now commonly experience and express existential issues that register in all three dimensions. This is not a new or different version of good news; rather, it’s recognizing the multi-faceted nature of the gospel and acknowledging our limited and reduced understanding of it. If we are truly to consider what is “good news” to those around us, it’s essential we embrace a larger understanding. We have to expand our proclamation of the gospel to suit, not make it smaller.</p>
<p>We live in a “glocal” world, characterized by both local and global considerations, and accordingly we need to embrace a “glocal gospel.” Missiologists now believe that the overlap of these three dominant ways of understanding the gospel is increasing.40 There is no longer a distinct separation of one from another, and those commonalities of good news perspectives, the middle part of the chart below, are only going to continue to grow.</p>
<h2>Western Frame Eastern Frame</h2>
<h2>(GUILT) (SHAME)</h2>
<p>True/False Honor/Shame Right/Wrong Grace/Disgrace Individual-I deological Communal-Relational Global Frame 3-D</p>
<h2>Southern Frame (FEAR)</h2>
<p>Power/Powerlessness Fear/Freedom from Fear Political-Communal For instance, the issue of shame is permeating more than ever into a Western context. This shame and dishonor occurs through multiple contributing factors.</p>
<p>Consider the fact that America is an extremely competitive culture: from childhood playgrounds, to sport, to stock markets, gambling, business deals, and the pursuit of fame, everything is built upon the idea of winning.</p>
<p>To be sure, this has created a high-achieving culture where people strive to be better than the next person. However, the problem with a competitive culture is that by celebrating the achievement of the celebrity-winner, the culture produces a whole lot of people who are considered “losers” by comparison. And it is here that people are shamed, because with losing comes the shame of not winning.</p>
<p>Another very significant example comes from the idealized celebritybeauty: by idealizing what it means to be “beautiful,” and in giving that beauty disproportionate worth, we create by implication a standard of ugliness by which everyone else is measured—let’s face it, we are all “ugly” (read unacceptable) by comparison. This beauty myth contributes to a culture of honor and shame.</p>
<p>Rather than judging the drivenness and competitiveness evident throughout American culture, we would do well to consider that it might simply be symptomatic of the real human need to feel significant, to stand out, to be recognized. The forgiveness of sins (addressing objective guilt for having violated a standard) simply does not address the experience of shame. It’s not meant to. God’s love, grace, and acceptance do. The gospel here must rather proclaim that there is nothing anyone can do to increase how much God eternally loves each and every individual, regardless of strength or beauty, winning or losing. No one needs to prove themselves before this God. It is this God who also restores personal dignity by giving believers a new status and identity. The Scriptures constantly tell us that God opposes the proud (another major register of honor/shame) and raises up the downcast. He eternally “sees” us (foresight and election), and in choosing us he honors each one of us with a new identity as a fully legitimate member of his family. God has dealt with the roots of all shame and dishonor. God is the waiting Father who runs to the returning son, who embraces the one who has squandered everything and so dishonored the family name. This speaks volumes in an honor/shame culture in which fathers must always retain face and respect … They do not run to greet people, let alone toward sons who have shamed the family.41 In terms of the register of power/powerlessness, in the West we have recently experienced mass social movements that are birthed from a sense of powerlessness. Take for instance Black Lives Matter. Those involved in this movement are communicating real experiences of real people who feel utterly powerless to change their destiny. This powerlessness was birthed out of the wrongful appropriation of their ancestors as slaves in what was later to become the United States of America. Because this is an issue of power, a more effective way to connect the gospel with those who have been affected by these issues is often through the gospel of liberation from slavery and oppression. This is why the Exodus narrative resonates in most civil rights movements. God is a Redeemer; he sets the captive free; he creates a community based on justice, equity, and the dignity of all concerned.</p>
<p>He defeats and humiliates the powers and principalities that oppress and demean them. Once again, God’s forgiveness of personal sins, although necessary in the healing of the human soul, will not address the problems raised by the forceful misuse of power. The #Me Too movement is likewise motivated by power/powerlessness motifs (as well as shame/dishonor) in its opposition to sexual harassment and assault of women.</p>
<p>And in terms of universal human guilt and culpability, God in his mercy declares the believer as righteous through the death of Christ on our behalf, thereby establishing a right relationship and ongoing access to God without fear of judgment. He forgives us our all too real sins in response to the fact that we are objectively guilty before God (we have all fallen short).</p>
<p>God requires that we too learn to forgive others in response to our selfrighteousness and judgmentalism.42 The integration of all three dimensions is required to bring a more comprehensive proclamation that addresses the different existential issues raised by all three major orientations. We must simply overcome the Western assumption that the legal framework of the gospel is the only biblical framework of salvation.43 Salvation extends beyond our need for forgiveness to include our need for unconditional love, liberation from bondage, raising up the outcast and brokenhearted, and so much more. All three frameworks of the gospel are now current in every Western context.</p>
<p>We need a whole lot more of both/and, and less of the either/or, in our register of the gospel. We need it bigger, not smaller! Agospel that can heal every human ill.</p>
<p>Areframed and expanded gospel never stops addressing our guilt, shame, and fear. But human beings experience an even broader range of existential and religious issues that arise from sin and brokenness: these symptomatic issues include depression, despair, loneliness, isolation, anger, immaturity, and rootlessness. They originate from the denial of death, meaninglessness, anxiety, alienation, unhappiness, etc. and these too are effectively dealt with by God. And so we can see that the gospel tackles our root issues…</p>
<ul>
<li>Human loneliness is addressed by us being placed by the Spirit into God's covenant family, a family built on love, grace, and acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We really belong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our deepest regrets are transformed by the God who redeems and</li>
</ul>
<p>repurposes the broken elements of our lives. Nothing is lost in God's economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Afalse or fragmented identity is healed by the gift of knowing who</li>
</ul>
<p>we truly are in Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ameaningless life overcome with boredom and despair is</li>
</ul>
<p>reinvigorated by being commissioned into a movement that is destined to change a broken and hurting world.</p>
<ul>
<li>The human capacity to be enslaved through addiction and</li>
</ul>
<p>misdirected passion is addressed by freedom in discipleship and the power of the Holy Spirit. Our once misdirected desires find their fulfillment and completion in God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of death is annulled through being granted eternal life that is</li>
</ul>
<p>experienced both here and now and forever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asense of lostness is dealt with by being "found" … God sees us,</li>
</ul>
<p>pursues us, saves us. He is relentless.</p>

<h2>So Many More Rooms</h2>
<p>In 5Q, which exposes disastrous reductions in ministry, I (Alan) wrote that in order to learn and grow in God, we will first need to unlearn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the desire, as well as the ability, to see things in their original
wholeness exacts a price on those who find themselves captive to
reductionisms of various sorts and varieties. The price of admission to
repentance is the price required for any new learning in any domain—
church it’s called repentance. No one can learn who is not first prepared
repent regularly.44
and it changes everything. It re/frames how you see and experience God,
of real metanoia, you don’t just look out at reality; you look out from
you are in God and God is in you. “After his conversion experience, Paul
than me.’”45 In fact, Paul uses the phrase “in Christ” around 160 times
one-liner of all to describe himself after conversion: “Ino longer live, but
a transformed person!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a completely different experience of life. I don’t have to fully write my private story. It’s being written with me and in me. I am already a character on the stage. I am being used, I am being chosen, I am being led. You will know that after conversion. You will know that your life is not about you […] You are about God.46</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adjusting your view to make room for a bigger picture of reality, and
repenting of reductionisms, like all true encounters with God, will require
change. To be able to learn something new, whether it is related to God or
obsolete ideas and open our eyes and our hearts to being willing to grow,
into the unknown, and not allow their heart and head to be stunted by
suggest that new breakthroughs are only gained by those who break out
why they are called breakthroughs.47
from settling in a one-dimensional perspective, we are wise to pay attention
God’s will is mystery and remains so as well. God introduces us into this
cannot be exhausted by being revealed; just as in God the unveiling of
directions, and at the same time to be drawn into God’s mystery is a

Have we fallen into the trap of seeing God one-dimensionally—as if</p>

<p>There is so much more to God. There is so much left to explore.</p>
<p>To be able to think of God and the world in a much more expansive and “roomier” way should bring some movement and reshaping to our own lives. Beginning to accept the idea that there are more rooms than those we alone know allows us to consider the need to repent of our oneroom narrative. For it is in this turning away from a limited view, in the re-education of our vision, that we realize we need to unlearn all of what we have imagined we knew of God, and experience the struggle to believe and see afresh and anew. When we dare to keep nothing assumed or selfdevised, we are plunged, sometimes in great fear and trembling, through a door we have never had the courage to open and into a room we had never imagined existed.</p>
