<h2>— WILLIAM BLAKE</h2>
<p>There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, Mine!</p>
<h2>— ABRAHAM KUYPER</h2>
<p>The nineteenth-century poet and painter William Blake considered it his life’s purpose to awaken people to the divine aspects of their own natures.</p>
<p>A genuine eccentric who performed his particular art out of a deep reverence for Scripture, Blake used poetry and bizarre paintings to break through dull familiarity, evoke imagination, and provoke response. In his epic poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in which he explores the spiritual interconnectivity of all things, he writes: If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.1 This little line of poetry provides us with a major key to understanding the themes of this book. Becoming aware of the spiritual blindness in ourselves and in the people and society around us would be a major move toward a reframation. As we’ve already explored, human beings are wired for eternity (the humming of unseen harps), but in order to discern the source of humming and to be able respond to it, human perception needs to be “cleansed.” Allow the sheer power of Blake’s images to impact your perspective on reality and imagination—“doors of perception,” “cleansed,” “closed,” “narrow chinks,” and “cavern.” Blake here pictures people—people very much like you and me—as living rather fearfully in a prison-like cavity in the side of a mountain. There, as they press themselves ever further into the back of the cave, the opening appears to them as an ever-diminishing slit of light. Through this narrow opening they get only highly filtered glimpses of what they perceive as the overwhelming and threatening world outside the cave. And yes, while it might well be dank, dark, and confined inside the cave … to them, at least, it seems safe and controllable. But in this restricted, “dungeoned” existence, the inmates’ own perceptions are darkened and reality cannot be viewed as it truly is.</p>
<p>We ask the reader to somehow try to imagine what it is like to form one’s perspectives of the world from a life spent within a very limited space.</p>
<p>Consider one of C. S. Lewis’ parables, in which he invites us to picture a woman thrown into a dungeon. In that prison, she bears and rears a son.</p>
<p>The poor lad grows up seeing nothing but dungeon walls, straw on the floor, and a grating, which is too high up to show anything except a little patch of sky. It turns out that this unfortunate woman was also an artist, and when they imprisoned her, she was allowed to bring with her a drawing pad and a box of pencils. Because she never loses the hope of freedom, she constantly tries to help her son understand something of the outer world, which he has never seen. As he has no reference to objects outside the dungeon, she tries to teach him by drawing him pictures. With the lines of her pencil she attempts to communicate to him what fields, rivers, mountains, cities, and waves on a beach are like. He is a devoted learner, and he does his best to believe her when she tells him that the outer world is way more interesting and glorious than anything in the dungeon. At times, he succeeds in believing this. At times, he simply cannot believe because he Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 71 cannot conceive what she is really referring to. In one such event, when his imagination fails him and he confesses utter disbelief, the mother realizes that all these years he has lived under a misconception.</p>
<p>“But,” she gasps, “you didn’t think that the real world was full of lines drawn in lead pencil?” “What?” says the boy. “You mean that there are no pencil marks there?” And instantly, his whole notion of the outer world becomes an utter blank. For the lines, by which alone he was imagining it, have now been denied of it. He has no idea of that which will exclude and dispense with the lines, that of which the lines were merely a transposition—the waving treetops, the light dancing on the weir, the colored three-dimensional realities which are not enclosed in lines but define their own shapes at every moment with a delicacy and multiplicity which no drawing could ever achieve. The child will get the idea that the real world is somehow less visible than his mother’s pictures. In reality it lacks lines because it is incomparably more visible.2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the boy’s points of reference (the dungeon) fail to help him perceive
a reality outside this limited world. Remember, this is what Blake is
addressing—perceptions, not reality. The actual results of a cave-like

of knowledge, how we perceive, interpret, and make sense of the world—
reduced, but that our very way of receiving and perceiving the truth is</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A System Of Hideouts</h2>
<p>Apart from providing shelter for prehistoric cavemen and a few random monks, caves have generally not been considered as places to live, but rather as places to hide. In the Scriptures, caves are used for concealment, for staying out of sight, and as hideaways. Metaphorically and theologically understood, therefore, the cave can be seen as the place where the Adam in all of us, the first of all of us, hides from God.3 Afraid of the piercing light of God’s presence, we prefer, as God’s first creation did, secretive darkness instead.</p>
<p>Adam hides himself to avoid rendering accounts, to escape responsibility for his way of living. Every man hides for this purpose, for every man is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam and finds himself in Adam’s situation. To escape responsibility for
his life, he turns existence into a system of hideouts.4
In the Rabbinic tradition, Adam’s decision to eat the fruit was far less
representative of a world that attempts to deny the existence of a God who
lies at the root of rebellion and irresponsibility. “When this habit of hiding
hideout the person’s situation becomes more and more questionable every
safety, and begins to populate the theatre of the world with figments of

</blockquote>
<p>In his compassion, God continues to ask, “Where are you?” That question—addressed to Adam and to us—is designed to awaken the person to responsibility and to lure them out of their respective system of hideouts.</p>
<p>When we hear that question, and when we shed our alibis and try to respond, then the wall built by our callousness begins to crumble away. God is never distant from the honest and repentant heart, for the biblical God is not essentially a hidden God, but one who is always revealing himself.7</p>
<h2>The Disenchanted Paradigm</h2>
<p>As we consider what it means to be human, we’d do well to note that in the New Testament, the word mind (nous, dianoia) constitutes “not an instrument of thought” but “a mode of thought” or “mind-set.” It therefore refers to the outlook, filter, orientation, or frames, as well as the rationale implicit in these. There are similarities here to the cultural imprint ideas Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 73 we explored in chapter four, but excavating the idea of “mind-set” takes us even deeper toward understanding the spiritual depth of imprints. This mind-set is “a complex of thoughts and assumptions which make up the consciousness of a person” or their “way of thinking.”8 For instance, Paul talks about the “cravings of our flesh” in Ephesians 2:3 as a way of talking about a darkened perception, and in Romans 12:2 he talks about having one’s perception cleansed, “renewing the nous.” To translate nous/dianoia as simply “mind” therefore does not fully convey the full biblical understanding. Rather, it approximates what we might generally call a worldview or paradigm; a particular set of frames used to view the world. And while paradigms allow us to see the world and negotiate it, they also come along with what is called “paradigmblindness.” By opting for one view of reality, the perceiver automatically deselects possible alternatives.9 It is this that either allows us to see—or blinds us to—what is really there.</p>
<p>And so perhaps the most truly terrifying thing about living in a darkened cave is the paradigm—the “cave-rationality” by which it operates—the mind-set that is now suitably adjusted to the reduced reality of the hideout.</p>
<p>The narrowed and darkened confines of the cave become the very definition of what is to be considered normal.10 Those on the inside don’t even notice, as they have simply inherited a way of seeing things and use the same rationality to escape their own existential culpability before God. We are once again reminded of Lewis’ image of hell in The Great Divorce (the name of which, incidentally, is a direct riff off the title of Blake’s poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell). However, now we discover that the problem is rooted in human consciousness itself. As we noted in chapter three, C. S. Lewis claims that, “Hell is a state of mind” and warns that, “every state of mind, left to itself, every shutting up of the creature within the dungeon of its own mind—is, in the end, Hell.”11 This “darkening of the nous,” might best be described as disenchantment, a darkness that has come about from a refusal to see and acknowledge this living and active God. Such disenchantment of the mind (the nous) is even more dangerous than outright revolt. In becoming disenchanted, an individual effectively silences the only inner voice that can keep their heart lively and alert as they grow older. They have stifled the voice of the child they once were. It was Jesus who said that it is only through the simple eyes of the child, the eyes that see the world through the ever-expanding frames of wonder, surprise, and imagination, that one can understand God.12 “Disenchantment therefore is as full and dense as hell itself. In this icy place, all fire from above has been extinguished. The only person who can be disenchanted is the one who has not grasped that the world is a dark marvel. Disenchantment is a sign of stupidity.”13 It is “stupidity” here because, in claiming to be wise, the disenchanted have proven themselves to be fools in the most fundamental sense of the word (Romans 1:22).</p>
<p>Disenchantment is therefore a characteristic of the darkened prison in which all deniers of God inevitably find themselves.14 It is therefore the nous—the paradigm or door of perception—that needs to be cleansed, reoriented and reimagined so that a sense of re/ enchantment might prevail. And according to Paul it is this disenchantment that the gospel of Jesus addresses by restoring a right relationship with God (Romans 3–4), reconstituting a new humanity (Romans 5), uniting us with Christ, reorienting our lives around Jesus (Romans 6), bestowing his Spirit to lead and enlighten us (Romans 8), and granting us a new nousparadigm (Romans 12) through which we can attune ourselves to God and his purposes. God has overcome our brokenness and rebellion, has cleansed our perceptions, and has enlightened us with a comprehensive vision of reality that includes his eternal purposes for his entire cosmos (Colossians and Ephesians). Hardly a vision of the world from the confines of a cave.15 Seeing Is Believing And Believing Is Seeing “To see what is in front of one’s nose requires a constant struggle” (George Orwell).16 The story is told that when Columbus first arrived in what was to become known as the Caribbean in 1492, the indigenous people on the shore could not see Columbus’ large ships sitting on the horizon. The reason for this was that the idea of “ships” was beyond their conceptual experience, beyond their knowledge, and therefore beyond their perceived realm of possibility. They could not see what was right in front of them.17 It should be obvious simply from any experience of looking for something that was under your nose all along … Things can hide in plain sight. 18 Even when something might be right in front of us, if we do not have the proper mental slots or receptors to process what we are seeing, we fail to see at all.</p>
<p>Limited perceptual categories mean that people will often not “see” what is directly in front of them. Eugene Webb warns that it requires great effort for a philosopher, a psychologist, or a scientist to grasp what is lacking in their own respective spheres of expertise; they are so trained in a certain way of thinking, it is almost impossible to “see” the gaps.</p>
<p>Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 75 We’ve all experienced this when we have been so preoccupied with one thing that we fail to see something else right in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>(Smartphone-obsessed pedestrians dawdling along the bike path, this means you.) We tend to see only what can be incorporated into our entrenched frame of reference, our already established frame, and to reject anything that doesn’t “fit.” We de/select those aspects of reality that confront our assumptions about the world and make us uncomfortable. We can only see what we believe to be possible.19 This is a warning to us all.</p>
<p>In his book Simply Good News, N. T. Wright points out that Jesus had similar problems in proclaiming good news to his hearers; there were plenty of people who couldn’t see or receive his message because it was not what they expected or what they had been trained to see. “Jesus’s contemporaries—even his Jewish ones, and how much more his nonJewish ones!—had their heads and hearts full of wrong ideas, and he constantly ran the risk that they would hear what he was saying within the context of those wrong ideas and so twist it completely out of shape.” In fact this is a problem that runs throughout history. Jesus’ message to his contemporaries, and the church’s subsequent message about Jesus, never seems to fit what people expect. Often enough, it doesn’t even fit what the church itself expects. The good news seems to baffle its hearers because it is never what people think it ought to be. For some people, it’s so different (they were not expecting Warhead Candy) they can’t even begin to recognize it. That is why, as Paul said, the gospel is the power of God to some and foolishness to others.20 Some perceive the message as threatening and therefore become fearful of it or try to stamp it out. Wright goes on to say: How we understand things is a function of our whole personality. But if that whole personality is significantly flawed in some way—and sadly, that seems to be the case with all of us—this will affect the mental framework with which we start. It isn’t, in other words, that we are flawed human beings in other respects but our minds are clear and fully operational, just waiting like a blank sheet of paper for someone to write true ideas on them. Our minds, which are intimately connected with our imaginations, our emotions, and our physical bodies in a rich and multitextured combination, need to be sorted out just like the rest of us. If we insist on keeping our mental, emotional, and imaginative world the way it’s always been, the good news just won’t fit. We will then either reject it or distort it, cutting off the bits we can’t fit in or reshaping parts to conform to the ideas we already have.21 And so it is our whole mind-set, our whole way of seeing that needs to be cleansed in order to receive the good news. Jesus was so challenging to many of his hearers because he constantly pushed them to see things differently.</p>
<p>He wasn’t giving new or more detailed answers to questions they were already asking. He was doing and saying things designed to tease his hearers into facing new and dangerous questions, into looking at familiar ideas (such as the kingdom of God) from new and unexpected angles.</p>
<p>Most people, then and now, find that disturbing and try to avoid it.22</p>

<p>As long-term inmates of our respective dungeon-hideouts, we really do not
see reality as it is, which leads to a delusional understanding of the human
condition. For example, we call the formulae of science “concrete facts,”

</blockquote>
<h2>Removing The Veil</h2>
<p>There are multiple instances in the narrative of Scripture where this idea of the “removing of the veil” can be seen. It is noteworthy that the New Testament word for truth (aleitheia) literally means unveiling, unconcealment, disclosedness, and so the concept is implied in the revelation of truth itself.24 The writers of Scripture often use the imagery/ metaphor of unveiling when it comes to the knowledge of God and to various theophanies. For instance, Paul refers to it in 2 Corinthians 3:13– 18: “Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed” (2 Corinthians 3:15–16 NRSV); it is mentioned throughout the writings of the Old Testament prophets, including in the vision of the Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37), where God unveils Ezekiel’s eyes to see what he was calling Israel toward; and, of course, we see it in the tearing of the temple veil at the death of Jesus, with all its associated symbolism.</p>
<p>Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 77 Aparticularly powerful experience of unveiling occurs in Genesis, when Jacob settled in for the night after a long day of walking.</p>
<p>He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</p>
<blockquote>

of Jacob’s unveiling. The more significant revelation was the presence of

<h2>Genesis 28:13, 15 NRSV</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>God graciously grants assurance to Jacob that wherever he travelled,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God would be with him and would eventually bring him back home—a completely foreign concept in this culture. The pagan gods of the time never moved but instead were believed to reside in religious places, places where gods were expected to be—temples, holy sites, altars, etc. But this God was showing something different. This God could apparently speak to anybody, anywhere, anytime, and Jacob seems to acknowledge this: “Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, ‘Surely the Lord is in this place—and I did not know it!’” (Genesis 28:16 NRSV, italics ours).</p>
<p>Jacob—like Isaiah, Ezekiel, Paul, John, and many others after him—had his “perceptions cleansed” in the midst of a shadowy existence. Having seen “thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern,” he became aware of a reality that had been there all along. When he lay down that night and put his head on the stone pillow, life itself, in the material, was simply all that he knew; all that he experienced. But then he was shown a deeper awareness, an awareness of something/Someone that had always been there, but Jacob had never noticed.</p>
<p>This unveiling reoriented his life. His world was expanded. Ours no less.</p>
<p>In the 1998 film The Truman Show, Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, who stars in a twenty-four-hour-a-day television reality show, unbeknownst to him.25 “In Truman’s world, everything is phony, from the sun in the sky to the traffic reports on the radio to his relationship with his best friend.” All the characters except Truman are professional actors “giving us phony emotions.” 26 He’s a real person, but in a totally plastic world; his reality is relative. Gradually, Truman’s perception changes. Little by little he gets hints that the world he has grown up in is not the whole story. Cracks appear in the facade of his reality. He becomes dissatisfied with his life in Seahaven (the fictitious town). He begins to realize he no longer has a sense of what is real and that it is possible there is a bigger reality than he ever imagined he could experience.</p>
<p>The Truman Show is a story about how one man living a counterfeit life discovers the truth, and once he does, he has to decide whether to be honest about his situation or to go on living an artificial sham of an existence.</p>
<p>We are all confronted with this same dilemma. Once we become aware of the counterfeit life we have invested in, will we continue to live as we always have, or will we seek to walk in Truth? If we are locked in to a certain pre-determined way of perceiving, if we are deeply committed to a given way of seeing things (and who isn’t?), if we have taken up residence in Seahaven, all this talk about unveiling and reorienting and having your world expanded could be experienced as a threat. To grow and develop in our experience of God, we need to reconsider our approach to reality and be willing to view things differently. We need to make the move to widen and cleanse the doors of perception to a better comprehension of the reality that is infinite.</p>
<h2>All IKnow Is All There Is</h2>
<p>The seminal psychologist William James tussled with the idea of a “fixed mind-set” in his Varieties of Religious Experience.27 He lamented the fact that the vast majority of humans lock themselves up in static ideas and notions that are obsolete, or just plain wrong. However, most of us continue to insist these are true because we are just too lazy or fearful (or both) to reconsider. It turns out that the biggest blockage to the next experience of God is the last experience of him because it is the one in which our perceptions find themselves deeply rooted.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The sad reality is that, although most of us are open to new concepts early on in life and often into young adulthood, this tends to stop once we move beyond college. By the way, if you are interested in finding the most enlightened of all individuals on the planet, you can no doubt find them in any university freshmen dorm room, late at night, learning to play guitar as they sit around “illuminating” each other. But it seems that once this formal season of learning is complete, our minds are made up, and our decisions and utterances are an endless repetition of views that have in the meantime become obsolete, outworn, and unsound. This applies to politics, scholarship, and the arts as well as social service. Views, just like leaves, are bound to wither, because the world is in flux. But so many of us would rather be faithful to outworn views than undergo the strain of re-examination and revision. Indeed, intellectual senility sets in long before physical infirmity.29 We tend to have an overdependence on the waning intellect of our twentysomething selves. Perhaps we might instead learn to assess the authenticity of a person’s life by how many times we are able to see the world from a new perspective. (And when we say “we,” this is very much inclusive of us as authors.) Our point is, yes, we have to move beyond the idea that “we only see what we believe is possible.” But even further, we have to move to a place of being able to grasp the truth of “all I know is not all there is.” As we look closer at a culture in desperate need of widening its doors of perception, we should note that those who refuse to leave their narrowed existence are actually stating the exact opposite: “All I know really is all there is.” Consider the absurd nature of this statement: “You know, now that I’ve thought about it … Yes, I truly believe that all that I know, all that I have been able to comprehend is truly all that there is. Regardless of evidence to the contrary, I am positive that my breadth of knowledge and experience encompasses all that has ever been or ever will be.” It is hard to imagine any person in their right mind making such a bold and arrogant statement. Yet, when we take a step back and observe a culture of people (not just those on the Camino or at Burning Man, but those in the supermarket or at church), we realize that most of us, whether we articulate it or not, believe that, “all we know is all there is.” We might never utter those words, but a truth does not have to be stated to be a reality.</p>
<p>Consider discussions surrounding politics, economics, and social perspectives; even more superficially, think about those with locked-in opinions on such things as entertainment, sports, or even our favorite foods or restaurants. Aperspective of life that deep down buys into an “all I know is all there is” ideology is missing out on so much, and is probably fairly miserable to be around too.30 “All I know is all there is. My experience must be the sum total of human existence.” How very prehistoric of us to even consider these statements to be true.</p>
<p>If we go back into Blake’s concept of “the doors of perception,” we realize he is diagnosing a universal longing for things to be made right, a longing that is limited by a profoundly incomplete perception of reality.</p>
<p>How ridiculous to believe that the limit of all that is just and true and beautiful in our world is within our grasp when all we have seen and experienced is a darkened cave. The belief that “shadows” constitute reality, simply because one has never seen or known anything else, explains so much about our world.</p>
<p>Take for example the “worldly” (disenchanted) experience of beauty.</p>
<p>This view of beauty is divorced from its total context—such a beauty still captivates to some extent but fails to point beyond itself, and so it ensnares the viewer in an idolatrous hold. Real beauty on the other hand goes well beyond the appreciation of some perceived loveliness of an image in a magazine or in the magnificence of nature, and leads to an enchanted encounter with a transcendent beauty that captivates and “transports” the beholder into an immediate experience of it, not just the aesthetic appreciation. This is what the Bible calls the splendor/glory of the Lord. In the darkened experience of the cave, people readily accept a false measure of beauty and self-image—eating disorders, depression, breakdowns of relationships all stem from this hollow perception.</p>

<p>METa NOIA: THECLEANSINGOFPERCEPTION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owen Barfield, one of the Inklings, wisely alerts us that our way out of any mental prison is to realize the limitations of our current mode of consciousness.35 The “first step of all is to realize that mental habit is a prison. […] But one way or another, what matters is our coming to realize that the way we habitually think and perceive is not the only possible way, not even a way that has been going on very long. It is the way we have come to think, the way we have come to perceive” (italics ours).36 Clearly, in order to reframe our understanding of God and the world, we have much un/learning to do. The Scriptures are absolutely clear on this—in fact, the first recorded words of Jesus initiate his ministry with this call: “After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’” (Mark 1:14–15).</p>
<p>This is directed at the people of God; as Danielle noted in the foreword, “the first calling [to repentance] is not to sinners but to saints.” And perhaps this calling is especially aimed at the religious leaders (those most certain about their beliefs). Israel too needed a cleansing of its collective perception before the people could truly see and comprehend who it was they were dealing with in Jesus. We learn from Jesus that those who have eyes to see and ears to hear are those who, by God’s grace, have been able to let go of such limited frameworks and to perceive the world anew under the condition called faith. It’s no different for us today. We need to have our perceptions cleansed and transformed if we are to be able to see and understand the truth. And yet “despite how often and how beautifully openness as a concept is held up and celebrated in our postmodern context, real change is just plain difficult.”37 In the New Testament this transformation is brought about by a process called metanoia and at its core entails the ongoing renewal of our paradigms and perceptions (nous). Metanoia is necessary for the ability to hear the Word and follow it. It involves a “turning”—a person’s radical decentering in favor of God. Certainly, a genuine conversion to Christian faith involves a fundamental transformation of our understanding. Without this, we will remain alienated from God, and his appearance in the form of a Servant will remain a scandal and an offence. Metanoia therefore represents a real challenge to the persistent attempts of postmodernists, who propose that we can discover the truth on quite different terms.</p>

<p>Engaging with true repentance has always been a challenge for the stubborn human mind, but even more so in our twenty-first-century “echo chambers,” in which our beliefs are amplified and reinforced within our closed networks. We must recognize that the shift required for a person to come to a place of repentance is monumental. It can only truly happen when the Holy Spirit opens our hearts and minds to “see” another way: “when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth” (John 16:13). One of the sacred roles of the Holy Spirit is to illumine us, to make us sensitive to the form of Christ in the world, to help us understand Scripture, and appropriate the truth and live into it. The Spirit will guide us out of the dungeon. Or, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2: 9–16: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived”— the things God has prepared for those who love him— these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who
knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the
same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.</p>
<p>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirittaught words. The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, “Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To overcome the problem of limiting perception and illusion, we must
learn how to truly pray, both for ourselves and those around us. For in
prayer (before God and in Christ and by the Spirit) we can no longer live
it. “Prayer is the atmosphere of all conversion; other discourse leaves in</p>

<p>Lo O K I N G “At ” O R “ T H R O U G H ” A W I N D O
I (Mark) lived for ten years in a beautiful, one-hundred-year-old home
in a small, rural midwestern town. Among its many unique features was
funds, the windows were not the efficient, newer windows, but instead were
these were huge, with each one measuring five feet tall and five feet wide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were multiple similar-sized windows throughout the house, but this was my favorite … because of the view.</p>
<p>Our house was positioned on the corner of the main street in town, and by turning off all the lights in the house and peering out of that corner Thro ’ Narrow Chinks in the Cavern 85 window, there was a rather picturesque view of the main street … especially when it snowed. Looking through the window at the falling snow, with a corner streetlight magnifying each flake a hundred times, was, or at least was close to, a holy experience.</p>
<p>But when I stopped and examined a small crack that had appeared in the bottom right corner, I saw that this was also the window that had paint flecks on it due to sloppy trim work; and a layer of dust, dirt, and grime in between the actual window and the screen window; not to mention enough ladybug corpses to fill an insect graveyard. It was not nearly the same euphoric, holy experience from this perspective.</p>
<p>Here’s what I learned: there is a huge difference between looking at a window and looking through a window. When I looked at that front corner window, I saw the cracked glass and the need for a thorough cleaning. When I looked through the window, I saw, among other things, the beautiful snow-covered streets of my very own personal Narnia. How I saw the world depended upon how I approached the window.</p>
<p>We need to see the world differently. We need to see the pilgrims on the Camino and Playa with a different set of eyes. We can look at the window and only see the overwhelming brokenness in front of us, a world that is wandering the deserts and trails of life with no sense of the divine. Or we can look through the window, beyond what we think we already know, beyond what we have perceived to be true of our culture, and understand that perhaps it is all of us, those who believe and those who do not, who have been peering through these “narrow chinks of a cavern.”</p>
<h2>Lift Up Your Gates, You Ancient Doors!</h2>
<p>Blake’s poetry suggests that instead of going ever deeper into the cave, we should step closer to the opening, and eventually extend our heads through the aperture where we are able to see things as they really are … seemingly vast and unbounded.</p>
<p>And it is to our collective condition of reductionism, idolatry, irresponsibility, withdrawal, fear, self-protection, rebellion, and unreality, that the psalmist calls us to cleanse our perception, and fling open the ancient doors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;
for he founded it on the seas
and established it on the waters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?</p>
<p>Who may stand in his holy place?</p>
<p>The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors,
that the King of glory may come in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is he, this King of glory?</p>
<p>The Lord Almighty— he is the King of glory.</p>
<h2>Psalm 24:1–7; 9–10</h2>
<p>We surely have some kind of role in bringing people to a place of deeper awareness, don’t we? To tell a story where the reality of God is experienced, an experience much richer and deeper than any of us have ever believed to be possible? But how do we begin amongst a generation that seemingly doesn’t want to hear the story of a reality that has been there all along?</p>
<p>Philosopher Martin Buber answered this way: This generation must be made receptive […] to the voice of the mystery which speaks in those utterances. And we should not do all this with the purpose of preparing them to repeat the teachings and perform rites, but so that they may acquire the power to make the original choice, that— listening to the voice with that power—they may hear the message it has for their hour and their work that they may learn to trust the voice, and through this trust, come to faith, to a faith of their own.42 Can we really make this generation receptive to a reality that has been obscured? Can we help cleanse these doors of perception and open wide these ancient doors?</p>
<p>SECTION 3</p>
<h2>Are/Enchanting</h2>
<p>In section one, we explored the nature of the eclipse of God and of the reduction of our knowledge and experience of him, which has resulted in a much smaller, diminished, heretical grasp of the faith. We have consequently reduced the story of God to dry doctrine and tasteless tofu, resulting in a reduced life that simply settles for a narrow (hellish) existence.</p>
<p>Section two examined the idea of cultural and missional anthropology and asked questions surrounding the idea of longing and desire. Our lack of understanding of culture and our reluctance to admit that all we know is not all there is, has resulted in a cave-dwelling existence from which all of us should be rescued. There simply must be a turning away from a confined and narrow way of perceiving and receiving truth, both about God and this broken world.</p>
<p>In this third section, we want to introduce ways to reimagine our view of God and the world. We propose that to correct the reduction in our theology—our understanding of God—we will first need to recover the art of seeing God in larger and wider frames. To move from ossified doctrines, wooden proclamations, empty doxologies, and legalistic ethics toward a great reframation, there must be a re/enchanting of all that has been extracted and siphoned from the story. As we begin to enlarge our frames, we propose we’ll not only begin to see a “bigger” God, but we’ll also live and tell a bigger, more beautiful story.</p>
