<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Hey, we said to read this bit last, so if you've just bought this book and</p>
<p>skipped right to our conclusion, turn back and start from the beginning.</p>
<p>We need you to take the journey with us in rediscovering the alternate vision offered by Jesus; the journey of defragging all the inappropriate and unbiblical pictures of Jesus you’ve accumulated over the years; the journey of reencountering a Hebraic framework for seeing and following Jesus as the visible presence of the one and only God; the journey of exploring what a Jesus-built church would look like.</p>
<p>Once you’ve walked that road with us, then we want you to turn your
attention to the following image.</p>
<h2>Two Men Walk into an Inn...</h2>
<p>Two middle-aged men meet in an inn in a small, unremarkable village.</p>
<p>They embrace, their heavy, solid hands slapping each others’ broad backs affectionately. They kiss twice, on each cheek. They sit and eat, hunching over the shared table in a conspiratorial way. The dust that coats their faces highlights the deepening lines around their eyes. Their graying beards betray the years. They are like two old lions, warriors who’ve fought many a battle but live to fight another day.</p>
<p>Wiping crumbs from his mustache with the back of his hand, one says with a</p>
<p>The other looks up and raises his eyebrows.
“I just mean,” continues the first man, “I haven’t seen you for a while, and you
seem to have aged quite a bit in that time.” Another smirk.
The other man starts to defend himself but instead waves his hand dismissively
at his friend. “Why do I even bite at comments like that?” he smiles. “You’re not</p>
<p>They both smile, and the first man reaches across and places his hand on
confesses.
“Agreed. And the disappointment. I could bear the travel, the strange lodgings,
the mishaps. But the disappointment of hearing about comrades turning from
the most. I’ve heard it makes me look old,” he says, eyeing his friend warily.
“Very old, actually.” They laugh. Silence.</p>
<p>After a while, the first man says, “The Corinthians still causing you a headache,</p>
<p>“Headaches and whiskers are nothing, Peter. Have you heard the latest? You
rejected me as an apostle. Apparently, they prefer more gifted leaders! Can
even such a long time, they’re still babies in Christ. Don’t get me started on
of freedom, tolerance of immoral brothers, taking pride in their spiritual gifts,
just a complete lack of love. I’ve written them four letters about all this, and
writing and start fighting. Teach ‘em a lesson with my fists that my letters obviCorinth?”
“Clobbering Corinthians probably won’t do the trick, comrade. Though I am
inclined to join you,” Peter smiles sympathetically.
“How is the cell at Galatia? Have you had contact with them?” Paul asks after
downing a mouthful from his cup. Peter shakes his head slowly. Paul continues,
“Their faith was not strong enough to resist the confusions stirred up by the
teaching of the Jewish Christians about the circumcision requirement, and they
my authority, too.”
And so it goes. Two tired men sharing back and forth, recounting stories of new
cells in Asia Minor, new converts in Europe, new developments in Greece.
Finally Paul says, “Peter, I’m not sure when I’ll see you again....”</p>
<p>“You say that every time we get together.”
“I know, and it’s always true. But in case our paths never cross again, can you
tell me about him one more time.”
Peter smiles sadly, “Oh, Paul, you’ve heard me tell you those stories a million</p>
<p>times. You tell them yourself better than I do.”
Paul leans forward toward his friend. “Comrade, I’ve been beaten, abandoned,
betrayed, shipwrecked, and left for dead. It’s hard to think of a cell I’ve planted
hungry. And, well, according to some of my friends, I look like an old man. The
times it feels arduous. I long for the Lord as the watchman longs for the end of
we’re planting will become the movement we dreamed of. Yes, I do wonder.</p>
<p>Then he fixes his eyes firmly on Peter’s and says, pleading, “Tell me again.”
We can imagine ourselves standing in the doorway of the ancient inn,</p>
<p>looking into the darkened room and seeing two battle-weary warriors sharing
have met like this and spoken in this way? Who can say? But there seems
and was the lifeblood of their mission. Indeed, writing to the Romans, Paul
set apart for the gospel of God” (Rom 1:1). What is the “gospel of God” for
dogma, a collection of beliefs and practices centered on Jesus? In fact, it’s far</p>
<p>Listen as he explains:</p>
<p>[the gospel] he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriping to the flesh and was declared to be Son of God with power according to the
spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through
whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of
are called to belong to Jesus Christ. (Rom 1:2–6)
When Paul explains the content of his gospel, it doesn’t consist of propositional statements about creation, sin, atonement, and redemption. It is a
messianic credentials, his physical descent from David, his vindication by the
gospel given to us in Matthew’s Gospel. In effect, Romans 1:1–6 is a Reader’s</p>
<p>Later in Romans, Paul offers an even more truncated version of the
same message, when he writes,</p>
<p>But what does it say? “The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart”
lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the</p>
<p>Scholars believe that this was obviously the repetition of a well-known
creed of the time. If it is a simple creedal statement, then note its trajectory. It
is a super-summarized version of Matthew, Mark, or Luke. Compare it with the
from light, true light from true light, begotten not made, of one being with the
he offers his preferred version of the gospel: “Remember Jesus Christ, raised</p>
<p>Facts. History. This is my gospel.</p>
<p>Probably nowhere is this expressed more urgently by him than in his
advice to the Corinthians in the conduct of their public feast:</p>
<p>Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you,
are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried,
appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. (1 Cor 15:1–5, tniv)
Jesus died for our sins. He was the fulfillment of prophecy. He rose</p>
<p>again. He appeared to witnesses. This is our gospel, anchored in the person
there seems enough evidence to suggest that most of what Paul taught to his
death, resurrection, and appearances of Jesus. His epistles deal with specific
fact that the gospel he preached to them, the doctrine he’d immersed them</p>
<p>The importance of [these] creedal statements should not be underestimated
tians, and of the Pauline missionaries in particular. In his letters, Paul (and
length. The ‘gospel’ tends to be a shared assumption throughout the epistles,</p>
<p>Today, too many Christians are reading Romans as though it is Paul’s
exposition of the gospel—creation, sin, atonement. But Romans and the
other epistles were applications of the gospel rather than expositions of it.</p>
<p>Paul is assuming the Romans remember the amazing story of Jesus he had taught them. In fact, when Paul preaches the gospel it sounds more like Acts 13 than Romans 1–3:</p>
<p>When he had removed him [Saul], he made David their king. In his testimony
will carry out all my wishes.’ Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a
a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing
coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.’
us the message of this salvation has been sent. Because the residents of Jeruprophets that are read every sabbath, they fulfilled those words by condemnPilate to have him killed. When they had carried out everything that was written
raised him from the dead, and for many days he appeared to those who came
people. And we bring you the good news that what God promised to our ancesto you, therefore, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is prosins from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. (Acts 13:22–39)
Note the following three things: first, this sermon is a virtual summary</p>
<p>of the Gospels, particularly Mark and Luke, focusing on the events of Jesus’
creedal statements we previously looked at in Romans and 2 Timothy, with
ence to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith, rooting it firmly in the</p>
<p>We don’t wish to imply that doctrinal statements are useless. But doctrinal purity for its own sake has riven churches apart and led to the current
proliferation of denominations and competing Christian agencies. For Paul,
and is developed into propositional statement must find its locus in the story</p>
<p>Did Paul and Peter ever meet in a darkened inn, share a meal, and swap
stories? We don’t know, but if they did, we have little doubt that the stories
they would have swapped wouldn’t have been the trivial or the nostalgic. We
being. Try to imagine those battered old lions telling those stories, re Jesusing</p>
