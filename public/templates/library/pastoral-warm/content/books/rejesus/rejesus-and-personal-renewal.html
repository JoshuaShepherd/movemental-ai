<h1>ReJesus and Personal Renewal</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>My mission is to introduce Christianity into Christendom.
—Søren Kierkegaard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to admit that there is an immeasurable distance between all that we read in the Bible and the way we actually live our lives. Only in this sense can I speak validly of perversion or subversion, for, in truth, there is a huge gap between what we read and what is required of us.</p>
<p>We believe it is not possible to be following the biblical Jesus and not end up being molded by the missio Dei, participatio Christi, and imago Dei. When taken captive by Jesus, we cannot help but see God, the church, and the world differently. Taking Jesus as our starting point, let us now look more deeply into the nature of discipleship. We do this not so much to outline the contours of his teaching—so many books have done that already—but rather to try and find its spiritual centers, to touch the wild and primal energy that lies at the heart of his message. It is that his people historically have obscured the dynamic of his message that makes this task so urgent. So let us turn our attention to an exploration of the connection between Jesus, the disciple, and the church. We use the word "disciple" deliberately because it emphasizes the kind of relationship that is involved. What is the church if not a community of disciples, of people devoted to following Jesus?</p>
<p>If the New Testament is our guide in these matters, then discipleship should be the defining quality of the Christian life. And if this is the case, then we can never move from the more primal commitment that is involved in becoming his follower in the first place.</p>
<p>And yet, the ethos of discipleship and the presence of the wild Messiah are not readily associated with church and Christianity of our day. Far from it, our expressions of church range generally from what we might call the fundamentalist fortress, where the church is seen as a bastion against the world and a refuge from the lower echelons of the cosmos, to the more prevalent contemporary seeker-sensitive church, where Jesus is reduced to a kind of spiritual accessory in a consumerist paradise. From the fundamentalist who sees Jesus as a stern judge to the liberal who sees him as a schmaltzy moralist, it is probably fair to say that we have largely lost touch with the wild, untamable, and surprising Redeemer-Lord. This is the Jesus so powerfully portrayed in the Gospels. That we have lost touch with this Jesus must account for a significant part of the spiritual bankruptcy of the church in the West. The cost of this loss cannot be underestimated.</p>
<h2>Rebooting to Jesus</h2>
<p>If it is not already clear, let us state it emphatically: We believe that Christology is the key to the renewal of the church in every age and in every possible situation it might find itself. The church must always return to Jesus. When it loses its way in the world, it needs to recover its primal identity in its founder.</p>
<p>It is not good enough to return to the founder of whatever denomination or organization we find ourselves in, although revitalization of that kind is not without merit. For Salvationists to rediscover the fire and fight within William Booth or for Methodists to have a re-encounter with John Wesley's passion and theology is valuable. But, when there is something fundamentally wrong in the basic equation of the faith, then it is time to recover a vital and active sense of Jesus: who he is, what he has done for us, the way of life he laid down for us to follow. His passions and concerns must become ours. In other words, as stated earlier, Christology must determine missiology (our purpose and function in this world), which in turn must determine ecclesiology (the cultural forms and expressions of the church).</p>
<p>Putting aside the issue of how missiology must inform ecclesiology (as that is dealt with in our previous books, specifically <em>The Shaping of Things to Come</em> and <em>The Forgotten Ways</em>), we believe that Christology is the singularly most important factor in determining the nature of our spirituality and ministry that result from that engagement. There must be a constant recalibration back to Jesus. There is no point in revamping our missiology or inventing new cultural forms of ecclesia unless we first recalibrate to Jesus. This is the missing and unguided task of many so-called church renewal projects currently underway.</p>
<p>Some such projects maintain that we need to get our theology and preaching right and renewal will flow from there. Others insist on Spirit-filled worship or alternative worship or church planting or a postmodernized approach to the faith. We are skeptical. Whenever these strategies are not anchored directly in a biblical Christology, they are doomed to limited effectiveness.</p>
<p>So, allow us to portray it this way:</p>
<p><strong>Christology</strong> → <strong>determines</strong> → <strong>Missiology</strong> → <strong>determines</strong> → <strong>Ecclesiology</strong></p>
<p>Before there is any consideration given to the particular aspects of ecclesiology, such as leadership, evangelism, or worship, there ought to be a thoroughgoing attempt to reconnect the church with Jesus; that is, to reJesus the church through the recovery of a radical New Testament Christology. The church's mission as well as its forms must flow from a direct encounter with Jesus the Lord. And this is not something that is casual and intermittent. As Visser T'Hooft once put it, "It belongs to the very life of the people of God that they should be in constant dialogue with its Lord and his holy will."^[1]</p>
<p>Think of it like a form of recalibration. When a machine gets jammed, the only way to kick-start it is to reset it to its original formulation. It's like a computer. When things go haywire and all else fails, we reboot it. By rebooting a computer, we restore its original operational settings, thus allowing it to function again. This is precisely the image that we wish to convey—that by rebooting to Jesus, we restore the church to its original operational settings and make it functional again.</p>
<p>The author of Hebrews also describes him as Founder and Perfecter of faith (Heb 12:2). Surely these titles have profound implications for the life of the disciple and in the life of the Christian community. If Jesus is Founder and Perfecter, then Christology claims central place in our self-understanding. If he is Founder and Perfecter, then he not only sets the primary template for authentic faith but also works at helping us bring it into mature expression.</p>
<p>We want to address this in two primary dimensions. First, the reJesus project for individual followers of Jesus is the reJesusing of personal discipleship. Second, the reJesus project for the church is the renewal of the church as an organization. This chapter is individually oriented and focuses on the first dimension.</p>
<h2>Resisting Evil</h2>
<p>As a little Jesus, Dietrich Bonhoeffer refused to bend his knee to the Nazi regime. When Hitler's government attempted to implement a policy to merge all Protestant churches into a pro-Nazi Protestant church, Bonhoeffer spoke out defiantly that the church is not an organ of the state, but is subject only to Christ. Though he had opportunities to escape—including an offer to teach at Union Seminary in New York—he returned to Germany, believing that he would never have a voice in Germany after the war if he didn't stand with his people during it. He found an opportunity to resist Hitler through his brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi, an officer in the military intelligence agency Abwehr and a key figure in the covert resistance movement. Von Dohnanyi arranged for Bonhoeffer to help Jews escape across the border, as well as to Sweden, where he met with British bishop George Bell to try to secure Allied support for the resistance. When his role in helping Jews escape across the border into Switzerland was traced to Bonhoeffer, the Nazis arrested him in 1943. While he was in prison, a group of officers attempted to assassinate Hitler but failed. The Nazis tied Bonhoeffer to this plot as well, and in 1945, a month before the war ended, they executed him. His death, along with the deaths of millions, but his courage in resisting evil and in paying the ultimate cost for his fidelity to the way of Jesus stands as a powerful example of what it means to be a little Jesus.</p>
<h2>The Capturing of Our Imaginations</h2>
<p>Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits (one of the most significant Catholic missionary orders), developed a set of spiritual exercises for his followers. A significant, aspect of the exercises was the requirement of the novitiate, as well as the ongoing members of the order, to encounter Jesus more directly. We will return to what this entailed in a later chapter, but for now, let us note that capturing our imagination is an important thing to do.</p>
<p>Ask yourself what stimuli provoke your imagination on any given day. In other words, what stuff, coming at you from the world in which you live, most arouses or inspires you and your worldview? Television? Movies? Video games, sports, novels, business, the Internet? And yet these are not benign or valueless entertainments. They are owned or controlled by powerful forces in our society. They collectively contribute to a collective imagination that shapes us all: consumerist, materialist, individualist. In <em>Exiles</em>, Michael explored the way in which our post-Christian culture is not dissimilar to the empires into which the Old Testament exiles, Daniel, Esther, and Joseph, were repatriated. Our current empire is no more friendly to our faith than Babylon was to, say, Daniel's faith. Like all empires, our society seeks to maintain control over us in a variety of ways. These ways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the threat of violence (having a powerful army helps)</li>
<li>the dominance of the economic system</li>
<li>the capturing of the imagination of the people by various means (propaganda, advertising, the ubiquity of the emperor's image on coins, artifacts, and statues)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the last point, how is the ubiquity of Caesar's image any different from the intrusive and all-pervasive nature of the tools employed by our current empire? Our current empire seeks to claim our total allegiance by dominating our imaginations. Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat explore this in their commentary on Paul's letter to the Colossians. They suggest that in order to overcome the ubiquity of Caesar's image, the Colossian Christians organized their lives and their thinking around a christological center. They structured their imaginations around Jesus and the story about him and in so doing structured their lives around Jesus.^[2] As we saw in chapter 1, this is precisely what we need to do.</p>
<p>One of the most urgent reasons why we need to re-envision ourselves around Jesus is that our imaginations so easily become captive to the dominant forces in our culture, whether those forces are economic, political, or religious. Our perceptions of Jesus readily become domesticated through familiarity, fear of change, or simple laziness. We lose sight of the wild, untamable, surprising Redeemer-Lord. Idolatry still has its lure, and in modern democratic societies and free-market economies, it seems to have become almost totally pervasive and yet more subtle at the same time. The domination of the free-market-based consumption other than the reaction against it seems to have become the dominant ideology of our day. We have capitulated to the economic ideology of our day. Says Tom Sine,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This imagery of the good life and a better future, that pervades Western society, is born of the Enlightenment and the rise of modernity. Essentially, the Enlightenment took the Christian vision of the future, which had been a centerpiece of European culture, and turned it on its side. It secularized it and made it about economic growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This vision of a better future is called the Western Dream or the American Dream, and now it is the driving myth behind the new imperial global economic system. The advertising industry, the entertainment industry, and the merchants of "cool" are seeking to influence people everywhere on this planet.^[3]</p>
<p>Furthermore, Walsh and Keesmaat state, "The messages are all telling the same story.... economic growth is the driving force of history, consumer choice is what makes us human, and greed is normal. If we live in an empire that tells us this story, then we need an alternative story for our lives."^[4]</p>
<p>Into this profoundly religious empire, made up of the idolatrous lure of money, sexuality, competing ideologies and visions, comes an alternative imagination. We need to imagine how Jesus would respond to the cultural and religious issues of our day. The "What Would Jesus Do?" (WWJD) movement of a few years back was a good start, but it was too often domesticated into a movement that limited the issue to private morality and then further trivialized into an accessory for young adult Christians. This is unfortunate, because WWJD has in it the capacity to take the lordship of Jesus over all of life seriously indeed. We would like to relaunch the campaign but with a broader scope: What would Jesus do with the consumptive world in which we live? How would he respond to the environment? What would Jesus do with television? What would Jesus do with our money and resources in a world of poverty and need? The lordship of Jesus cannot be limited to personal piety and must extend to all of life—to the realms of economics, environment, and politics if we are to truly unlock the world-transforming power of the gospel.</p>
<p>Our imagination is such a powerful force. Jesus pointed out, "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matt 6:21). In other words, the things that capture our imaginations (our treasures), whether they are wealth, power, security, or comfort, will determine the direction of our lives. This is why he insisted that we store ourselves "treasures in heaven" (Matt 6:20). If we allow Jesus to capture our imaginations, our actions and priorities will mirror his lifestyle and teaching. The church needs an alternative imagination to that of the empire in which it finds itself.</p>
<p>In this respect, Walter Brueggemann comments on the role of the preacher as the source of an alternative, Christ-centered imagination. If the church needs to be continually reJesused, then those who give voice to the church's message must be about the task of capturing collective imaginations in the gospel. Says Brueggemann,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The event of preaching is an event of transformed imagination... Because finally church people are like other people; we are not changed by new rules. The deep places in our lives—places of resistance and embrace are reached only by images, by stories, by images, metaphors and phrases that line out the world differently, apart from our fear and hurt.^[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've heard too many sermons about how to be better citizens. Too much preaching is concerned with the fostering of a capitulation to the mores and values of a post-Christian empire rather than a call to allow our imaginations to be captured by Jesus.</p>
<h2>The Conspiracy of Little Jesuses</h2>
<p>Often the wake-up call to embrace an alternate imagination has to be made in a stark and uncompromising fashion. The 2005 film <em>V for Vendetta</em> is a powerful example of this. In the film, the British people have handed their imaginations (so to speak) over to a dictator whose empire is reminiscent of the totalitarian state described in the novel <em>1984</em>. A revolutionary in a mask, calling himself only V, embarks on a mission to wake the people up. In one scene, he takes over a British television studio and broadcasts an incendiary message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.^[6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The film climaxes after V's death, with thousands and thousands of Britons, all wearing Guy Fawkes masks, marching on the Houses of Parliament in an unstoppable wave of resistance. V has duplicated himself in the imaginations of the people. In this respect, V epitomizes what we've been talking about. He captures the imaginations of the people and then replicates himself in them. He fashions a grand conspiracy in which hundreds of thousands of little Vs stand together against the empire.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Alan coined the phrase "the conspiracy of little Jesuses" to describe this same idea as portrayed in <em>V for Vendetta</em>. Jesus takes captive the imaginations of his followers and then replicates himself in them. In fact, we can sum up the task of discipleship as the lifelong project of literally becoming like him, of becoming a little Jesus. But the whole process of becoming more like him moves quickly beyond the individual to the group and from there to a movement. Even a superficial reading of the New Testament indicates that it was Jesus' strategic intention to create a movement consisting of Christlike people inhabiting every possible nook and cranny of culture and society—hence the idea of a mass conspiracy.^[7]</p>
<p>Whether one talks about becoming a little Jesus or uses that wonderful old phrase "imitation (or following) of Christ," the essential function is clear—the modeling ourselves upon his life lies at the center of our spiritual formation. To be truly redeemed by Christ is, therefore, to impose on oneself the task of becoming like him. Christianity can be defined as a faith together with a corresponding way of life, and that way of life is the imitation of Christ.^[8]</p>
<p>The climactic scene in <em>V for Vendetta</em>, with countless Vs streaming out of side streets, leaping over barricades, and flowing like a torrent toward Parliament, represents the power that resides in such a conspiracy of imitation. Kierkegaard once said that "the imitator of Christ strives to be what he admires. Without this essential condition all attempts at following Christ are in vain."^[9] David Bosch rightly noted, "Discipleship is determined by the relation to Christ himself not by mere conformity to impersonal commands."^[10] He said this when commenting on how preachers have used the Great Commission. Too often, well-intentioned church leaders have simplistically presented the words of Jesus in Matthew 28:18–20 as if they were barked by a stern sergeant-major. If Jesus said it, we should do it! But Bosch points out that a commitment to mission based on an impersonal order from Jesus is built on a flimsy foundation. If our commitment to mission is based on obligation rather than love, then we have missed the point. It's not unlike a husband who, when his wife complains that he never brings her flowers, rushes out and buys her a bouquet and presents it to her, she might appreciate the flowers, but she knows that he bought them out of obligation, not love. What she wanted was for him to be motivated by his devotion for her so as to buy a gift. When we engage in mission only because we feel guilty that we haven't pleased Jesus and his order in the so-called Great Commission, we satisfy neither Jesus nor our own sense of calling. Rather, says Bosch, mission emerges from a deep, rich relationship with Jesus. The woman whose husband never brings her flowers doesn't want flowers. She wants him and his devotion. What Jesus is saying to his disciples in Matthew 28 is that little Jesuses will be naturally and normally about the business of making disciples, not to satisfy Jesus' demands but out of complete devotion for him. To paraphrase Bosch, the Great Commission is not a commission in the ordinary sense of the word, but rather a creative statement about the new order of things. Or as Garrett Green was noted for saying, "God is the one who conquers not by force, but by capturing the imagination of his fallen creatures."</p>
<p>However difficult it is to remain open to God, it is vital that this relationship must take the form of a direct and unmediated relationship with Jesus. It must involve a constantly renewed, up-to-date experience with our Lord. Without this, we end up with a Christianity that looks like the one Jesus started. Even though it might take the forms of Christian faith, it will lack the substance.</p>
<p>That discipleship is foundational to Christianity and its mission therefore goes without saying. If we fail here, we will fail everywhere.^[11] But the critical role of discipleship in the mission of the church once again highlights the need for a direct encounter with Jesus. Discipleship cannot merely involve a cerebral, objective, indirect understanding of Jesus and his teachings. The temptation to substitute an indirect encounter with Jesus for a direct encounter with Jesus is a constant temptation for the follower. This is partly because a direct encounter with Jesus is a challenging, unsettling, and demanding experience. We never get the better of him, and it is a constant challenge to our assumptions and our way of life. It is much easier to simply follow his teachings or a religious code developed in his wake.</p>
<p>Discipleship requires a direct and unmediated relationship with the Lord, and the loss of this immediacy is catastrophic to the movement that claims his name.</p>
<p>Dallas Willard rightly bemoans the fact that for quite a while now the churches in the Western world have not made discipleship a condition of being a Christian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One is not required to be, or to intend to be, a disciple in order to become a Christian, and one may remain a Christian without any signs of progress toward or in discipleship.... So far as the visible Christian institutions of our day are concerned, discipleship clearly is optional. Churches are filled with "undiscipled disciples." "Most problems in contemporary churches can be explained by the fact that members have not decided to follow Christ."^[12]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This living link between Jesus, discipleship, and authentic Christianity was highlighted by Dietrich Bonhoeffer when he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipleship means adherence to Christ and, because Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form of discipleship. An abstract Christology, a doctrinal system, a general religious knowledge of the subject of grace or any idea of discipleship whatsoever, and are essentially inimical to the whole concept of discipleship. Christianity without discipleship is always Christianity without Christ.^[13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last sentence of this quote highlights the issue for us. At stake at the heart of discipleship is nothing less than the embodiment and transmission of the gospel. Who wants a Christianity without Christ? Well, if we are to be faithful to the gospel, we had better be sure we keep our focus on disciple making as a key task. It is discipleship that creates spiritual authority. It also gives much needed credibility to our witness. The whole matter of the embodiment and transmission of the gospel is bound up with discipleship. It is discipleship that provides the foundation for its authentic transmission from generation to generation. All of these things are bound together and all are bound inextricably to our relationship with Jesus.</p>
<h2>Critic of Religiosity</h2>
<p>Like Jesus attacking Pharisaism, Søren Kierkegaard came out swinging against the established church of his day. "When someone proclaims the truth, an auditor is responsible for discovering counterfeits," he wrote. He saw it as his mission to be an auditor of Christendom, an institution he charged with having lost its way. The church, he wrote, was "just about as genuine as tea made from a bit of paper that had once been used to wrap up a few dried tea leaves from which tea had already been made three times." One of the fathers of existentialism, this remarkably complex and intelligent man underwent a profound spiritual transformation at the age of thirty-five and thereafter sought to apply some of his existentialist ideas to Christianity and thus challenge the nominal Christianity of his day. He called for a "leap of faith" in order to enter into authentic Christianity. As a little Jesus, he hoped that his brutal honesty would make them re-examine their relationship to Jesus.</p>
<p>The difficulty that we face in this issue of embodiment and transmission is that it is directly related to the credibility of the gospel. Our witness to the truth of the gospel is validated or invalidated by the way we live. Non-Christian people watch us. We are not allowed off the ethical hook by admitting that we are sinners. The demand for authentic embodiment is nonetheless undiminished. The Bible, claims Jacques Ellul, insists on the inseparability of truth and practice. We have to understand this. No recognizable revelation exists apart from the testimony to God and to the meaning of this revelation. "See how they love one another," was the early church's witness. "If you do not love one another, you do not have the love of God in you," etc. There is no truth apart from the embodiment of what we ourselves do. If Christians are not conformed in their lives to their faith, then for all practical purposes, there is [effectively] no truth. This is why the accusers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were right to infer the falsity of revelation itself from the behavior of Christians. If our lives do not match the demands we render all revelation false, illusory, ideological, imaginary, and non-existent to those who do not believe. This is undeniable proof of the need for correct practice.^[14]</p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, we carry the burden of having to live out the truth in such a way as to establish its viability among those who are watching. A recent survey asked a group of people who identified themselves as "strong followers of Jesus" and asked them, "Do you believe it is important to help the poor?" Eighty percent replied in the affirmative, leaving a disturbing 20 percent of so-called strong followers of Jesus who apparently don't think helping the poor is important. That this should be the case should remind us of the levels of Christian ignorance about our own faith. When the same group was asked, "Do you spend time with the poor?" Only 2 percent replied that they did. This reveals a huge gap between our beliefs about Jesus and our actions. This disconnection lies at the nub of the problem. As Kierkegaard put it, "Christ is the Truth inasmuch as He is the way. He who does not follow in the way also wanders from the Truth, no matter how much he may be speculating about him."^[15]</p>
<p>But beyond issues relating to the mission of Jesus' people, the whole matter of the leadership and ministry of the church is also directly bound to discipleship. Discipleship has exponential results in terms of spirituality, ministry, and mission, because Jesus is the source of all authentic ministry.</p>
<h2>Face Time with Jesus</h2>
<p>Why the church tends to so easily lose this central focus on discipleship is a bit of a historical puzzle because it forms such a strategically significant part of our task as his people in the world. Perhaps it is because it is an essentially relational task that comes naturally to us. We do it unconsciously all the time. This task of internalizing the values and lifestyle of another person is called imitation, and the biblical way of seeing this process is called conformation (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 3:18).</p>
<p>The Bible understands Christian formation in a way that is largely unfamiliar to us. In the New Testament, Jesus does not disciple people by generating a list of rules for them to follow. Rather, discipleship always involves a deeply personal process of being drawn into the life of another. The German Dietrich Bonhoeffer latched onto this idea and made it central to his understanding of discipleship. He called it conformation—conformation into his likeness, as conformation with the unique form of Him who was made man, was crucified, and rose again.^[16] Jesus continues to incarnate himself in the world through his people: "The church is the presence of Christ, and this presence is realized in the obedient, con-formation of human beings to the form of the biblical Christ, who is the form of God."^[17] Bonhoeffer pointed out that this cannot be a matter of abstract theologizing or merely following a set of rules. It requires direct reference to Jesus and his commands.</p>
<p>The image of Jesus to which we are called to conform to is not some sort of religious nut concerned with other-worldly religious matters as if the world didn't matter. If we look at the Jesus in the Gospels, then it means being drawn into the pattern of true humanity in the fullest sense. In Jesus, God has given us the archetype of what it means to be human. Discipleship means following the way of life that Jesus has set out for us, using Jesus' life as a model. It was never meant to be a matter of following a set of rules, but rather a matter of being conformed to the image of Christ in every person and in the life of the community of disciples.^[18]</p>
<p>This idea of conformation focuses attention on the direct link with Jesus and his people. The loss of this relationship and this consciousness must surely be catastrophic. Conversely, the rekindling of our relationship with Jesus must surely lead to a recovery of authentic discipleship. The disciple must have a direct, personal experience of Christ as a present reality in his or her life. This is what trusting Jesus is all about. It involves a direct encounter with Jesus, a recognition of his saving work on our behalf, and in a concentrated act of worshipful and grateful response, we give ourselves to him. This does not take place through ecstasy or any religious tour de force (feat of strength) but through faith. It is those who believe in the presence of Christ, who lift themselves not by their 'bootstraps', but by Christ's presence.^[19]</p>
<p>In trying to convey this need for immediacy between believer and Jesus, Kierkegaard coined a rather strange term, <em>contemporaneousness</em>. Although a cumbersome term, it is a useful one because it highlights the need for a direct, personal encounter with Jesus. For the believer, Jesus must be a "living reality, seen through the eyes of faith, a reality that transcends both time and space."^[20] In Kierkegaard's thinking, therefore, contemporaneousness means that the believer must encounter Jesus directly, bypassing the church's entire two-thousand-year tradition and, free of inherited presuppositions, meet Jesus as if for the first time. The believer must stand in the place of the first eyewitnesses (crucifiers as well as disciples), and there, "in the moment of decision," decide whether Jesus is the God-Man who has an absolute claim to his life or a madman who should be ignored.^[21] We need this rather direct appointment with Jesus if we are to be saved and to truly follow him. We must encounter Jesus directly. And it is only through the lifelong imitation of Christ, not just the initial decision to follow him, that we can maintain this contemporaneousness.</p>
<p>Without laboring the point, let us reinforce our conviction that such contemporaneousness is not simply a matter of getting one's theology right (whatever right might mean). Biblical faith cannot be reduced to believing in a set of propositions. As Martin Luther (re)discovered, is more like the supreme gamble in which we stake our whole lives on Jesus. It is a profoundly existential act in which we are fully and personally involved.</p>
<p>Contemporaneousness cannot be attained by speculation but only by the active presence of Christ in my own existence. There is much more to being a disciple than believing and trusting Jesus at the outset; Christianity also involves a well-defined way of existence, a way of life that can be summed up in the phrase "the imitation of Christ." When we choose this way, we take it upon ourselves to be his constant companion, his follower, his contemporary. All the aspects of our discipleship (worship, ritual, prayer, mission, theologizing) are in one sense or another directed toward the achievement of contemporaneousness. Christ's whole life in all its aspects must supply the norm for the life of the following Christian and thus for the life of the whole church.^[22]</p>
<h2>The Who? And the What?</h2>
<p>So what can we use as our flashlight as we travel along this path towards Jesus? There are core truths about Jesus that provide the broad contours of the faith he set for us to journey toward. Understanding these enable us to navigate our way through the complexities of life with the wild and untamable Lord of the church.</p>
<p>The following table provides a summary of some of the key aspects of Jesus' life and teaching and how they might be lived out in the life of the disciple and the church:</p>
<p>| Jesus' Life and Teaching | Implications for Disciple/Church | Examples of How These Could Be Lived Out |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| <strong>Ushers in the kingdom of God</strong> (e.g., Mark 1:14–15; Luke 11:20) | Living under the King (see later chapter on existential monotheism, ch. 5). The kingdom of God is central and extends in and beyond the church to his entire cosmos. We are agents of the kingdom in all spheres of life. Jesus is Lord/King! | We can live and work wherever we are, and we can expect the kingdom to already be there. When we are at work, we invite Jesus to accompany us there. We look for opportunities to enact Jesus' qualities while we are working. We look for ways to mirror the work of God even through the most mundane and everyday activities. |
| <strong>Demands direct trust in God</strong> (e.g., Mark 9:17–20) | Faith as trust demands a distinct form of spiritual openness on our behalf. We should expect God to be involved in all aspects of life common to human being. | Requires a radical openness to the sovereign work of God in the situation, somehow. We must not give in to our fears. We refuse to give up when a situation seems hopeless, trusting that God is at work in the situation, somehow. |
| <strong>Offers grace and mercy</strong> (e.g., Matt 12:7) | We must be agents of grace in our midst. Whether someone is divorced, an ex-convict, disabled, or even just needy or annoying, we humbly accept their gifts to us as if they were from God. | We must try to find ways to be like God in daily life. We show mercy to others. The measure we give will be the measure we receive. We give generously with both our resources and our time. |
| <strong>Offers forgiveness of sins</strong> (e.g., Matt 9:2; Luke 7:47) | Repentance and forgiveness are a way of life (70x7). Radical openness to a holy God will require that we be constantly aware of our sinfulness and the possibility of radical evil that lurks in the human soul. Also, we must be a forgiving people (Matt 6:15). | We examine ourselves carefully for any bitterness or lack of forgiveness toward others. We place ourselves in relationships of accountability. We are open to the rebuke of the loving friend. We confess our limitations regularly. |
| <strong>Demonstrates the love of God for his world</strong> (e.g., John 3:16; 1 John 4:7–21) | Demands our primary love for God and a love for others that reflects God's love. We need to know we are a loved people, and this should include but extend beyond our family and friends. We should be known as a people of love. | Our loves shows God's love. We love others and do so reflecting on the way it is received from God. We practice hospitality. We create spaces in which others can grow and flourish. |
| <strong>Heals the sick and casts out demons</strong> (e.g., Mark 1:21–28; 5:1–20) | Healing ministry should be part of the kingdom's presence (John 14:12). We look for opportunities to heal people in body, mind, and spirit. We must not shrink back in spiritual warfare when necessary. | We look for opportunities to pray for healing with people. We must not shrink back in spiritual warfare when necessary. |
| <strong>Calls us to follow and imitate him</strong> (e.g., Matt 4:19; 16:24) | Jesus is not only Savior but also God's pattern for authentic humanity. Discipleship is an imitation of Jesus... discipleship. It requires that we follow his way of life and stand with Jesus and his cause even when it means suffering and martyrdom. It will also mean we are willing to go against the flow and stand with Jesus and his cause. | We volunteer at a homeless shelter and talk with the clients, even if their stories are uncomfortable. We stand with the marginalized even when our Christian friends think this isn't a good use of our time. |
| <strong>Introduces a new ethic</strong> (e.g., Matt 5–7) | The Sermon on the Mount is the most important discipleship text in the history of the church. It provides a moral code for the disciple/church to follow. The humility, compassion, and justice. We believe that the kingdom is not only about salvation but a motivation for justice and peace of God. | We challenge our faith community to live by the standards Jesus would approve of, even if we go against the flow and status quo. We are known as a people who follow Jesus and not that we are particularly religious. We are known to many non-Christians. |
| <strong>Shows love and concern for the poor and marginalized</strong> (e.g., Matt 25:31–46; Luke 4:18–19) | We must serve the marginalized and outcast. This will mean we sometimes stand in direct opposition to the forces of oppression—be they political, economic, or religious. | We work with a group that helps HIV/AIDS victims even when our Christian friends think this isn't a good use of our time. We stand with the oppressed even when it is uncomfortable. |
| <strong>Welcomes the outcast and creates fellowship</strong> (e.g., Matt 9:9–12; Luke 15:1–2) | We must be known for our welcome of the stranger, the outcast, and the marginalized. We must create fellowship based on cultural preferences. | We welcome visitors to our church who do not look like us. We spend time with "freaks" and outcasts and look for what they can teach us about Jesus. There is something we have to learn from the margins of society that we cannot learn from the center. |
| <strong>Proclaims (as well as lives) the good news of the kingdom</strong> (e.g., Matt 4:23; 9:35) | We should proclaim (as well as live) good news of Jesus. In a sense we are (and must become) good news. (We are salt/light.) Love, forgiveness, mercy, compassion, righteous anger... these are the marks of a disciple. | We socialize with unbelievers. We pray with them. We model an alternate reality by our alternate lifestyle. We are always ready to give an answer for the hope within us. We acknowledge the ministry of the gifted evangelists among us. |
| <strong>Follows the pattern of God's redemption</strong> (e.g., Luke 15:4–32) | We must act redemptively because God is a redeemer. We restore what has been lost or broken. Mission involves the redemption of broken people and lost culture. We don't judge, we redeem. God is our Redeemer. | We aim at restoration and beauty, creativity and grace, hospitality and generosity. We live, love, play, and suffer, better than anyone else, for God is our Redeemer. |
| <strong>Calls for whole-life devotion</strong> (e.g., Matt 22:37–40) | We cannot compartmentalize our lives in ways that divide our total devotion to God. We must love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. This is an existential call to believe with our heads or our bodies. The love But we direct them towards God, etc. We cannot compartmentalize our lives in to us in the first place. We engage intellectually, emotionally, and bodily in the life God has given us. | We integrate our faith into all aspects of life. We don't separate our "spiritual" life from our "secular" life. We see all of life as sacred. |
| <strong>Offers new beginnings</strong> (e.g., John 3:1–7; Luke 7:38–50) | We must be born again. We are the people of the new start! We must offer new starts to others. Give people a go. Learn to actively forgive. | We remember that we have received forgiveness and that others need it as well. We tell others of Jesus' gift of a new start and a life with God. |
| <strong>Hates hypocrisy</strong> (e.g., Matt 23:1–36) | In Jesus' teaching, self-righteousness is abhorred! Mentioned far more than sexual sin. We must be humble disciples of Jesus. We have been forgiven of much, so we must extend grace to others. | We listen humbly when others point out our faults. We remember not to judge others. We extend grace to others. Jesus said more about these than about sexual sin. |
| <strong>Is coming again</strong> (e.g., Luke 21; Rev 22:20) | An adoring and expectant longing for his presence and return (like a betrothed virgin awaiting her bridegroom) should characterize us. He also comes in judgment on those who reject him. He was crucified yesterday, was raised today, and is coming tomorrow. | We hold on to a sense of Jesus' return and our need to live urgently. We live with a sense of expectancy and hope. |
| <strong>Lays down life for friends</strong> (e.g., John 15:13) | Calls us to self-sacrificial lifestyle. We are called to be servants to a lost and broken world (Matt 23:11–12). | We decide to give up a luxury—perhaps cable TV, dinners out, or cell phone games—and give the money to a good cause. We look for ways to serve others sacrificially. |
| <strong>Brings salvation</strong> (e.g., Luke 1:76–77; 19:9) | We need to be saved. This is not only a past event but an ongoing reality. Also, we are the messengers of salvation with all the rich connotations of healing and wholeness. We hold on to the idea of salvation as a daily basis. | We hold on to the idea of salvation as an ongoing reality. We are agents of God's saving work in the world. |</p>
<p>We don't believe this list is exhaustive, nor do we think that it is even an adequate summary of the faith that has captured the hearts and imaginations of hundreds of millions over two thousand years of history. In fact, we encourage readers to work through the implications of Jesus and his teaching for themselves. It's a great exercise to do with a small group or on one's own.</p>
<h2>Following Missional Jesus</h2>
<p>Scot McKnight, biblical scholar and blogger, has done something similar with his blog series called "Missional Jesus." He draws no conclusions as to how we ought to live as followers, but we believe that it should be reasonably clear how Jesus acted and affected those around him—readers can draw their own conclusions. Here is our summary/excerpting of the series.^[23]</p>
<p>| Bible Text Examined | Subject of Blog Entry |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| <strong>Luke 4:16–30</strong> | • Missional Jesus publicly announces the centrality of himself to the mission of God (4:21).• Missional Jesus sees his own mission in Isaiah 61:1–2, that means his mission involves justice for the poor, prisoners, the blind, and the oppressed.• The mission of Jesus is a Jubilee mission (4:19).• The mission of Jesus creates disturbances and rejection (4:24).• The mission of Jesus will extend beyond the normal boundaries. |
| <strong>Luke 5:1–11</strong> | • Missional Jesus is a preacher of the word (5:1–3).• Encountering the missional Jesus brings bewilderment, wonder, and awe—leading to repentance (5:5, 8, 9–10).• Missional Jesus shares his mission with those who are attached to him (5:10).• Those who encounter missional Jesus leave everything to join the mission of Jesus (5:11). |
| <strong>Luke 9:57–62</strong> | • Missional Jesus knows the cost to the body (9:58).• Missional Jesus knows the cost to the family life when it comes to sacred customs (9:59–60).• Missional Jesus knows the cost to the family life when it comes to simple social courtesies (9:61–62).• Missional Jesus wants all from his followers, he wants them to make that decision now, and he demands all because he knows the kingdom of God is worth it. |
| <strong>Matthew 4:23–25</strong> | • Overall, missional Jesus did what was good for others.• Missional Jesus taught in typical centers of religious education.• Missional Jesus proclaimed the kingdom of God. What is the kingdom of God? Kingdom for Jesus is the presence and power of God breaking into human history.• Missional Jesus healed. |
| <strong>Matthew 8:5–13</strong> | • Missional Jesus accepts anyone who comes to him for healing.• Missional Jesus breaks down boundaries between Gentiles and Jews.• Missional Jesus believes that what mattered was faith in God (through Jesus) and not ethnic heritage and religious association.• Missional Jesus lauds the perception of faith in him as faith in the One who is sent by God with authority. |
| <strong>Mark 5:1–20</strong> | • Missional Jesus confronts the evil at home in persons ravaged by evil spirits.• The evil world recognizes missional Jesus as a threat of power.• Missional Jesus can deliver people from evil, and everyone who perceives turns into a follower of Jesus.• Missional Jesus summons those released from evil to witness to the mercy he [the Lord] has shown them.• Missional Jesus knows his mission is a spiritual battle. |
| <strong>Matthew 9:32–34</strong> | • Missional Jesus attracts those who are possessed by evil—the way flames attract moths.• Missional Jesus, therefore, attracts folks who know that Jesus can heal them.• Missional Jesus can flat-out cure folks.• Missional Jesus creates such a disturbance that some religious leaders call him demon-possessed. |
| <strong>Matthew 9:35–10:4</strong> | • Missional Jesus participates in the mission of God.• Missional Jesus therefore prays to God for "extenders" of his mission-working kingdom of God.• Missional Jesus prays because he is moved by oppression and the need for mercy on so many.• Missional Jesus specifically identifies 12 workers for the kingdom and appoints them as his personal representatives in the kingdom work.• Missional Jesus appoints his "extenders" to do what he has been doing in Matthew. They are therefore extenders of Jesus and not doers of their own mission. Missional work is Jesus work.• Not all of Jesus' "extenders" follow Jesus faithfully. |
| <strong>Matthew 10:5–15</strong> | • Missioners of the missional Jesus have one message: God's kingdom.• Missioners do what Jesus said. They are to "be" Jesus in a new place in order to extend Jesus and his mission. |</p>
<p>What we can say is that without qualification, the Gospels present us with the most compelling portrait of a person who was so wonderfully human, and yet one who lifted us up beyond the merely human and has shown us the way to God. This is the Jesus we love and adore. We will not let go! And we refuse to subvert this life in the petty concerns of institutional maintenance or personal comfort. We will do anything in our strength to assure that in his church, he is named as Lord.</p>
<p>Another voice singing from this same song-sheet is Irish songwriter Sinéad O'Connor, who in 2007 released her album <em>Theology</em>, an anthology of songs expressing a faith not stained by the church that bears God's name. Raised Catholic, the singer has been critical of the institutional church, but the sting in her beautiful songs can be felt by any church or denomination that has lost its way. In "Out of the Depths," she captures the psalmist's brokenhearted cry for mercy. It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of the depths I cry to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her song she imagines this lament being sung for a God who is locked out of his own church. The song closes with the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it's sad but true how the old saying goes
If you want to learn about God, you've got to go to the cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a line! To truly understand God we must see him as the humbled one, the crucified one, the one who died on the gentle slope of Golgotha. Sinéad ends the song by breathlessly repeating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I long for you as watchmen long for the end of night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is our longing, too.</p>
<p>Renewal will begin with each of us. But like the conspiracy of the little Jesuses, it will have consequences for the renewal of the church as a whole.</p>
<p>And to that subject we now turn our attention.</p>
