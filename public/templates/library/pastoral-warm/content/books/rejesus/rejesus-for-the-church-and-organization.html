<h1>ReJesus for the Church and Organization</h1>

<p>Christ’s whole life in all its aspects must supply the
norm for the life of the following Christian and thus for
the life of the whole Church.
—Søren Kierkegaard</p>
<p>All religious institutional embeddedness—whether in the form of temple worship, unjust social systems, or repressive religious practices—is challenged by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:20, we hear these famous words of Jesus: “Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come
in to you and eat with you, and you with me.” We generally interpret this to
to come in. Even though we can appreciate the sentiment, the verse itself
in Revelation 3 is that in Laodicea, the famously lukewarm church that Jesus
side of the church asking to come in. The question that should spring to our
be the Lord of that very church?” But of course, John’s revelation of the seven
the same errors. Jesus is outside the door of the church in Laodicea! How is
Christian? The question we ask in introducing this chapter must be, is Jesus
ship of the insiders? And what has been the result?</p>
<h2>ReJesusing Our Organizations</h2>
<p>As is now clear, our basic assumption is that Jesus provides the primary template for us as individual followers but also for the church as the
community that is in Christ and that walks in his way. As stated earlier, we
recalibrate, to test whether we are indeed in the faith. The inference is that by
degrees lost touch with the wild and dangerous message that it carries and
Christlike life, and no matter how we configure it, that must surely mean that
with the life, teachings, and mission of Jesus. The degree that we are living
can call ourselves authentic disciples.
This might well sound like idealism to some more pragmatically inclined readers, and perhaps rightly. They may well point out the fact that as
comprising thousands of organizations with massive capital and resources.</p>
<p>And there is no denying that such organizations do manage to help many people and bring many to faith. Therefore, they might consider it an indulgence on our part to be prattling on about the radical life of Jesus when, whether we like it or not, we are now obligated to maintain those religious organizations with their associated programs, paid professionals, ideologies, capital, buildings, and so on. Theirs is a call to pragmatism over radicalism, although, we suspect, in more honest moments many of them would probably admit that much that we do seems to have only an indirect correlation to the uncluttered, nonreligious, life-oriented faith so compellingly portrayed in the Gospels. These objectors might, in spite of their deepest spiritual intuitions, simply say that we have no choice but to continue to operate the services and maintain the system or else the whole edifice might crumble.</p>
<p>And others still might add the fact that along with the institution of the
church we have long and complex histories that have shaped us, carried us,
and landed us where we are today. They would suggest that we are indeed

<p>Running programs and services and/or guiding the laity through liturgical complexities in order to help people get to the God they are all meant to access directly through Jesus anyhow? Was this what Jesus had in mind when he established the church (Matt 16:18–19)?1 And, whatever happened to the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers that many within the Protestant movements are meant to adhere to (1 Pet 2:9)?</p>
<p>We are not insensitive to the fact that a great many people feel connected to Jesus via the stained-glass imagination of grand ecclesiastical
traditions. Nor do we dispute that contemporary-style seeker churches have
faith. It would be ignorant of us to do so. God is everywhere, and his grace is</p>

such as Jesus of Montreal, Chocolat, and As It Is in Heaven are not attacks on Jesus.</p>
<p>They are scathing critiques of institutional Christianity, but they all portray their messianic-like protagonists with great sympathy, even reverence.</p>
<p>The most allegorical of them, the Canadian film Jesus of Montreal, depicts

The message these films seem to be making was also expressed by</p>
<p>anthropologist Margaret Mead, when she wrote, “Never doubt that a small

missional movements and how they center on Jesus:
The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its element is a very
simple thing. It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great
and that of a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the
faith which uniting a man to Christ, sets him on fire.3

<p>This process of going back to our generative center will mean a process of rediscovering Jesus afresh. We need to re Jesus our organizations.</p>
<p>Christianity Minus Christ Equals Religion
In order to get to the nub of the problem, let’s reverse the way of looking at the process of re Jesus: let us think about what happens when you take
equation:
Christianity - Christ = Religion</p>
<p>It makes sense, doesn’t it? Some statements have an immediate ring
of truth about them, and for many Christians this is one of them. Of course,
Christianity without the lifeblood, the vision, the love of the real Jesus is a
the word “religion” in rather negative sense—as a set of inherited rituals,
tends to be quite oppressive and controlling. And this is how we mean it here.</p>
<p>The removal of Jesus from the faith does result in the rise of religious consciousness and institutional expression. Astudy in European church history will more than adequately prove this point. The Inquisition was not a freak of history but rather was the logical result of a highly coercive and controlling religion that had lost sight of its reason for existence—had lost contact with its founder. But how does this happen? How does a movement as vital as that of early Christianity find itself having drifted so far from its foundation? This is not so mysterious a matter. In fact, it can be readily explained by the sociology of religion. Sociologists recognize that the fading of the initial founding impulse of a movement is not unique to Christianity but is true of all religious expressions. Sociologists call this the routinization of charisma and say it accounts for the decline of religious organizations and people movements.</p>
<p>What happens in the beginning of a movement is that the people encounter the divine in a profound and revelatory way, but with successive generations this encounter tends to fade like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy.</p>
<p>What begins as a revolutionary, life-transforming, confrontation with Jesus eventually subsides into a codified religion and is subsequently incorporated into normal social life.</p>
<p>And herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for all people of faith: Although
genuine faith is born out of direct encounters with God, it cannot survive and
prosper without some form of stability and order. Viewed positively, rituals,
God. In fact, we believe this is what they initially were designed for. But unfade and the ritual, creeds, and rules intended to preserve the encounter will
match the inward experience and spiritual condition of the participants. At
and constant renewals become necessary... hence the need to re Jesus.
It is, as O’Dea says, a dilemma born of the tragedy inherent in the</p>
<p>human condition in a fallen world. But for the disciple, the simple truth must
encounter in rituals, priesthoods, and theological formulas. We all need to</p>
<p>The same is true for our defining relationship with Jesus. It is like the story of the Israelites in the wilderness. They tried to store up the manna from heaven for another day. Religion can give into the same temptation to try to store up and rely on the souvenirs of a past spiritual experience. For how many years did the church rely on the system of holy Christian relics—a bone from Peter’s finger, a wooden shard from the cross of Christ, cathedrals and sacred buildings, inherited rituals, even creedal formulas, more than it relied on a fresh, daily encounter with Jesus? We, like Israel, are called to be willing to collect the fresh manna every day—and we are to do this without becoming spiritual thrill seekers but rather lifelong worshipers. To do otherwise is to “outsource your encounter with Jesus” to a religious system of souvenirs, ritual, and religious paraphernalia. Said Maurice Friedman:</p>
<p>Theophany happens to man, and he has his part in it as God has His. [Religious]
an idea but God. [Genuine] religious reality means this; it is the undiminished</p>
<p>The more one replaces a fresh daily encounter with Jesus with religious
forms, over time he is removed from his central place in the life of the church.</p>
<p>The result of this removal (by whatever means) is the onset of dead religion in the place of a living faith.5 And to be honest, much of what has gone under the name Christendom can readily be called religion and not Christianity as defined by the Bible. Centuries ago, Blaise Pascal uttered these incisive words about the spiritual condition of the Christianity of his day: “Christendom is a union of people who, by means of the sacraments, excuse themselves from their duty to love God.”6 And while religious people tend to be sincere, they do use religion to qualify the God experience–to soften it and control it. One of the functions of religion, sociologically speaking, includes that of avoiding God. All attempts to reduce the faith to intellectualism, or to condition our understanding of God, or to domesticate Jesus, or to diminish the call to lifelong discipleship will result in the loss of the God experience and the encroachment of some form of religion. Anglican missiologist John V. Taylor says, “We need not go all the way with Karl Barth in defining all religion as unbelief. But... it is plain that man uses religion as a way of escaping from God. This is true of Christianity as of any other religious system.”7 And it was yet another Anglican who rightly said, “Jesus was inaugurating a way of life which had no further need of the Temple.”8 Any attempt then to reconstruct a temple theology of church goes clean contrary to the work of Jesus. He is the new temple.</p>
<p>Martin Buber, the great articulator of dialogical Hebraic spirituality,
says that what were originally the true forms of the God encounter soon deteriorate and then become obstacles or substitutes for God. We do very well</p>
<p>The ur-danger of man is “religion” and mystic ecstasy. It may be that the forms... then they eventually cease to embody the consecration of the lived, everyworld and religious service then begin to run on unapproachably parallel lines.

<h2>Christianity as Antireligion</h2>
<p>As we are thinking about the dangers of formulaic religion, it might be
useful to take a look at the Pharisees. Most readers of the New Testament
would agree that the Pharisees are often portrayed as the bad guys and not
Pharisees. What do we know about them?
Well, from the Bible and from historical research, we can say that</p>
<p>33 They were very sincere in their belief system.

33 They prayed arduously and often with set prayers prescribed for

world’s) redemption.
We would be wrong to characterize Pharisees as mean-spirited people</p>
<p>with nothing but evil on their minds. Generally they were sincere and welldaism of Jesus’ time was, they were nonetheless exemplary religious people</p>

we inhabit the theology we adhere to—how we believe it. Divorced from love,</p>
<p>And here again Jesus is the key. Without the active love for, and presence of, the radical Jesus, Christianity easily degenerates into an oppressive religion.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the Christendom project is full of atrocities perpetrated in the name of religion; the Inquisition and the Crusades stand out, but they were not isolated incidents. One can even argue that it is partly from the snares of religion that Jesus came to save us. We do well to remember the judgment that came upon the legalistic moralism that the Judaism at the time of Jesus had degenerated into. The parables of judgment have ongoing validity to all religious people, not just the scribes and the Pharisees.</p>
<p>While teaching at a seminary in the American Bible Belt, Alan once
posed the question, “What would we do with Jesus if he turned up at our
churches?” One brave soul answered with heart-stopping honesty, “We would

<h2>The Founder and the Found</h2>
<p>Part of the basis to this claim comes from an understanding of the
defining role that Jesus plays for the movement that sprang from his life
and work. In all people-movements, including religious movements, there
ment that forms from the work and teachings of that person. In some rare
founder, taking on a broader vision or a new philosophical base while still
it has evolved from the original suffragettes to modern-day feminism). But
link between the founder and the found is critical for the health of ChristianMax Weber, the famous sociologist, was one of the first to broker these
insights when he described the role of the “charismatic leader” in the founding of a movement. The charismatic leader in his view is distinguished from
self or herself. And the source of this authority exists apart from any status
movements, particularly religious movements that survive beyond the first
who in a crisis situation puts forward a radically alternative vision of the world
that vision. This annunciation of a radical vision and mission subsequently
encounters that further validate the charismatic’s mission. And so we find
radical message of the founder.14
The point we make in referring to Weber here is that he rightly understood the critical factors that made for significant people movements and</p>

<p>the founder as decisive, not only for the initiation of the religious movement

fact, he argues that this is an unavoidable paradox for religious movements.18
without those structures taking on a life of their own and corrupting what
religious experiences of themselves will not sustain a religious movement.
And herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for religious organizations: although religious movements are born out of firsthand religious experiences,
charism (the originating grace or gift) has to be diffused, ritualized, and mediaccessible through the organization itself. While O’Dea saw this process of

Weber maintained that the process of institutionalization and renewal</p>
<p>involved a constant return to the charismatic center in order to relegitimize,
religious organizations require a form of renewal that requires a return to the
a denomination or to Christianity as a whole, one can call this rediscovery of
the organization’s deepest tradition and reinterpreting it for a new context.
In fact, there is a certain way of thinking and acting within an organization that can be traced back to its founder. This is called the organization’s</p>
<p>33 The beliefs, values, and assumptions of its founders
33 The validation of these beliefs through the learning experiences
of the group
33 The enhancement of these beliefs by the new beliefs, values, and
assumptions brought by new group members.
But we can say categorically that the impact of the founder is the most</p>
<p>important factor in determining the resultant culture of an organization or
church, or simply re Jesus.
In the formation of Christianity we can clearly see all these forces at</p>
<p>work. In the New Testament (even the word “new” implies a departure from,
people had previously understood and experienced the kingdom of God. As
bypassing the religious institution that has inadvertently begun to block its
access for the people, for all who would draw near (e. g., Matt 11:28–30; 21:43;

gion that takes its cue from him. We also know from the Gospels that Jesus
the ways of the kingdom and to discipling and teaching them to recognize
means to be a disciple are thus built into the system at its inception.
It was Peter Berger who alerted us to the fact that reality is in fact socially constructed. The social process is exactly how leaders get their ideas
the form of commands, as we can see in some aspects of Jesus’ teaching.</p>
<p>But they are generally passed on to the followers through a combination of socialization, through the charismatic power of the founder, and by acting, by doing, by living out confidence in the message.</p>
<p>They knew they were bound to his teaching and template. Any apostolic
development of the teachings of Jesus are authentic only insofar that they
refer directly to the person, and extend the work of, Jesus. They are all bound
speculate beyond that. They can, however, interpret Jesus and his teachings
and evolves, but the nascent ethos of the founder is maintained. This is expractice was given to us by Paul who spent his best energies in establishing
the Messiah, in terms of both his person (e. g., Ephesians and Colossians) and
by the revelation given in and through Jesus (Gal 1:8; Col 1:15–20; 1 Cor 3:11;

Early on, the original church had cause to recalibrate to Jesus. The original believers were largely Jews, and The Way was considered a sect under

generation the Christian movement was already forced back to its founder to

and mission of the church is all about.

<p>This must surely partly be what it means to live “in Christ” and he in us. Observers should be able to encounter Jesus in and through the life and community of his followers. People observing us ought to be able to discern the elements of Jesus’ way in our ways. If they cannot find authentic signals of the historical Jesus through the life of his people, then as far as we are concerned they have the full right to question our legitimacy.</p>
<p>Tony Campolo tells the story of a drunk who was miraculously converted at a Bowery mission in New York. Like all Campolo stories, it has a
jokey punch line that betrays a far more serious and convicting point.
The drunk, Joe, was known throughout the Bowery as the worst kind</p>
<p>of wino, a hopeless derelict of a man, living on borrowed time. But followthat anyone associated with the mission had ever known. He spent his days
mopped up vomit and urine and cleaned up drunks whatever their condition.</p>
<p>He considered nothing too demeaning for him.</p>
<p>One evening, when the director of the mission was delivering his evening evangelistic message to the usual crowd of still and sullen men, their
heads hung in penitence and exhaustion, there was one man who looked up,
him to change. The repentant drunk kept shouting, “Oh God, make me like
over and said to the man, “Son, I think it would be better if you prayed, ‘Make
on his face and asked, “Is he like Joe?”21
The New Testament writers likewise call people to emulate their example, knowing that they had committed their lives to Jesus and that he incommitment to the embodiment of Jesus’ message to be able to say “follow
his example. This might seem like arrogance to us, but, like the ex-drunk in

For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we
