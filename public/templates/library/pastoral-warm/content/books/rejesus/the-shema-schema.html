<h1>The Shema Schema (One God, One Love)</h1>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Monotheism is a outcome of the exclusive claim of
Yahweh, rather than a conceptual hypothesis resulting
from human effort to gain a unitary view of his world.
—Paul Minear</p>
<p>R. Joshua ben Korba said: Why does the section
“Hear, O Israel” (Deut 6:4–9) precede the section
“And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken
may first take upon himself the yoke of the kingdom
yoke of the commandments.</p>
<p>All this talk about Jesus, discipleship, and the church raises a whole set of
questions relating to a broader understanding of God. Where is the place</p>
<p>of God in a discussion on Christology and the missional church? We mean
the discussion within the most fundamental revelation of God in the Bible,
all other claims for ultimate loyalty. In effect, we are going to look at biblical
well as some of the practical outworkings of it for life and faith. Monotheism,
Lord and Creator of all, has rightful claim to sovereignty over all that he has
way of expressing the claim of the one God over all creation.
The reader might well be tempted to dismiss this chapter as being overly</p>
<p>theological and therefore choose to skip it to get to the more practical stuff.</p>
<p>We believe this would be a serious mistake, not because the practical isn’t important but because so much of the practical stuff is bound up directly with our understanding of God. This goes to the issue of worldview—if we go wrong on monotheism, our most elemental view of God, the whole enterprise is threatened. We ought to be mindful once again of William Temple’s warnings about the nature of theological error when he noted that if our conception of God is radically false, then the more devout we are the worse it will be for us. We believe that the fundamental correction for the church at the dawn of the twenty-first century must be a christological one that will in turn revolutionize our missiology as well as our ecclesiology. But we must be patient, and we need to be as accurate as we can, because when one is journeying to the moon, one degree off at launch and we will miss it by thousands of miles.</p>
<p>If this is not already obvious, this theological corrective must take place in the realm of Christology. But to understand Christology properly, we need to probe the most basic assumption in the biblical revelation of God, namely, the assumption that God is One and that he redeems and claims us in and through Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<h2>One God</h2>
<p>The representative text on this topic is what Jewish people call the
Shema. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
that there are no greater commandments than these (Mark 12:31).
The word shema is the first word in the text of Deuteronomy 6:4–9, and</p>
<p>it means “hear” or “ pay attention.” This call to attention highlights what folrelationship to the people of God (and it is that). It also contains within it the
way of ethical living with a distinct understanding of God. The Shema also
deeply personal and well-defined connection between God and the people
thus highlighting its nature as a prototypal summary of biblical faith. This
that is basic to Jewish faith, is assumed by all the writers of the New TestaThis concept of the oneness of God represents a striking contrast to
that of the religious thought of the cultures that surrounded Israel where the
multiplicity of gods in turn led to great upheaval and tension in human life.</p>
<p>For polytheists, though a person might carry out his religious duties with care, he or she could not be guaranteed any security, for if there was strife among the gods, this would radically affect human life. Though a given god might promise much to the individual person, a more powerful god might still bring disaster. The resulting tension often led to a deep pessimism in religious life and thought. This is not as theoretical as it sounds at first. The average modern polytheists-next-door also lack an integrating center of life.</p>
<p>They live under the rules of economics, nationalism, sex, family, and whatever other idols they set up. And make no mistake; these are idols that can dominate a person’s life and consciousness. History is clear about that. People will kill for these if necessary. These idols compete with one another and demand loyalty and obeisance, but they can never deliver ultimate meaning to life. Because life is fragmented, distributed among the many, it therefore allows no unified vision of reality to emerge. In radical contrast to the belief in many gods, Yahweh is the one and only God who redeems his people and subsequently requires that they love him as he had already loved them.1 And the nature of this God and the form this love of God should take is made known to us in Scripture, nature, and history. He is good, holy, just, and compassionate, and he requires us to be the same. To be in relationship with him therefore brings meaning, focus, moral vision, and an ultimate reality to human life.</p>
<p>This revelation of God as One speaks not only of the uniqueness of God
(over against the many) but also the unity within God and therefore the world
God has created. The God of the universe is the God of history. We assert that
clearly motivates and inspires the faith of the New Testament. Monotheistic

<p>Wilberforce helped launch a new phase of the campaign and sought to end human slavery for good. Exhausted by the campaign and the parlous state of his health, Wilberforce retired in 1825.</p>
<p>In 1833 he received news of the impending passing of the Slavery Abolition Act. “Thank God that I should have lived to witness a day in which England is willing to give twenty million pounds for the abolition of slavery,” he is quoted as saying. He died two days later. As a little Jesus, Wilberforce is commended for his unstinting effort to abolish slavery and promote equality among races in a turbulent time.</p>
<p>In Mark 12:28–34, Jesus responds to a question about the greatest commandment by directly quoting the Shema (Deut 6:4–5), thus affirming the primacy
of monotheistic faith. Yet the fullness of this quotation, with its emphasis

<p>Our view of God is that Jesus is Lord, and the kingdom of God is the arena
in which we respond to God’s sovereign rule over this world. All is included
(and nothing is excluded) in this claim. Once again the all-encompassing</p>

ethic. Anything less and it is not a biblical view of God.
For instance, Mark Sayers, comrade and commentator on culture and</p>
<p>the gospel, suggests that while the vast majority of people in Western condistant and their idea of him/her/it is so vague that it fails to generate any

<p>Recall chapter 4, where we discussed the various images that Christians entertain of Jesus. Now apply these images (e. g., bearded-lady Jesus, spooky Jesus, or the iddy-baby Jesus of Talladega Nights) to the top of the diagram above. It is not hard to see the impact that this will have on life. For instance, there is</p>

this is a false and profoundly consumerist one.
So what does true spirituality as response look like? How do we love</p>
<p>the Lord with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and pass that spirituality on
22:37–40)? Allow us to suggest a couple of broad ways.
Spirituality Beyond the Sacred and Secular</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of a truly monotheistic view of the world is the annihilation of the dualistic category of sacred and secular. If one God is the source
of reality and the reference point for life, how can life be fragmented? When we
areas... secular? But this is a tempting thing because integrating life under the
theists. Paul Minear suggests that the biblical writers constantly fight
against a false separation of sacred from secular, against any reduction in the
territory under divine rule. It has often been observed that in neither Testament can ethics and religion be separated. One finds an ethical religion and
a religious ethic precisely because every aspect of life is seen from a single
se religious.14
Glocal (combining global with local) apostle Bob Roberts refers to the</p>
<p>domains of our lives and asserts that the kingdom extends to all the domains
ily).15 He sees that mission must entail an engagement in each and every
that would be to limit the activity of the kingdom to that of the church. And
whole cosmos, including the human and all the domains of human society.</p>
<p>Clearly there can be no false sacred-secular divide here. One of the tasks of the church, says Roberts, is to learn how to engage in all of life in order to transform the world.</p>
<p>We’ve segmented [our understanding of] how God works. And we’ve done so to
our own detriment. Only when we see the bigger picture of how the pieces fit
together can there be any flow or continuity. I call this way of learning, domain
separate... instead of learning and mastering only one domain or specialty for
domain. We’re curious. We want to know how it all relates; instead of camping</p>
<p>Glocalnet, Robert’s training organization, uses what it calls a domain map to help teach church planters to know how to engage society on a practical level. The key is to help people see that their job or vocation puts them in a domain and that is, at the same time, their chief ministry. This breakthrough in terms of our understanding of God’s rule in the world and our role in it only highlights how we have failed to fully comprehend the all-encompassing nature of monotheism, whereas Judaism has understood this all along.</p>
<p>When we associate this idea to the christological redefinition of monotheism (as we must), then our task in the world is to be Jesus’ agents in every
sphere or domain of society. The lordship of Jesus extends to our sexuality,
in between. There must be no limitation to the claim that Jesus makes over all
is Lord” is more like a rallying war cry than a mere theological statement.</p>
<h2>Oneness to the One</h2>
<p>Judaism has well understood the nature and implications of existential
monotheism, and the heart of Jewish spirituality is directly tied to the Shema.</p>
<p>Jewish people know that if God is one and that all of life comes under that claim of the one God, then the only true response is that we give all of life to God as our true act of worship. They call this task yichud, or unification, and it involves taking all of the disparate elements in one’s life and offering them up to God. No sphere or domain or aspect of human existence is to be kept out of this equation; politics, economics, family life, religious life, all are directed toward the One. In this offering, all idolatries are renounced, no domain is seen as autonomous, all motivations are to be redeemed and directed toward God, and in so doing the worshipper unifies his or her own existence.</p>
<p>This is true holiness (Rom 12:1–3).</p>
<p>Seen in this light we can say that the heart of a genuinely biblical spirituality is found in response to the holy claim of Oneness. For us, as for the
Israelite, worship, discipleship, and mission are rolled into the one act of uniyet another reworking of our basic diagram, we can illustrate this as follows.</p>

In this diagram, we see the affirmation of God and the redemptive claim</p>
<p>of God, mediated through Jesus Christ. Our response to that claim is that
through Jesus. Here we have the spiritual meaning of worship, discipleship,</p>
<p>Therefore, worship as the Bible characterizes it cannot be limited to singing praise and worship songs to God. Although it includes this, it is far more
all-encompassing than that. Worship is nothing less than offering our whole lives
(family, friendships, money, work, nation, etc.) and presenting them back to
discipleship if it is not the same type of action? Surely, discipleship is taking
Jesus. But the discerning reader would immediately notice that this sounds

<p>This is what constitutes the biblical idea of holiness—the redemption of the everyday and of everything; oneness in response to the One.</p>

and love of God through him. And our love of God is offered through him. This
precisely here that Christology comes to the fore yet again. It focuses our al-</p>
<h2>Idolatrous Views of Jesus</h2>
<p>Clearly this calls forth a response involving the whole person—what
the Bible describes as an offering of the heart. Monotheistic faith has to do
with the surrender of the heart. To ask and answer the question, “What is the
“God,” understood rightly, demands ultimate allegiance. This is what the first
ent in the human condition. The claim of the one true God is set against the
idolatrous view of god overshadowing the true monotheism. Our response is</p>

<p>Only the true God can give unity, wholeness, and security to a human
being. Therefore, the human heart, to be true to its original purpose, should
have only one God. But we resist the all-encompassing claim and seek to find
heart to the God of Israel and Jesus Christ or to an idol. In the language of God, the one and only God, can be the object of our ultimate concern, since only the one God is ultimate. Without a living monotheistic faith, a person’s life will inevitably be fragmentary. To paraphrase Yeats, things fall apart, the center does not hold.</p>
<p>Idolatry is insidious; it plays upon our deepest insecurities, appeals
to our fearfulness, and therefore nourishes our fallen instinct to flee from

<p>Any chapter exploring monotheism must look at how Jesus changes,

between the one God of the Scriptures and Jesus the Messiah is properly

It is clear from the New Testament that Jesus fundamentally alters the</p>

This is the meaning of the traditional assertion that Jesus is the Word of God.

Jesus. To argue from God to Jesus instead of arguing from Jesus to God is to put

<p>The implications of this intratrinitarian shift within the revelation of God
are paradigmatic. Executive lordship is now conferred directly on Jesus, and
with this shift comes a realignment of the believer’s focus and loyalties. So
is Jesus who sets Christianity apart from the other two monotheistic faiths,
the prism of Jesus Christ. We cannot understand God if we don’t engage him</p>
<p>This redefinition of biblical monotheism around the role of Jesus can
be called Christocentric monotheism, because it realigns our loyalties to God
around the person and work of Jesus Christ. Jesus thus becomes the pivotal
and loyalty. Jesus is Lord! And this lordship is expressed in exactly the same
lives, the unshakable center of the Christian creed and confession.38

Now, it’s not really true, but it does highlight the role that Jesus plays</p>
<p>in redefining the people of God. Jesus changes everything, and this is critical</p>

<p>Few people have embodied the role of a little Jesus quite as sublimely
she was eighteen she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin, Ireland,
high school in Calcutta, India (known today as Kolkata). In 1948,
in Calcutta, she received permission to leave her teaching position
children, relying on volunteer and financial support. Two years later
Mother Teresa</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was granted permission to start her own order, aiming
to care for “the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those
people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a
of the Calcutta Diocese by the Vatican, the order began with only thirteen members in Calcutta.</p>
<p>Today it is known as the Missionaries of Charity and consists of more than 4,000 nuns who care for underpriveleged, disadvantaged, and disabled persons through orphanages, AIDS hospices, and charity centers all over the world. Another focus of Mother Teresa’s lifetime ministry was to provide people with the opportunity to die with dignity. Calcutta’s Home for the Dying, a free hospice for the poor, provides residents with medical attention and allows “people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted.” Mother Teresa herself passed away on September 5, 1997. Her way of loving those with no capacity to repay her for her kindness more than qualifies Mother Teresa as a little Jesus.</p>
<p>to understand if we are going to recalibrate the church around the person of
understanding of God,
My proposal is not that we know what the word “god” means, and manage
somehow to fit Jesus into that. Instead, I suggest, that we think historically
vocation, riding into Jerusalem in tears, denouncing the Temple, and dying on
recentered around that point.39
Among other things, this will mean that the confession “Yahweh is Lord”</p>
<p>will transform into the primary New Testament confession of “Jesus is Lord,”
standing of God. And what this means in turn is that our loyalty to God must

response of our very lives. Everything we are and all that we have is included
ing Church (led by Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer) in Nazi Germany when
so-called Nazi Christians. They confessed
Just as Jesus Christ is the pledge of the forgiveness of sins, just so—and with
the same earnestness—is he also God’s mighty claim on our whole life; in him
and thankful service to his creatures. We repudiate the false teaching that there
areas in which we do not need justification and sanctification through him.41
Here lies the interface between the disciple and God. It is through the</p>
<p>redeeming lordship of Jesus. And when we talk of lordship, we are talking
this claim. And here is where it begins to impact us in a practical way. PerOur view of God is as the one true God. Our response is an existential one, through the redemptive work of Jesus.</p>
<p>As in the Shema, we can see all the elements of monotheism are present. The link between the one God (monotheism) and lifestyle (ethics) are
fully maintained. The difference between the Old Testament and the New
Messiah, hence Christocentric monotheism.

<h2>A Quick Word on the Trinity</h2>
<p>By now, any theologically sensitive reader would have asked the question, “Does all this focus on Jesus destroy the trinitarian fabric out of which
comes a genuinely Christian understanding of God and the world?” The last
Being. We affirm this with all orthodox Christians everywhere. Even though
missionally clumsy, they are nonetheless correct in what they affirm. Rather,
derstanding, one much closer to the trinitarianism of the New Testament
sive implications for any church recalibrating itself along the lines suggested
message, and jettisoning the unnecessary in order to focus on the essential.</p>
<p>Missiologically speaking, it is also essential that we travel lighter than we have in Christendom past. We believe we need to be as theologically unencumbered as possible so that we may more approximate the way the early Christians understood their relation to God. This has significant implication for missional movements and the rapid transfer of ideas, as Alan has demonstrated in The Forgotten Ways.42</p>
<p>And as for a christological center and starting point, we would argue
that any understanding of the Trinity must of necessity start with Jesus because it is he who introduces us into the Trinity in the first place. Any apChrist-likeness of God, thus enabling us to move from the relatively known to
elation, we need to frame whatever understanding we glean from Jesus in the
scholarship, without the Israel story we cannot understand Jesus properly,
the New Testament, we must know the story that gives it meaning.43 And so</p>
<p>Any true understanding of the Trinity arises out of an understanding of the nature of biblical monotheism. Otherwise what we end up with is tritheism, which certainly is not what the Bible teaches.</p>
<p>In returning to the essentials in this way, we are hoping to recover the
powerful dynamic, the ethos, and the faith structure of existential monotheism. This kind of monotheism tended to recede as the dogmatic and metareplaced the existential demands of the faith (othopraxy) with the need for</p>
<h2>To Sum Up</h2>
<p>Any examination of our own lives and communities will no doubt reveal
that we are all somehow torn between the great escape, as described above,
and the trembling desire to be more like Jesus, to know God more fully, and to
between the desire to hide from God in the garden and to reveal ourselves to
that it is the nature of his love that he desires to have us fully to himself. The
yet one who is able, through his sacrificial suffering on our behalf, to raise
avoid the radical place Jesus has in this schema of redemption. In Jesus, we

whom we exist. (1 Cor 8:6)</p>

<li>To the philosopher, monotheism can be defined as “the doctrine of, or</li>
</ol>
<p>belief in, the existence of but one God.” And following such a definition, one is either a monotheist or not. And whether one is or not can be determined by objective standards. People may hold to a doctrine of the existence of one God without ever involving the character of his or her personal relationship to that God. But this is not a biblical (existential) understanding of monotheism. In a strange sense, a biblical monotheism cannot even be defined, and no biblical writer attempts such a definition. At the most there is a witness to an encounter, a description of God’s visit, to which a specific person (or community) responds in faith that for him (or her, or them) there is only one Lord. The effect on the person or community will be the confession that God alone is our Creator and Redeemer, that God and God alone has the right to determine our duty and demand our loyalty, that our destiny lies in God’s hands alone. Others may have gods, but in reality they are idols.</p>
