<h1>Encountering Jesus Afresh</h1>
<p>Much of what gets in the way of a true and life-altering encounter with
Jesus can be traced to the problem of worldview. We have already seen how

too far off course to readjust their coordinates and get them back on track.</p>
<p>The occasional burst of their massive engines completes the readjustment and keeps them heading toward their destination. We think this is a useful metaphor for the church today. Many people are claiming that the church has been drifting off course and needs a burst of renewed power to get back on track. However, for spacecraft, that surge of propulsion works only if the coordinates are accurate and the flight plan is properly conceived. Today, many voices are calling the church back on track, acting like power surges for a drifting church. But our contention is that the church needs to go back to the drawing board and work again on its flight plan. If the plan is wrong, all the bursts of renewed energy will only push us further into space.</p>
<p>One of those areas that need to be re-examined is that of worldview.</p>
<p>Without an appreciation of the Hebraic worldview from which the New Testament was written, we can keep surging the church’s engines and keep getting more and more lost, even though it looks like we’re doing the right thing. By thinking in Hellenistic terms, we construct a highly philosophical approach to our world and indeed the Scriptures. Jacques Ellul notes that our fundamental problems in perception can be traced back to a change in the basic understanding of revelation, namely, the transition from history to philosophy:</p>

In other words, as Ellul goes on to explain, the shift away from the existential and historical revelation of God toward philosophical formulations
logians Ellul refers to expressed a profound and authentic faith marked by a
concern for truth, “all this was undermined and even falsified by the initial
transition of the idea of revelation” in the first place. The die was cast. Very

When we look at Jesus, we find that his approach to communicating kingdom truth squares with this very biblical idea of subjectivity in relation to truth.</p>
<p>Jesus’ method of communication is unbalancing. It destabilizes the smug complacency that stands between the individual and truth. Kierkegaard says,</p>

commentaries to glean more insight on a text. But trips to the commentary

<p>Our commitments to exegesis are now so one-dimensional that we no

manner. We suggest that alongside the task of exegesis (which we must do), we

Scriptures, and much to relearn as we seek to re Jesus our lives and churches.</p>
<p>This is not as far-fetched as it might seem at first. Any literature major at college is introduced to the art of reading himself or herself into the fictional text. The reader is invited to take the part of certain agents or players in a novel to try and assess the emotional and human richness of the material. When applied to our engagement with the Scriptures, this approach adds human warmth, pathos, perspective, and a generally richer reading of the text. And as we have already seen, this is part of what I gnatius Loyola demanded of his Jesuits.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which people have tried to overcome the distance
between written text and dynamic Word as addressed to us is the use of the
ancient practice of lectio divina, Latin for “divine reading.” The Bible is the Word
tional way of combining prayer and reading the Scriptures so that the Word of
ship with the Lord. It is a natural way of prayer and was developed and pracIt involves a way of reading the Scriptures whereby we gradually let go of our own agenda and open ourselves to what God wants to say to us. It is a way of praying with Scripture that calls one to study, ponder, listen, and, finally, pray from God’s Word. Any passage of Scripture can be encountered using lectio divina, as long as the passage is not too long. Lectio divina is not the same thing as exegesis but is a personal reading of the Scripture and application to one’s life. After quieting our hearts and laying our cares aside, worshipers engage the text. Lectio divina involves the following four “moments” or readings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lectio: the worshipper is invited to read the passage out loud, perhaps several times. It is best to read the Word of God slowly and</p>

<p>our own thoughts, both mundane and holy. We open our mind, heart,
 Three... Two... One... Engage 3 149</p>
<p>and soul to the influence of God. We rest in the Word of God and wait
within us with in a still small voice.
Any conversation must allow for both sides to communicate, and this</p>
<p>most unfamiliar act is allowing oneself to be open to hearing God speak. One
true conversation, is the assumption that we read it. We are the active party.</p>
<p>The Jewish approach to Scripture is that we don’t read the Bible but rather that it reads us! Our standard practice is to assume we are its interpreter and therefore the arbiter of its meaning. Jewish approaches reverse this: we are not the interpreter, but rather it is the Torah that interprets us. This is because it is God who addresses us in Scripture; hence the idea of revelation that is so important to a biblical worldview. “It is not so much that we raise questions about him, but that that he raises questions of us.”11</p>
<p>God addresses us and challenges us personally in and through Scripture.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Word Become Flesh, Jesus as the incarnated logos, we see this whole questioning played out in dynamic ways. The kingdom presses itself upon the world in Jesus. The rule of God challenges the false claims to loyalty that so easily ensnare us. Jesus in his teachings and actions is constantly driving us back to our assumptions, forcing us to play our cards, bringing us to account, demanding that we respond to the redeeming love of God expressed through him. What is clear is that when we engage Jesus, we never get to objectively interpret him—he does not allow us that epistemological luxury. In Jesus, love is on the offensive, wooing us into the transforming encounter with God. Just try bringing Jesus and the Bible into conversation with any latent middle-class consumerism you might have. In any genuine encounter with Jesus, we can either respond in faith and obedience, cut and run, or take the fire out of the issue by reinterpreting the Bible to suit our understandings. Ever heard yourself saying, “Oh it’s not what it means literally, Jesus is actually saying...” Just see what most preaching does with the kingdom way expressed in the Beatitudes, the Sermon on the Mount, or the rich young ruler—we emasculate the text by spiritualizing it or domesticating its direct implications.</p>
<h2>Hebraic Ways of Knowing</h2>
<p>We need to broaden our capacities to know God and to engage him
through the text of Scripture. Because of issues relating to worldview, as
previously discussed, we feel that we have to address this issue if we are to</p>
<p>The Hebraic approach to the knowledge of God includes the ways of the
heart, of obedience, of wonder, of action, as well as the intellectual life of a
person. We will look mainly at two, namely, the way of the heart and the way
that is funded by a sense of the immediacy of God. Jesus wants our hearts
and when we act in his name.
Orthopathy, or the Way of the Heart</p>
<p>As we have seen, engagement with Jesus must move us beyond being
spectators to participants. If we wish to become like him, we must learn to
actively participate in Jesus, actively applying him and his teachings to our
in the encounters described in the New Testament, the desire of people to
Pilate). It is those who allow Jesus to get at them who end up entering the
against their understandings of the faith, and because of this they are judged
doing in Jesus.
And the heart is the issue. When the Bible uses the word “heart,” it includes not only the source of emotion but of will, loyalty, and commitment.</p>
<p>In many ways the heart determines our actions, not just our feelings, and it’s critical to engage the heart when dealing with God (e. g., Ps 101:4; Isa 29:13; Matt 15:8). On this matter, the great revivalist Jonathan Edwards said:</p>
<p>The Holy Scriptures every where place religion very much in the affection; such
as fear, hope, love, hatred, desire, joy, sorrow, gratitude, compassion, and zeal.... It is an evidence that true religion lies very much in the affections, that the
hard heart is plainly meant an unaffected heart, or a heart not easy to be moved</p>
<p>Without the heart, we cannot comprehend God. Besides, none of the
really great things in human life spring only from the intellect but rather from
the heart, which can embrace what the mind cannot. The great anonymous
mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing says it this way: “Only to our mind is God

In biblical Hebrew, in order to know something, one doesn’t observe it,</p>
<p>but one must come into contact with it. This basic difference is developed in
ity changes everything. At the center is not a perceiving of one another but a
and incomparable height in the relation of God to those he has chosen.14
Closely allied to this way of knowing is the role played by passion or</p>
<p>affection in spirituality. Passion requires participation, involvement, faith.</p>
<p>Søren Kierkegaard can say, “If passion is eliminated, faith no longer exists.”15 The truth of God can be found only by such a passionate search and by applying one’s whole personality existentially. The criterion of the genuine search for truth is what Kierkegaard called inwardness, which requires an intense personal concern with it to be able to understand and assimilate it. Perhaps more widely known for this kind of approach was the American revivalist preacher Jonathan Edwards, made popular by his spiritual classic The Religious Affections. Edwards maintained that if the heart is left unmoved by God, no abiding action can, or will, take place. At its core, spirituality, what he called true religion, must redeem and direct our spiritual passion. It must involve the heart. And then he goes on to affirm that all great actions spring from the heart:</p>
<p>I am bold in saying this, but I believe that no one is ever changed, either by
less the affections are moved by these things.... In a word, there is never any
those things.... True religion is placed in the affections.16
These are bases of motivation as well as the means to know God. Essentially what we are trying to say here is that we have to engage our heart to
the long haul. The emotional connection with God provides us with distincIn fact, prayer and worship grant to the worshipper a real, if highly subjective, knowledge of God. Prosper of Aquitaine (ca. 390–436) stated it this

<p>According to Bonhoeffer, any other approach to the Scripture serves
only to provide the believer with an escape from the clear call to obedience.</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer can therefore speak of discipleship as a “problem of exegesis” and goes on to say, “By eliminating simple obedience on principle, we drift into an unevangelical interpretation of the Bible.”24 So, orthodoxy is not enough. As followers of Jesus, we have to start obeying long before we know and understand much of him whom we obey. More than that, if we take obedience out of the equation, we cannot even hope to truly understand the Bible. Calvin can claim that only when the Scriptures are believed and obeyed do sinful people even begin to have an epistemological foundation for true knowledge: “all right knowledge of God is born in obedience.”25</p>

<h2>Not Forgetting Orthodoxy</h2>
<p>Ancient theologians came up with the potent slogan lex seqendi, lex credendi, which means that the law of following is the law of belief. This means
that not only worship but also Christian life, ethics, and mission are centered</p>
<p>This concept also suggests that Christian doctrines about Jesus arose in part out of the experience of following him. “Christians found themselves in a relationship of following and obedience to Jesus Christ and found life within this relationship. That believing flows out of following underscores the necessity that theology, like Christian life itself, must be Christ-centered.”27 We must remember this lest we slip into an ideology about Jesus rather than a true following of Jesus. I deology is never enough.</p>
<p>We have noted that by itself orthodoxy, or mere creedal belief, is insufficient for a true knowledge of God. However, we are not suggesting that
orthodoxy is unimportant. Far from it. We believe that right belief is an esthat the church needs to reinterpret what it means by right belief and conositional truth, assuming that the knowledge of God is received through

As can be seen, it is in the nexus between orthopraxy, orthopathy, and</p>

<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, this is what the Shema (Deut 6:4–9)
aims at and what Jesus directly affirms as being at the heart of discipleship
and knowledge of God (Mark 12:28–34). We are to love God with all our heart,</p>
<p>To illustrate this we can look to Luke 7, where Jesus encounters some
Jewish elders sent by a Roman centurion to request that he heal the soldier’s
servant. When you read the Gospels and look to see who Jesus was personcalled him the greatest of all prophets. And this centurion was another. It’s

his dying slave, they are met by another emissary. The Roman has had second

<p>With Bultmannian form criticism holding such sway, it has been interesting to watch the emergence of the British scholar N. T. Wright. He has
been the leading light in the third quest for the historical Jesus (Bultmann
Tradition).30 If Bultmann and the many varieties of his followers pull each tiny
