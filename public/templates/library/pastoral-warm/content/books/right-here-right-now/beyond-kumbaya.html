<h1>Beyond Kumbaya</h1>
<h2>House Churches and Small Groups as Communities of Mission</h2>
<p>When the Holy Spirit transforms the life and practice of Christian communities, they demonstrate that God's promised future has been set in motion. The joy, freedom, and wholeness of life within the reign of God can already be tasted even if not yet fully consummated. While not perfection, life within the Christian community reflects, embodies, and witnesses to a "divine infection."</p>
<p>—Darrell Guder, Missional Church</p>
<p>It was a crisp October evening and I was rounding third base and heading for home. Aclose play at the plate was coming, and as I got closer and closer I had to decide when, and at what angle, to slide. The catcher outweighed me by a good eighty pounds, so bowling him over à la Pete Rose was not an option. Within just a few feet of the plate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could tell by the catcher’s body language and eyes that
was going to beat the ball, so I decided against sliding. But
he was still blocking the plate with his large frame. Running
and swung my left foot around him to touch the plate. Mil-
skidded across the surface of home plate and dug into the
most excruciating pain I had ever experienced in my life.</p>

<p>It was as if a great white shark had latched on to my leg.</p>
<p>Afriendly but intense softball league game had become a nightmare.</p>
<p>As a young pastor with no health insurance, though the knee was swollen to the size of a cantaloupe, I tried to convince myself it was just a sprain. Sure, I was on crutches for the next week, but I was back to riding my bike twenty miles a day, and a week after that I even played a little touch football. “I’ll be all right... I’m good,” I kept assuring my wife. Three weeks after the play at the plate, and after half a dozen incidents where my knee suddenly buckled, dropping me to the floor, I was in the office of an orthopedic surgeon. After examining my knee, Dr. Yamamoto pointed to my leg and said, “I don’t know how you’re able to walk.” With the last drops of machismo and optimism going down the drain, I asked, “I’m guessing that’s not good news?” Shaking his head, he said, “You have a torn anterior cruciate ligament... [long pause] and a torn posterior cruciate ligament... [another long pause] and your cartilage is torn as well.” I thanked him and told him that I would have to postpone surgery, but my wife and I had wanted to know for sure what was wrong. Dr. Yamamoto shared that he was a Christian and knew that many pastors were on tight incomes. He insisted on performing the surgery for free. That was a huge blessing. Eight months of therapy later and, other than two long scars and a big bump on the side of my knee, I was close to normal. From that point onward I would never look at
POSTSCRIPT the following verse the same: by Alan Hirsch “From him [Jesus] the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, The “body of Christ” expression grows and builds itself up in is much more than a memorable love, as each part does its work” metaphor.

What we are witnessing is the manifestation of the verse above. The body of Christ, not just paid professional clergy, is standing up and moving with missional intention and having an effect. The ligaments are strengthening and the body is getting out of the chair (pew) and moving—a critical step for making right here, right now impact. While statistics show that fewer and fewer people are going to church, there is a transition happening where more and more of the church is going to the world, living out the good news of the gospel. In the West, we’ve just begun the turnaround.</p>
<h2>Body Building</h2>
<p>In the early morning hours following surgery on my knee, I was awakened by a nurse who was bending my knee back and forth. Startled and in pain, I yelled, “What are you doing?” I was afraid she might be one of those middle of the night killer nurses and she was going to torture me before snuffing me out with a pillow. Without stopping, she grunted, “You need to start rehab.” I declared, “No... I need morphine!” She went on to explain that the muscles in my knee would quickly atrophy and that I had to immediately begin stretching my leg to keep that from happening and to start the long road back of regaining the range of motion in the knee.</p>
<p>Look again at the verse above. Notice that the apostle says the body of Christ “builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.” Love causes the body to grow in both strength and number. People outside of the body of Christ have the opportunity to see our love witness to the power of the gospel in two ways: how we love one another and how we love those who are not following Christ. They are both critical to missional faithfulness.</p>
<p>It might help to consider the following scenario: imagine if you were able to step out of your body for a period of time and observe your own faith community—say, your church, small group, or house church—from the eyes of a non-Christian. What might you see that would compel you to want to become part of it? Is there anything particularly unusual or remarkable that would cause you to say, “I’ve never seen people care for each other like that”? Scholar Norman Kraus speaks to the missional attractiveness of the faithful community of believers:</p>
<p>In the New Testament, repentance means renouncing our old self-centered life and adopting the new lifestyle of agape (love) demonstrated by Jesus. This same community, which exists “by grace through faith,” is also the community of witness.... It has the character of a movement always remaining in and for the world. Jesus described it as a “city set on a hill,” whose light beckons and guides the weary, lost traveler to the security and camaraderie of a civilized society.</p>
<p>In the city there was safety from the marauders who took advantage of the darkness to rob and kill. In a friendly city foreigners could find protection and hospitality. Thus Jesus used the city as a symbol of the saving community, whose light shines in the gathering darkness, inviting the traveler to find salvation.1</p>
<h2>Relearning Koinonia</h2>
<p>People who were involved in the evangelical church in the 1970s or early 1980s will remember the word koinonia. It is a Greek word from which the English New Testament word for “fellowship” is translated. It was used a lot because, if for no other reason, it just sounds deep. See if you agree. If someone tells you, “We gathered in koinonia,” doesn’t that sound a lot more spiritual than if they say, “We got together for tacos”?</p>
<p>Even if you’ve never heard of koinonia, as a Christian no doubt you are familiar with fellowship. For the most part, fellowship has become little more than a label that Christians use when speaking about getting together. Just about any gathering becomes fellowship for us. If a group is planning to watch the Super Bowl together, the church bulletin will add the tagline, “fun, food, and fellowship.” If a group of ladies are planning a baby shower, others are invited to “fellowship with us at Jenny’s shower.” Fellowship is a good word. It’s biblical and central to the lifeblood of the church. But it’s a word we need to relearn, to redefine back to its original meaning. One of the most often quoted verses on fellowship is Acts 2:42, which says: “They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer” (NASB).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can learn a lot about the biblical definition of fellowship
by looking at the verses that follow Acts 2:42. It’s not hard to
see that the early Christians defined fellowship as something
having a Christmas party. “And all those who had believed
selling their property and possessions and were sharing them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two chapters later, in Acts 4, we see pretty much the same thing said again: And the congregation of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them claimed that anything belonging to him was his own, but all things were common property to them. And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all. For there was not a needy person among them, for all who were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles’ feet, and they would be distributed to each as any had need. (vv. 32–35 NASB)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of sermons based on Acts 2:42, but not
many on verses 44–45 or Acts 4:32–35. What is it about these
passages that draws such neglect? One reason could be that
the case at all. Both passages paint a picture of the selfless
King James Version of Acts 2:45 says the believers “sold”
a once and for all action. But the Greek tense of the word
The message is that this community had a living ethos that
every available means as the occasion arose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see the essence of genuine biblical fellowship.</p>
<p>It is a deeply committed unity of comradeship. In fact, the word koinonia is used in Luke 5:10 to describe the relationPOSTSCRIPT ship between Peter, James, and by Alan Hirsch John. The King James Version and most other modern translations as well say these three men We must recalibrate back to were “partners” in the fishing authentic koinonia. It is critical business. The word used for that we cease from our overly “partners” is the Greek word consumeristic propensity to pick koinonia, the same word for and choose the Scriptures we fellowship. enjoy and are comfortable with.</p>
<p>This sheds a lot of light on
Perhaps it is the ones we are most what the Bible is conveying uncomfortable with that provide us by fellowship. We’re talking a clue to the renewal of Christian about something way beyond community. True fellowship calls warm fuzzies among a group of us to that kind of sacrificial sharing people who meet every week or and a quality of our relationship so around Bible study and Chex that that can truly be described by Mix. Justo González points out observers as loving community. the depth of biblical koinonia in the following word study: In Philippians 3:10, what the Revised Standard Version translates as “share his sufferings” actually says “know the koinonia of his sufferings.” In 1 Corinthians 10:16, Paul says, “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?” The term that the Revised Standard Version translates here as “participation,” with a footnote explaining that it could also be translated as “communion,” is koinonia. Paul’s letter to the Philippians, which acknowledges receipt of a gift, begins with words in which Paul is thanking the Philippians for their partnership and sharing with him. In 1:5, he says that he is thankful for the Philippians’ koinonia, and two verses later he declares that they are “joint koinonoi” of grace with him, that is, common owners or sharers. At the end of the epistle, he says that they have shared in his trouble (4:14), and the term he uses could be translated as “cokoinonized.” All of this leads to the unique partnership “in giving and receiving” that he has enjoyed with the church of the Philippians (4:15), and once again the word he uses literally means “koinonized.” In short, koinonia is much more than a feeling of fellowship; it involves sharing goods as well as feelings.2 True fellowship largely eludes most Christians. This has caused the church to lose something of its very essence, flavor, and power to transform and deliver the good news of the gospel. It’s like a hollow chocolate bunny, promising more than it delivers. If we were honest, we would admit that, to an unnerving degree, we are not really much different from the bingo club down the road.</p>
<p>I once heard of a football coach whose team was a huge underdog in a big game. His last words to his team before they ran onto the field were, “When you fight an 800-pound gorilla, the way to do it is to walk straight up to him and hit him right in the mouth.” We’ve talked about one of the huge gorillas we Americans are going up against—the consumeristic spirit of “me first, mine first.” Living in genuine fellowship, real koinonia, is a step toward hitting this beast square in the teeth.</p>
<h2>Unfeigned Love</h2>
<p>The early Christian communities understood that the new birth meant they were not born as orphans. They were part of a new family. Jesus said as much on one occasion when things were getting a bit dicey for him. His mother and brothers came to take him home, and someone told him they were standing outside, waiting for him. Jesus asked, “Who is my mother and my brothers?” He then pointed to his disciples and said, “Behold my mother and brothers” (see Matt. 12:47–49).</p>
<p>The early Christians understood they had passed from death to life, from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of God’s dear Son, and they were not bringing their old life into his. That life was dead.</p>
<p>They were not bringing their old POSTSCRIPT sense of cultural “entitlement” by Alan Hirsch into this new life. Those rights had passed away. This was a new society, a new culture, and Genuine biblical faith in God takes a new community. To be in this us to a place that is beyond intelnew family meant you were no lectual ascent and a mere collation of correct ideas about God. longer an individual but a memIt transforms us into carriers and ber. Not a club member, but a transmitters of the very love that body part, a part of the body rescued us in the first place. There of Christ. And if another body is a clear and distinct connection part felt pain, you felt pain as between God and the lifestyles that well, and you could no more igshould be produced from a living nore another member in trouble encounter with God. Middle-class than your eyes could ignore... culture is all too often contrary to say, a torn up knee.

Both hands clutched my leg middle-class preoccupation with and every nerve seemed to be safety and security. screaming “Help!” for the injured member of the body.</p>
<p>Love is such an easy word to toss around. So easy, in fact, that we have cheapened it. I once saw two bumper stickers on a truck. The one on the left said, “I love Cindy.” The sticker on the right said, “I love my truck.” I thought, “Wow. I bet Cindy is really touched by the fact that her cowboy ranks her right up there with his truck.” The precise phrase “Love one another” is used a dozen times and its essence is conveyed in numerous other ways throughout the New Testament. On two occasions the apostles Paul and Peter spoke of love that is unfeigned.3 This is an old word that means sincere, or not faked. Love is a word that demands sincerity, or the opposite of hypocrisy. It means the real deal. Peter says we are to be “obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren.”4 Atangible love for the members of our Jesus-family is the only proper response to the truth of Jesus and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Eugene Peterson underscores this essence in his translation of James 2:14–17: Dear friends, do you think you’ll get anywhere in this if you learn all the right words but never do anything? Does merely talking about faith indicate that a person really has it? For instance, you come upon an old friend dressed in rags and half-starved and say, “Good morning, friend! Be clothed in Christ! Be filled with the Holy Spirit!” and walk off without providing so much as a coat or a cup of soup—where does that get you? Isn’t it obvious that God-talk without God-acts is outrageous nonsense? (Message) Who Is “Whoever”?</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in the United States for long has seen “John 3:16” on a billboard, spray painted on an overpass, or on a poster board at a ballgame: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life” (NKJV). It’s a verse we are very familiar with, to say the least. Let’s look at another verse—written by the same guy—that most Christians would just as soon forget: But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? (1 John 3:17 NASB) So, who is this whoever person? The “whoever” in this verse is the same “whoever” that is in John 3:16. And John (the apostle who penned both verses) says the same love that was believed on by “whoever” in John 3:16 must also be passed on by “whoever” to the other “whoevers.” Otherwise, John asks, “How can the love of God even be in whoever in the first place?” He is saying that the same blood that gave us a new heart should be flowing through our hearts toward others.</p>
<p>Is this a penetrating verse or what? It delivers a clear message, bringing that “Who is my family?” thing back up. It reorients us to the truth that we are members of a new family, and we should have the same natural inclinations toward helping our spiritual family members that we have to our natural family members. Amissional community does more than pray and study the Bible. It takes its cues from the Bible and incarnates the Word of God in the lives of its members.</p>
<p>Just imagine what could happen in your own church or small group if this understanding of spiritual family were adopted.</p>
<p>Even further, imagine all across the United States, during the recent recession and housing crisis, if the church of Jesus Christ would have, en masse, lived out the pattern of community seen in the early church. For one thing, a lot of downsizing and ridding of consumeristic extras would have happened, not merely in the name of renunciation of materialism, but in favor of Christian community and for the glory of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Pointing to the following passage from Jesus’ final prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Francis Schaeffer calls true Christian community the “final apologetic.” Father, I pray that all of them will be one, just as you are in me and I am in you. I want them also to be in us. Then the world will believe that you have sent me. (John 17:21 NIrV)</p>
<p>Schaeffer says, “We cannot expect the world to believe that the Father sent the Son, that Jesus’ claims are true, and that Christianity is true, unless the world sees some reality of the oneness of true Christians.”5</p>
<h2>Missional Salsa</h2>
<p>Missional communities are those that intentionally practice the faith. These groups agree on particular ways of engaging the world around them and how to “gospel” the community within which they live. But these are not linear steps. They are not hard-and-fast rules. These moves are more like a dance, a rhythm that provides a bit of order and direction for living, while allowing for improvisation. To make them into stringent rules would be to degenerate into dead religious rules of duty.</p>
<p>The most succesful missional communities are ones that commit to a set of missional habits. This is a way for each member to live out the apostolic commandment to “provoke one another to love and good deeds” (Heb. 10:24 NRSV).</p>
<p>Michael Frost and his faith community have adopted five practices that form the acrostic, BELLS.6 Let’s look at them:</p>
<h2>Bless</h2>
<p>They seek to to do three acts of blessing a day: one to a member of the Christian community, one to a nonChristian, and one spare. Blessings can range from a simple email of encouragement to a gift of some sort or whatever.</p>
<h2>Eat</h2>
<p>They share at least three meals each week with others. Same deal as above: one with a member of the Christian community, one with a non-Christian, and one spare. The idea is that around the table, gospel things happen.</p>
<h2>Listen</h2>
<p>They commit to at least one hour per week of listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Some members have a prayer walk routine or a particular weekly time of solitude of listening to God.</p>
<h2>Learn</h2>
<p>They commit to read from the Gospels each week in order to specifcally learn more about Jesus. The Gospels are always included in the weekly rhythm in order to POSTSCRIPT constantly stay Jesus-cenby Alan Hirsch tered. They also commit to read from other books of the Bible.

One of the most powerful mission on their day-toillustrations of poverty is seen in a day journey.

We were with Jesus during the way, and how they have resisted made in the image of the Creator to Jesus during the day. This be creative. Awaken the kingdom is a consistent reminder dream-capacities of the imagination. that they are God’s sent Asanctified imagination is a people.

<p>Henri Nouwen said, “My whole life I have been complaining that my work was constantly interrupted, until I discovered that my interruptions were my work.”7 If we can just keep ourselves awake to the fact that we are God’s good news people, life takes on renewed siginificance, every day. Much of what we call mundane and routine can spark to life if we will allow our imaginations to come alive in a missional orientation.</p>
<p>My own community developed an altered version of the BELLS practices. An element of our weekly gatherings includes going through the acrostic and sharing our experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We usually do it around a common meal. It has become a
highlight of our gatherings. Many times someone will share
how something the Lord spoke to them during their listening
had members share that something they saw in the Gospels
sprang up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Missional Line Dance</h2>
<p>Small groups and house churches have the opportunity to synergize their collective resources and energy into significant impact in their communities. Our groups should be dancing two styles of missional dance: the salsa speaks more to our individual missional rhythm; the line dance is about our efforts as a community working in concert. Missional communities prayerfully look for needs and opportunities to be the gospel in their towns and cities. This makes way for the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>The Renew Community, a church near Philadelphia, is actually a collection of smaller house churches. These decentralized Jesus communities participate in three rhythms each month—exploring, serving, and celebrating. Alan and I asked J. R. Briggs, the founder, to share about how his church dances together in mission:</p>
<p>Our house churches explore the Scriptures together by looking at God’s Story and how we fit into that Grand Story in order to join with his mission. They work to partner with an organization, school, or group to serve beyond themselves among those in need. And they celebrate together with parties, because Jesus said the kingdom of God is like a party.</p>
<p>One house church partnered with a group home for those with mental disabilities. Last Christmas they threw a party for the residents and staff. Afew women cooked a hearty dinner and one of our guys brought his guitar and sang Christmas songs.</p>
<p>Some of our folks spent time listening, encouraging, and praying with the worn-out and discouraged employees.</p>
<p>Everyone chipped in and bought the residents a Nintendo Wii game system, and some kids from the house church taught the residents how to play the games. Anews reporter heard about the party and wanted to write a story on it. When asked what kind of church they were, they said, “We’re a church that throws Christmas parties for those with mental disabilities, because it’s what we think Jesus would be doing if he were here today.” Another house church studied Scripture to explore poverty and the role of the church. As they studied, they partnered with the soup kitchen/food pantry down the street. The director was invited one week to discuss the specific needs of those within the region and the practical ways the house church could help meet those needs. The following week, families with children in the house church helped put together food packets for the soup kitchen.</p>
<p>Still another house church has a regular attendee named Herb who has developmental disabilities. They provide rides for Herb when their house church meets and check in on him regularly. On a warm summer evening last year, they gathered friends in the park and threw Herb a thirty-ninth birthday party. Caring for Herb opened up opportunities for dialogue and helped us build trust with the county social service agency that provides Herb with help and guidance. This agency is now one of our church’s official partnerships where we give of our time, energy, and finances regularly.</p>
<p>Mission is at the heart of the gospel, and being on mission together, especially as middle-class suburban dwellers, is another step toward keeping the consumeristic bent at bay.</p>
<p>Shared adventures are like glue to relationships, and there really is adventure to be had, if we will open our eyes and ears to see the needs right under our noses.</p>
<p>My friend Tri Robinson tells the story of visiting with his father shortly after he returned from a fiftieth-year reunion with his World War II bomber squadron. He told Tri that though it had been half a cenPOSTSCRIPT tury since he had seen most of his crew, it was as if no time had by Alan Hirsch passed at all, relationship wise.</p>

<h2>Living Stones</h2>
<p>Welcome to the living Stone, the source of life. The workmen took one look and threw it out; God set it in the place of honor. Present yourselves as building stones for the construction of a sanctuary vibrant with life, in which you’ll serve as holy priests offering Christ-approved lives up to God.</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:4–5 Message The church is God’s master plan. When we encounter it, we are coming across something uncommon. We are moving into spiritual territory. It is God taking residence in the midst of our very humanity. The Scripture above says that God himself takes our "common" lives, joins us together, and turns us into something he lives in.</p>
<p>Afew years ago my wife and I built our own house. Usually when I tell someone that, they say, “You mean you were your own contractor, right?” The answer is, no, we built it ourselves. We hired out about 10 percent of the work and did the rest ourselves. The outside of the house included quite a bit of stonework. This was a tedious process of picking up individual stones, one by one, and trying to fit them together.</p>
<p>Each stone was a different shape and size. I would pick up a rock, turn it this way and that, hold it up on the wall to see if it looked right, and then I either slapped mortar on its back and placed it on the house or tossed it aside.</p>
<p>At the end of the project I was left with a pile of stones I had “rejected,” as in the verse above. The apostle Peter says that Jesus was the rejected stone. God takes our lives, joins us around Jesus, and constructs a habitat for his own presence and glory. This verse wasn’t written to individuals, it was written for the community of believers. We can’t take this verse and give it a personal, privatized interpretation.</p>
<p>Peter is saying that God joins our lives together and we become a community of priests. And thank God, we don’t have to wear those tight collars either. The Latin word for “priest” is pontifex. It means “bridge builder.” A priest is someone who builds bridges for others to come to God. We are a community of bridge-building priests. Wow! Imagine that. Yes, imagine that!</p>
