<h3>About the Shapevine Missional Series</h3>
<p>The key purpose of Shapevine the organization is to bring the various elements of missional Christianity—namely, church planting movements, urban mission, the emerging church, the missional church movement, the organic/simple church, and marketplace ministries—into meaningful dialogue around the truly big ideas of our time. Consistent with this purpose, the Shapevine Missional Series in partnership with Baker Books seeks to bring innovative thinking to the missional issues of church planting, mission, evangelism, social justice, and anything in between.</p>
<p>We seek to publish both established authors as well as others who have significant things to contribute but have operated largely under the radar.</p>
<p>The series will focus on three distinctive areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Living—Practical Missional Orthopraxy</strong></p>
<p>Orthopraxy is what makes orthodoxy worth having. We yearn for the experience and continual flow of living out the gospel message in our day-to-day lives for the sake of others. The stories and ideas in the Shapevine Missional Series are aimed at providing practical handles and means to wrap our readers' minds around the idea of living as the people of God, sent into the world with the Spirit and impulse of Jesus himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning—Solid Missional Orthodoxy</strong></p>
<p>Jesus both lived and proclaimed a theology of a missional God. His was and is a message of mercy, justice, and goodness toward others. It was this message that erupted into the greatest movement in the history of humankind. The same God who sent his only Son now sends those who follow his Son, in the same manner and with the same message. This is at the heart of a missional theology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leading—Tools for Missional Leadership</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our aim is for the books in this series to serve as tools for pastors, organizational leaders, and church members throughout the world to equip themselves and others as they travel the path of faithfulness in the missional life.</p>
<p>As a global interactive forum, Shapevine allows anyone to both learn and contribute at whatever level suits. To learn more, go to www.shapevine.com or contact us at info@shapevine.com.</p>
