<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Just over a decade ago the seminal, but very technical, work of the Gospel and Our Culture Network (GOCN.org) arrived on the scene and began to give language for what our most thoughtful missional leaders had been searching for sometime prior to that. In the time since Missional Church has become a veritable belle of the ball: a Google search yields about two million hits. But words can be such voguish creatures, destined to fade away. Will it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not if we can help it.</p>
<p>We do not believe, as some have suggested, that missional is a fad. We believe it touches on the very nature of Christianity and is therefore foundational to the message of Jesus. But because of the largeness of the concept, the word missional does not easily submit to definitions; certainly it is not a technique or a church growth system or tool.</p>
<p>For followers of Jesus, missional shapes our discipleship, defines our ministry, describes our mission, and points to the very purpose of his church. It’s a term that comes from the inside of God and from deep within the nature of the church that Jesus built.</p>
<p>Our hope for this book is that it will serve as a tool and resource, whether you are a pastor or church planter or simply a follower of Jesus trying to get it right in love and obedience to our Lord. This book is written to equip all believers and to serve as a guide in the journey of living as salt and light in the name of Jesus Christ, regardless of situation, vocation, or location. It is to take the rather academic concept of missional and make it accessible to the whole body of Christ.</p>
<p>We believe it belongs to the whole church and must somehow be factored into the equation of discipleship, spirituality, and church at every level of our experience if we are going to be the people God has made us to be.</p>
<p>Through engaging with thousands of pastors, church planters, and church leaders across North America, Europe, and Australia, we are consistently confronted with questions about how to engage missionally—in urban, rural, or suburban contexts. Misunderstanding and stereotypes abound.</p>
<p>Many suburban folk misconstrue missional engagement as something that takes place primarily in poor city central or in exploited parts of the world. Others hold the view that it involves church outreach/evangelism in the neighborhood or churchwide evangelistic efforts abroad. Some see missional as simply planting new churches, yet others see it as involving social justice activism and living in radical communities among the poor and marginalized.</p>
<p>The truth is, all of these are aspects of missional engagement, but on their own, separated from the whole, they form only part of the equation. And it is the whole we must see to fully understand what we are dealing with. Missionality involves every believer who seeks to follow Jesus authentically right here, right now. It is linked to discipleship, and discipleship is a function of the church, which is connected to the lordship of Jesus. The lordship of Jesus involves every one of us as a representative of the King in every sphere and domain of society. That’s what we are trying to encourage: missional Christianity—a spunky, high-impact, life-oriented, world-transforming, joyous, living for Jesus our King. An outward-focused, kingdom-oriented discipleship that changes our world.</p>
<h2>Living the Adjective</h2>
<p>So we have set our aim here to help Christians see the kingdom opportunities that exist on the pathways of their daily routines and lifestyle patterns and to live missionally more than simply do mission activities. We want to take this adjective, missional, and make it a living reality in the lives of Christians everywhere. All Christians, whether suburban or urban, blue collar or white collar, have already been sent by God on a mission and they have tremendous kingdom potential in the here and now of their current situations. God is already there at work in our neighborhoods, workplaces, amusement parks, schools, movie theatres, pubs, or wherever, and we must learn again what it means to courageously join him in his mission of redeeming his world. Like we say in our subtitle, we want to awaken a spicy missional moxie, not just in so-called professional Christians and clergy, but in everyone.</p>
<p>The intention of this book is not simply to decry the failures of the Western church or to paint a Mayberryesque vision of some sort of utopia. Simply adding quarterly block parties or participating in urban plunges is not enough to be missional— although, as we shall see, they certainly can be part of it.</p>
<p>What we are proposing goes deeper and should hopefully result in a reformation of the way we actually live our lives as Jesus followers. To do this we have to recast vision, play with paradigms, dream out loud, shout, coax, whisper. However we might achieve it, we don’t want to leave you unchanged.</p>
<p>So we are going to play the part of missiological optometrists, fitting you with eyewear that helps you see a way of living faithfully to God’s mission in the world, right here, right now.</p>
<p>And we want to help you connect with the sheer joy of living with that little adjective firmly in its place—a missional (which is to say authentic, indeed biblical) form of Christianity.</p>
<h2>How We Have Written This Book</h2>
<p>You will soon find this is a little different from most coauthored books. The contents of the book are sandwiched between a briefing chapter ("Right Here") in the beginning and a debriefing chapter ("Right Now") at the end, both written by Alan. These are designed to provide a framework for new thinking and acting. The middle sections are written by Lance, but Alan inserts himself into the conversation all along the way, like a resident heckler or a built-in commentator of sorts, whose ideas cajole us to think more deeply about things being discussed. Our writing process has included countless hours discussing these chapters, and Lance has focused on bringing Alan's perspectives to the contents. The remarks in the Postscript columns therefore are designed to provide further prompts and boosts to the story that is woven around it. We think this is both a playful and helpful literary device, but it also allows us to speak with our own voices. Alan, for reasons known only to God, is the more technical and theologically geeky, and will therefore role-play the resident don throughout the book. Lance, on the other hand, will be the folksier, easygoing American interpreter and storyteller, playfully suggesting ways in which we can integrate these ideas into our everyday lives. Between the two of us, we hope you will hear something of the Word of God to our time.</p>
<h3>Some Other Splinters for Your Mind</h3>
<p>Three books will be important here, and they will be referred to throughout these pages. The first one, Untamed,^1 is on the nature of missional discipleship and is utterly foundational to the issue of what it means to be a missional Christian right here, right now. We recommend you consider reading this book as a backup to the one in your hand now. For foundational approaches to incarnational mission in the West, we recommend The Shaping of Things to Come as the backup text.^2 Although a harder read, many of the ideas in this book find their origin there. And thirdly, for applying missionality throughout the church and church organizations, we suggest reading The Forgotten Ways Handbook.^3 This is an intensely practical reworking of the more theoretical The Forgotten Ways^4 (if, however, you want to really dig in to the ideas, go there). You might also look into re Jesus: A Wild Messiah for a Missional Church,^5 a book written to take us all back to Jesus to rediscover what it's all about in the first place.</p>
<p>The other books that help us reframe the way we engage our worlds are Hugh Halter and Matt Smay’s The Tangible Kingdom: Creating Incarnational Community, which has the associated Tangible Kingdom Primer. These are toprate tools that help churches becoming incarnational (as the subtitle suggests) with a focus primarily on the communal side of the equation.6 Michael Frost’s Exiles7 and Neil Cole’s Search and Rescue and Organic Church are excellent, highly accessible works on missional discipleship and church. Some older, more evangelistically inclined books are Shamy and Petersen’s The I nsider and Randy Frazee’s The Connecting Church. And a serious classic is Roland Allen’s Missionary Methods: St. Paul’s or Ours?</p>
<p>Books by Reggie Mc Neal are also gems, especially Missional Renaissance. All of these are designed to reframe the way we see Christianity and reorient us to becoming a missional church again in our time.</p>
<p>For accessible, context-based training, we suggest the various offerings of Shapevine (shapevine.com), Forge (forgeamerica.org, forgecanada.ca, forge.org.au), and Missio (missio.us); Church 3.0 in Alabama (3mlt.com); and in the UK we suggest Together in Mission (togetherinmission.co.uk).</p>
<p>Anyhow, enough about books and training, let’s get to the real thing—living the message in a way that brings Jesus into the imagination and experience of people who would never normally get access to him through our current means. We have a great opportunity in our day through our decisions and deeds to maximize impact in ways we never dreamed of before. If ever there was a time to get our act together, it is now. So, here’s to faithfulness, authenticity, and loving Jesus in ways he deserves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we get out of the glass bottles of our ego,
and when we escape like squirrels turning in the
cages of our personality
we shall shiver with cold and fright
so that we don't know ourselves.</p>
<p>Cool, unlying life will rush in, and passion will make our bodies taut with power, we shall stamp our feet with new power and old things will fall down, we shall laugh, and institutions will curl up like burnt paper.</p>
