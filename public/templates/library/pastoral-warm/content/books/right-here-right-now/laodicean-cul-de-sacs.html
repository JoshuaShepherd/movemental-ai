<h1>Laodicean Cul-de-Sacs</h1>
<h2>Western Affluence and Spiritual Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>The house stirred my friends’ memory, and he told how the old-time people used to visit each other in the evenings. There used to be a sort of institution in our part of the country known as “sitting till bedtime.” After supper, when they weren’t too tired, neighbors would walk across the fields to visit each other. They popped corn, my friend said, and ate apples and talked.</p>
<p>Sometimes they told stories about each other, about themselves, living again in their own memories and thus keeping their memories alive. Among the hearers of these stories were always the children. When bedtime came, the visitors lit their lanterns and went home. My friend talked about this, and thought about it, and then he said, “They had everything but money.” Wendell Berry, What Are People For?</p>

<p>Robust industry created an opportunity to capitalize exponentially on profits, and the wool and salve industry spawned a third industry that created even more wealth. Laodicea became a major hub for currency exchange and lending. It not only had a corner on the market in textiles and a worldfamous medical industry, it was also a prosperous financial center. Historians of the time wrote much of the great wealth of Laodicea.</p>
<p>For such a hip city, Laodicea still had an embarrassing weakness. It lacked an adequate water source. Cold water had to be piped in from the abundant supply at Colossae, but this city was a good ten miles away, and by the time it arrived at Laodicea it was lukewarm. Hot water was supplied from Hierapolis, home to natural hot springs, but this city was six miles away. So by the time the water arrived it too was lukewarm. This was the backdrop for the following passage where Jesus speaks a stern warning to the church at Laodicea: To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, “I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.” But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. (Rev. 3:14–18) This is one of those smash-mouth passages. Jesus turns his cap around backward and gets right in the face of the church of Laodicea. He lays into their pride and security by drawing a metaphor from something familiar to everyone there. Cold water quenches thirst and is a great refresher.</p>
<p>Hot water has great medicinal value and is good for teas and soups. But what is lukewarm water good for? Nothing. It just hits the palate all wrong, and Jesus says that this is the true state of Laodicea. In spite of surface appearances, they are lukewarm, just like their water. The Laodiceans were no doubt self-conscious about their lack of hot water, so this message would have been like a direct hit in the solar plexus.</p>
<p>The Lord says their famous black wool fails to cover their own spiritual nakedness, the bankruptcy of their heart overshadows their material wealth, and the blindness of their spiritual eyes has left them in a directionless state. He admonishes them to seek clothing of white, a reference to purity of heart and righteousness. In essence Jesus says, “This eye salve you are making so much money on can’t cure your own spiritual blindness. And your strong economy? It’s really just a smoke screen for your spiritual bankruptcy.” Have you ever seen a football or rugby player who has really had his bell rung? He is on the bench, and the trainer places a vial of smelling salts under his nose. If the guy just sits there sniffing the ammonia, with no reaction, it’s clear he’s jacked up. Aclearheaded person reacts immediately to smelling salts. Unless the player is totally out of it, his head snaps back and his eyes pop wide open. This is what the trainer hopes to see—the player shocked into awareness. This passage should do the same to us as Jesus followers in the current body of Christ in the West. The alarm here is that Jesus’ accusations are not aimed at the secular city itself. We can’t say, “Yeah, the world is screwed up.” No, Jesus is not admonishing unbelievers in this passage. He is talking strictly to the church at Laodicea, not society at large.</p>
<p>The Laodicean church had become so comfortable and at one with the host culture that it left them with no noticeable difference in their way of life, concerns, and pursuits. The Christians there were manifesting the same proud, arrogant, and conceited attitude as the non-Christians. And they were pursuing the same agenda of prosperity, security, comfort, and convenience as the host culture.</p>
<p>Jesus’ response is, “I want to spit you out of my mouth.</p>
<p>You think everything is just fine and that you are on the right track... in need of nothing.” Jesus points out that nothing can be done with people like this. He says, “I wish you were either hot or cold.” Why would he say that?</p>
<p>Acold person is someone who is clearly far from God, is aware of it, and usually makes no bones about it. There is something I love about these people. Maybe it’s their raw honesty. Brian is a friend of mine who would fall into the “cold” category. I deeply love and thoroughly enjoy being around him. We talk politics, spirituality, parenting, and sports—basic life stuff. The thing I appreciate about Brian is that he is up front with the fact that he has no interest in following Christ. He reads everything that Richard Dawkins writes and calls himself an almost atheist. He is extremely intelligent and has a smile that is contagious. I always tell him that when the light of God comes alive in him, he is going to be a Zorro for the kingdom of God. I actually have hope for Brian because he is cold regarding God. Imagine that.</p>
<p>The hot person is someone who is on fire for God. They are POSTSCRIPT hungry for the things of the Lord by Alan Hirsch and are available to him without hesitation.

<h2>The American Dreamworld</h2>
<p>It’s hard not to see irony in the fact that the word Laodicea is a compound of two words: laos (“the peoples”) and dike (“rights”). How fitting—“the people’s rights”—as in the right to pursue happiness. Afew years ago, in a sermon series on living missionally, I made the suggestion to members of our church to look for bargain clothing at thrift stores as a means of stewarding their money in more missional ways. My wife had been doing this with our family for some time, and it had become a bit of a treasure hunt for us. This suggestion took on tremendous momentum, and a group of our folks even printed and made copies of a booklet that mapped out and gave descriptions of second-hand clothing stores in the St. Louis area. We even had quick fashion shows on Sunday mornings where people would wear their “new” outfits and share the price they paid. It became a common sight to see someone in our foyer twirl and tug on her clothes, saying, “Salvation Army Store, Brentwood. Two bucks!” The Laodicean spirit didn’t take this lying down. One person in our church took great offense that I would make such a suggestion and “shove it down people’s throats.” “He has no place telling me how to spend my money. I have the right to spend my money the way I want,” was the response. As the thrift store movement trudged on, it wasn’t long until this family felt “led” to move to another church. I felt like Jerry Maguire, defending his vision statement. “It was just a suggestion!” I said.</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that for most Christians in the West, the dominant forces that shape their lives run counter to the values of Jesus. Like weekend tourists, the Christian majority is obliviously floating downstream, soaking in the same concerns, wants, and agendas of the prevailing culture, drifting wherever the current takes them. Oh, we still have the common headline-grabbing moral values and issues that typically arise during political election seasons. “Values” bumper stickers are pasted all over the rafts and inner tubes of the Christian party as it floats in the same direction as those it points fingers at.</p>
<p>What has happened to our values when it comes to the vices of covetousness, the unbridled consumption of earthly goods, gluttony, and the amassing of more and more with no end in sight? Most of this happens with little or no regard for the needs or plight of those whose backs Western consumption is built upon, much less the destruction it’s doing to our own lives and God-given calling. This has contributed to a lukewarm Christianity that is the norm in the so-called evangelical world. Pope John Paul II said it well:</p>

ism, Nazism and Fascism, and also of myths like racial superi-

<p>The average American home is now more than double the size of a home from the 1950s. The irony here is that the average American family is smaller now than it was in the ’50s. Though families are smaller, the definition of “necessities” grows almost yearly. What we think we need to survive ranges from mobile phones to air-conditioning, to at least two cars. America is an I-want-my-own-I-want-it-now-I-want-itbig-and-I-want-it-the way-I-want-it culture. And the average American Christian is just as drunk on consumerism as the non-Christian at the other end of the bar. American Mania author Peter Whybrow says:</p>
<p>Avariety of surveys conducted during the 1980s and 1990s recorded a declining satisfaction with life in America. Why, for example, does nearly one-third of the U.S.. population now struggle with the complications of obesity? And why, amid our drive for wealth and self-improvement, are the best-selling drugs on the American market those prescribed for the stressrelated diseases of ulcer, depression, and high blood pressure?</p>
<p>In our demand-driven, debt-saturated culture many families find themselves too pressured to enjoy, even to notice, their affluence. Time is chronically in short supply and the “free moments” that once balanced a busy life have all but disappeared. The demands of securing and maintaining material wealth in a rapidly shifting economic climate—particularly for Americans who shoulder considerable debt—have created an accelerated, competitive lifestyle that steals away sleep and kindles anxiety, threatening the intimate social webs that sustain family and community.3</p>
<p>Fallen human nature defaults to self-preservation, lust, greed, and longing for power. Just place three Oreos in a room of four five-year-olds and watch nature take its course.</p>
<p>Somebody’s gonna be crying real soon. On the other hand, self-restraint, mercy, empathy for others, and giving are learned behavior. The church is God’s ideal social order and there is to be a significant, life-altering economic side of the kingdom of God that comes to bear on all who seek to follow Jesus as Lord. In Faith and Wealth, Justo González remarks, “Themes of economic justice appear repeatedly in the preaching of Jesus and of the early movement. They show up often in the background, as in the many parables that deal with economic matters, (such as) the laborers in the vineyard, the unjust steward, the talents, and so forth. And they POSTSCRIPT appear in the foreground, often by Alan Hirsch in starker terms and with more radical demands.”4 This mindset is all but lost in The heart of discipleship is Western Christianity.

If Jesus, the great ing over what their children will deliverer, lives in us, how can we eat for the next two days because be anything but charged with the a free school lunch won’t be same concern and vigor? available.</p>
<p>For too long, church culture has steamed down the channel of self-centeredness and away from community building and societal transformation. We need a radical reformation of leadership that preaches, models, and leads with a message that stirs us away from the trending ascendance of personal ambition.</p>
<p>When cultures get out of kilter and lose balance, extremes start to dominate and gain momentum. Laodicean culture in the church has done this very thing. As American wealth and appetite for more and more increased over the last three decades, social inequality did as well. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else is currently greater than in any industrialized nation. At human level the implications have been devastating. The purchasing power for the bottom quarter of the population actually decreased by 50 percent in the last twenty-five years of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>At the other end of the stick is the income of the average chief executive of a large American company, whose salary “rose approximately 500 percent, from $1.8 million to $10.6 million per annum. This income is 419 times the earnings of a typical production worker.”5 In fact, if minimum wage maintained pace with the rate increase of CEO pay scales over the last twenty years, a worker earning minimum wage would receive over $23 per hour.</p>
<p>The economic downfall at the close of the first decade of the new millennium threw the financial brakes on for just about all of America and the entire industrialized world. The church must have—in the words of Jesus—“ears to hear” if we have a true desire to make a right here, right now missional impact.</p>
<p>Misplaced Desire and Imagination Lost It wasn’t so long ago that clothing labels were on the inside of our clothing. Today, not just teenagers but middle-aged adults as well are more than happy to spend $24.95 for a Tshirt with Aeropostale or Abercrombie &#x26; Fitch emblazoned across the front. Now, in the spirit of honesty, I’ll tell one on myself. Seconds after I wrote that last sentence, I looked down and saw that I was wearing an American Eagle T-shirt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can also say that this shirt came from a thrift store. I paid two bucks for it. What is wrong with us, though?</p>
<p>What a racket we have bought into! Before we exit Joe’s Crab Shack or Cheesecake Factory, we fork over good money for a sweatshirt, paying them for the privilege of becoming a human billboard. Why do we not consider this to be insanity?</p>
<p>We have been branded on the inside... made to think that we can overcome loneliness and alienation by being part of a brand identity and community! Who’s defining us now?</p>
<p>Amid-1990’s advertising campaign for Canon cameras featured tennis star Andre Agassi with the tagline “I mage is everything.” Early capitalism has been rightly viewed as a shift from “being to having”; modern capitalist culture has gone from “having to appearing.” Guy Debord summed this up in his book The Society of the Spectacle. Debord’s argument was that commodities have taken over the imagination of society and the spectacle itself became the commodity.</p>
<p>The need to be noticed and accepted by others has trumped needs for basics.</p>
<p>The critical issue for us as Christians is that consumerism seeks to shape and dictate our identity. In the process our true personhood as strangers and aliens of God’s kingdom is snuffed out. In terms of risk, time, finance, and energy, we can’t afford to be missional. We can’t even conceive of such a life. The apostle John warned against this very thing: Don’t love the world’s ways. Don’t love the world’s goods.</p>
<p>Love of the world squeezes out love for the Father. Practically everything that goes on in the world—wanting your own way, wanting everything for yourself, wanting to appear important—has nothing to do with the Father. It just isolates you from him. The world and all its wanting, wanting, wanting is on the way out—but whoever does what God wants is set for eternity. (1 John 2:15–17 Message) Each Christmas season is met with sermons, magazine articles, and internet blogs that decry the commercialization of Christmas. Pastors preach sermons that voice disdain over Jesus’ birth being obscured by the orgy of shopping, warning followers not to take the bait. I really don’t know what all the fuss is about. Christmastime is simply a grand finale to a year’s worth of consumption. It should be no surprise that his birth is overshadowed— POSTSCRIPT for the whole year leading up to Christmas, the life of Jesus is by Alan Hirsch suppressed by consumption in the lives of his followers.</p>

I know she has no place to live and I have a spare bedroom, but that’s just not practical for me at this time in my life.” Individualism and our desire for comfort and privacy chokes out the Word and our missional imagination along with it, nullifying our effectiveness as agents of the kingdom of God. Vincent Miller wrote about the shutting down of our imagination due to our fixation with the American Dream: Two generations ago, it was not uncommon for families to raise five or more children in small, twoor three-room houses.</p>
<p>Our inability today to imagine how this was possible is a testament to the psychological skills we have lost. Now it is a common expectation that each child should have her or his own room. This social arrangement requires an enormous amount of resources and renders us less able to share our dwellings with others in hospitality. Social isolation and the burdens of maintaining a family in this system make it unlikely that other people’s needs will ever present themselves. If and when we do encounter them, we are likely to be so preoccupied with the tasks of maintaining our immediate families that we will have little time and resources to offer. The geography of the single-family home makes it very likely that we will care more about the feeding of our pets than about the millions of children who go to bed hungry around us.6 We need to recover the vision of ourselves as being made in the image of God and to shine with that image. Agassi was right; image is everything. We just must make sure we have the right image in mind.</p>
<p>Speaking of the enormous potential for being ensnared by desire for money and riches, Social action author Ronald Sider says, “Possessions are positively dangerous because they often encourage unconcern for the poor... and because they seduce people into forsaking God. Even more, they put people in the never ending loop of covetousness.”7 There is an old saying that goes, “How much does it take to make a man happy? Answer: Just a little bit more.” Consumerism trains our eyes downward to the base things of the earth. It keeps us from pursuing the things from above. The real spiritual danger here is not so much in the rightful use of a particular item but rather in the pursuit of the item. It is when we are being defined and shaped by what we consume—it’s called conspicuous consumption, and the marketers are quite deliberate in trying to shape our identity and self-worth and relate it to the product. Marketers understand this better than we do and feed the bottomless POSTSCRIPT stomach of consumers with more and more items to consume. The by Alan Hirsch objects of desire come faster and faster.

But the prevailing forms by Jesus, and the change is made of American Christianity seem abundantly clear through living in to know little of such notions.</p>

For Dream have effectively sedated most of us, this means we must most Christians, lulling them simply begin to step out beyond our into a passive, risk-averse state self-imposed barriers of safety and of comfort, safety, and security. security and risk, joining the Holy This is a drug that has numbed Spirit in what God is doing in our us to the pain and needs around neighborhoods and cities. us, needs that we often have the means to heal and meet. The very idea that living generously and courageously should be normative for Christians just sounds like crazy talk. It’s not “practical.” For most Christians, a “good Christian life” means my children believe in Jesus and actually enjoy going to church, my wife and I give 10 percent of our income to the church, we keep our car radio tuned to the Christian radio station (that, incidentally, proclaims itself as “safe for the whole family”), and we watch movies that have lots of cursing but we never use those words ourselves... out loud at least.</p>
<p>We can choose to either batten down the hatches and live a bunkered life of preserving what we have, just surviving the evils of this world. Or, we can choose to embrace our newborn identity as aliens in a strange land and pick up the mantle of living redemptively. The second choice means we embrace, rather than resist, the mindset of the Great Redeemer—Jesus Christ. It means we hold on loosely to the temporal things of the earth and we live as available agents of the kingdom of God. We will look at some ways we can do so in the next chapter.</p>
