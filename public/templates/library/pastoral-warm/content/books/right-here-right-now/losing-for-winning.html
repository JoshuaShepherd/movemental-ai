<h1>Losing for Winning</h1>
<p>Freeing Ourselves to Live Missionally</p>
<p>The only ones among you who will be truly happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.</p>
<p>Albert Schweitzer</p>
<p>Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:1 NASB</p>
<p>There are times that losing can lead to winning, and anyone who is serious about living missionally has to do just that. Like any athletic competition, to run the missional race means one must be in shape, and this almost always requires shedding extra weight. When a person is out of shape, it is difficult to breathe and oftentimes the heart struggles to work properly. The same is true when we are spiritually fat. It is hard to draw in the breath and inspiration of God, and our hearts become hardened to the economy of his kingdom. In this chapter we want to consider what some of that weight might be, along with ways we can lose it and get in missional shape.</p>
<p>Each season the television show The Biggest Loser begins with the contestants attempting a one-mile run. All of the participants are dangerously overweight and this task is monumental for each one. It seems impossible. There have been times when contestants collapsed and were taken to the hospital. At the conclusion of the season, the remaining contestants run a full marathon. Three months previously, many of them could barely complete a one-mile run and now they are able to run over twenty-six miles. They can now do something way beyond their wildest dreams because they have shed weight and adopted a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Most Americans have developed lives of excess to the point that we cannot even dream of doing some of the things we would really love to do for others because our lives are just too fat and bogged down with excess in so many ways. To engage in living missionally means we must get our lives into missional shape. A lot of people would love to be able to run a marathon, but they love eating Twinkies more. By the same token, most Christians would love to make an impact in their communities, but they have not shaped their lives to be able to keep pace.</p>
<p>By mere observation it seems clear to me that, along with Easter lilies and chirping birds, a sign that spring has sprung each year is the American institution known as the garage sale. Most North American families have enough stuff to conduct one of these events every two or three years. If you have ever been foolhardy enough to hold your own garage (or yard) sale, you know that people start knocking on your door the evening before or early the morning of your sale in order to get first shot at acquiring your stuff. We love stuff.</p>
<p>We love getting it, we love having it, and we love to search for POSTSCRIPT more. And we have so much that by Alan Hirsch we have to shed some of it every few seasons to make room for more.

For several happiness in the dust. years now I have brought this up in sermons as a passing observation, but I was blown away by the data as I began to take a closer look into the facts.</p>
<p>Labeled by some as catacombs of consumption, there are currently over 52,000 self-storage locations in the United States with revenue of over 23 billion dollars. With the fastest rate of growth in commercial real estate, it is an industry more profitable than Hollywood. One in ten American families rents self-storage units. Storage units have become the “spare tire” around the waistline of American consumption. Just imagine the needs that could be met with the disbursement of our stored stuff and the money saved on storage rental if we would abandon our addiction to stuff and adapt the practices of God’s kingdom economics. Our ability to touch the lives of others would expand greatly. Fewer goods would mean more goodness.</p>
<p>Jesus was continually warning his followers of the dangers of hoarding up for oneself: Then He said to them, “Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.” And He told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man was very productive. And he began reasoning to himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</p>
<p>And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.”’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?’ So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:15–21 NASB) This parable is a great description of the malady of Western consumption and greed. And it is critical that we call it what it is. We must begin by judging whether we are really serious about positioning ourselves to participate missionally right here and right now. The first step in breaking an addiction is to call it what it is and to admit our participation in it.</p>
<p>The sky doesn’t fall when we admit our sin and failures. It actually opens up and the clouds begin to break apart. When God brings correction and rebuke into our lives, it is not so that he can blow off steam. He chastises us out of his love and desire to get us on track to drawing our life out of the well of himself.</p>

<p>Be Unconformed to Be Transformed</p>

<p>In Luke 16:13 Jesus says, “No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve POSTSCRIPTGod and wealth” (NASB). Just by Alan Hirsch a few verses following this one, Jesus tells a parable about a rich man who ignored a poor beggar

The apostle Paul than God intended. warned of this: “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect” (Rom. 12:2 NASB).</p>
<p>This verse points out that when we allow ourselves to be shaped and overly influenced by the host culture, not only are our minds not transformed by the thoughts of God, but we find it difficult if not impossible to discern his will for our lives. It has become hard for most Christians in the West to dream missionally, much less discern God’s marching orders for their lives because they are so tied to the kingdom of the present age that their minds are numb to his Word. As Vincent Miller says, “The abstraction inherent in consumer desire absorbs not only our own ability to determine how much is enough but also our ability to engage the needs of others.”1 The good news... no... the great news is that we don’t have to continue this way. We can “unconform” and position ourselves to live missionally right now.</p>
<h2>Think “Redeem”</h2>
<p>Anyone who has seen the movie Schindler’s List will remember the touching scene near the end of the movie. Leaving the factory where he has spent his fortune bribing the German SS in order to secure the lives of Jewish workers, Oskar Schindler breaks down as he looks upon the faces of the people he has saved (over 1,100 people) and then upon the car he is about to enter. He begins to weep, and mumbles, “This car... ten more people.” He staggers and clutches at the gold lapel pen on his blazer. “This pen... two more people.” He cries, “I could have done more. I could have done more...” Schindler had developed a mindset of redemption. His situation was rare in that there was an actual tradeoff of people’s lives for possessions. He could literally redeem people’s lives in exchange for money or valuables.</p>
<p>Most of us will never face such a situation to the extent that Oskar Schindler did, but every day we do have a choice of how to spend our lives, our possessions, and our finances.</p>
<p>We can bring redemption to people’s lives if we steward our resources in that direction. Our lives are full of choices that determine our ability to participate in mission and mission’s purpose—redemption. Our heavenly Father is a restoring God. He is the mender of hearts and the advocate of the least and the lost, and Jesus’ agenda was all about this very thing.</p>
<p>Scripture instructs us to have the same mindset as Jesus (Phil.</p>
<p>2:5). So, if we are true to our born-again nature, we will seek ways to redeem broken people and situations that are within our power or influence.</p>
<p>Throughout the Bible we see the redemptive nature of God.</p>
<p>Just observe his hand upon Abraham’s offspring, specifically the nation of Israel, which was to be a light to the Gentiles (Isa. 49:6). As history progressed, God’s redemptive plan unfolded. Following the death and resurrection of Jesus, the church was born and the next phase of redemption was revealed. Access to God would no longer be through a single nation or temple. God had now moved into a spiritual temple, his redeemed people from all nations. This is where we—the church—come in.</p>
<p>Redemption itself is in us, and we not only have the opportunity, but also the obligation, to spread it wherever we go.</p>
<p>It is not relegated to our church buildings, systems, or clergy members. It is in every single one of us, right here, right now.</p>
<p>Redemption needs no organization or ordination. It simply needs a host. It can be dispersed and released through the life of any Christ follower. As redemption-minded people, we will look at those around us, from the workplace to the grocery store, as those we hope to spread the peace of God upon. Ronald Sider, Philip Olson, and Heidi Unruh point to Jeremiah’s letter to the captive exiles of Israel:</p>
<h2>Jeremiah passed on the Lord’s instructions to the exiles:</h2>
<p>“Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters” (Jer.</p>
<p>29:5–6). The exiled Israelites were to provide for basic necessities such as food and housing and to rebuild their shattered family lives. Then God called them to go a step farther: “Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare” (v. 7). As the Israelites worked to meet personal and family needs, they were also to seek the good of their new home city. God’s plan for the Israelites rested not just on their personal well-being but on their becoming a positive influence on the wider society.2</p>
<h2>Rich toward God</h2>
<p>To start with, we must decide we are going to do this. We must make our minds up that we will disentangle ourselves from the suffocating weight that comes with living an overly consumptive lifestyle. We make a choice to break free in order to live redemptively. This requires an honest evaluation of the differences between our needs and wants and how we use what we have for redemptive purposes. We must decide whether we would prefer to gather treasures for earthly living or invest in heavenly treasure, being rich toward God. And a hint for where to lay up heavenly treasure is to recognize that the only things that will last forever are not even things; they are people. So if we desire to lay up treasures in heaven, we need to look to how we can affect the lives of others.</p>
<p>My wife and I are continually amazed as we watch television shows that track people’s searches for a new house. Time and time again the pursuit of a larger house comes about as couples discover they have a first or second child on the way.</p>
<p>In many cases the house they live in is quite large, but the default mode is, “We have a child on the way... we need more space.” It’s as if the pregnancy test included drinking some wacked-out “you need more space” Kool-aid.</p>
<p>Over the last half-century Americans have been conditioned to believe that they need larger and larger houses. The first Levittown subdivision homes following World War II contained 750 square feet. “By the ’60s 1,100 square feet was typical, and by the ’70s, 1,350. Now it’s 2,469.”3 Compare this to the average home size in the United Kingdom, which is just over 750 square feet. For some reason we have come to believe we must have more and more personal space. My best guess is that the desire for independence and privacy drives this.
POSTSCRIPT When purchasing a home or a by Alan Hirsch vehicle, the tendency is to make choices based on the maximum amount of money we can obtain God is the Creator. One of the through credit. This is what we exciting things is that we are being deem “affordable.” Structuring like God when we are creative, and our lives in this way means we one of the ways in which we are are left with little to nothing creative is to use our imaginations. with which to live missionally The fundamental job of the and respond to spontaneous sanctified imagination is to create needs we happen upon.

We will base purchasing decisions on missional limits. We will look at our living expenses and ask what we can afford in order to live missionally. We add missional living to our budget and take it into consideration as we make major purchases or significant lifestyle decisions. For just about everyone, the largest financial investment we have is our home. It is usually our most valuable asset and therefore we should consider how to use it for kingdom means.</p>
<h2>Many Ways, But One Purpose</h2>
<p>As we consider what living this way means for our families and us personally, it is important to keep in mind that the Spirit of God works in a wide variety of ways. It is easy to draw on situations and stories we see in the Bible and assume they are commandments. This is the classic descriptive versus prescriptive mistake. There are many situations in Scripture that explain “what” happened without God telling us to do the same. Jesus once used spit to make a dab of mud and put it on a blind man’s eye, restoring his sight. But Jesus didn’t tell us to “go and do likewise.” God leads his people in many diverse ways and as we consider how to use the stuff we have for the purposes of God, we need to recognize this in our own lives as well as the lives of others.</p>
<p>It just may be that God wants you to have a large house with several bedrooms in order to be able to respond to folks who are without a home and need help getting back on their feet. I’ve known several families, including my own parents, who opened their homes up to people who needed a roof over their heads for a period of time. When they moved to the US, Alan and Deb were welcomed into the home of some dear friends who are empty nesters, where they lived for two years.</p>
<p>Mike and Rita have made a significant investment in Alan and Deb’s ministry and are partners in their fruit. Making a choice for housing, when viewed from the perspective of missional Christianity, will mean a commitment to live in the overflow of the good news of the kingdom of God. Western Seminary professor James Brownson points out the many ways the Holy Spirit inspires us to live “kingdomly”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In living out its life under the cross, the early church found

</blockquote>
<p>Brownson’s description celebrates the creativity of God in the lives of Christ followers who are open and obedient to his ways and means in their lives. We need both a radically lean way of living by some disciples and an elaborate abundance shared by others. Brownson lists several authentic needs for a kingdom economy to manifest:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need people who are called to a radical simplicity</li>
</ul>
<p>of lifestyle, to remind the rest of us that we don’t need what we think we need.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need people committed to celibacy, to tell us that</li>
</ul>
<p>sex is neither a necessity nor a god.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need people who are lavish in prayer and spiritual</li>
</ul>
<p>disciplines, in order to remind those of us with harder spirits of where our real help comes from.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need communities of Christians willing to commit</li>
</ul>
<p>themselves to support each other in risky, venturesome ways, to goad the rest of us out of our autonomy.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need Christians willing to resist the many ways in</li>
</ul>
<p>which the dominant in our world crush the weak.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need Christians who find a thousand joyful ways to</li>
</ul>
<p>take the screwed-up values of this world and turn them upside down.5</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of the recent economic recession in the United States, the worst situation since the Great Depression, has been the loss of homes through foreclosure and the inability to pay rent. The housing market has made it very difficult to sell a house for those who would like to downsize.</p>
<p>But what if we were to look at the current situation as an opportunity to flex our missional muscles? You may not be able to move into a home that is less expensive, but you very well may have extra space or you might be able to make extra space by having your children share a bedroom.</p>
<p>Austin and Brian Chu are two brothers who recently traveled across the United States filming a documentary about the current recession titled The Recess Ends. They traveled in a small van and relied on the generosity of friends and strangers for lodging. One family who provided food and shelter was the Frankels, of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Chris and Georgia Frankel were once in a situation where they had to rely on friends and family to get by but are now in a more solid financial position and are living their lives in a pay-it-forward mode. In addition to their own three children, the couple shares their home with five adults and two teenagers.</p>
<p>But even with a lifestyle Chris describes as “living paycheck to paycheck,” the couple say they are fortunate to have a large house (it’s more than 3,800 square feet) that has become a haven for those living there. “People were there for us and helped us when we needed it,” Chris said. “We wanted to do the same.”... The couple has converted spare rooms into bedrooms to accommodate everyone, and even with a food bill that averages about $1,000 a month, Georgia swears she wouldn’t have it any other way. “I feel like everyone needs a good environment to live in,” Georgia said. “We have a home we were blessed with, and it has a lot of room for everybody.</p>
<p>We work well as a family.”... “My kids get to experience different cultures and different kinds of people,” [Chris] said.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, if it comes down between saving a dollar or helping someone else out, we have been pretty good about seeing the investment in our friendships and our family.</p>
<p>That’s what keeps us going and keeps us pretty happy.”6</p>

<p>I’ve often thought that Jesus could have entered Jerusalem on a large white stallion. Instead, the humble carpenter chose a baby donkey for his triumphal entry.

<h2>Kingdom Economics</h2>
<p>God has revealed to us the way a society should live. Astudy of thebook of Deuteronomy paints a picture of a culture with lifestyle habits that make for a sustainable and workable life. One of the things I love about this picture is not only a generous and caring society for one’s fellow man but also the idea of the Sabbath and the feasts. God is no prude. He demands we work for a living, but for reasons of social justice and spirituality, he also demands that we rest. He demands we share and live selflessly, but he also requires that we always take extended breaks and throw parties.</p>
<p>Afew years ago I decided to lose some extra weight. Untucked shirts hid the flab above my belt, but I knew it was there and that it was unhealthy. I also knew “dieting” was not the answer. Diets are only temporary fixes and almost always leave the person reverting to old habits and the previous form. I chose a program that would carve out a healthy lifestyle of eating right, good foods, combined with good exercise. One of the things I loved about the disciplines in the system I chose was that it provides for a “free” day—a type of a Sabbath from the “work” of living healthy. This means that one day a week I can eat anything I choose. If I want bacon and hash browns for breakfast, coconut pie at lunch, followed by dinner at my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant, then I can go for it.</p>
<p>The first week I was on the program I couldn’t wait until my free day. I went straight to Whataburger (the best hamburger in the world, none of that nonsense about In-N-Out Burger—this is something Alan and I both agree strongly on and it is a closed discussion) and guess what? I couldn’t finish the meal. After six days my body had already begun to change and wanted less of what was really not good for me in excess. As I moved forward this dynamic continued, and my desires and “tastes” began to change. From that point on I didn’t live for the free day. But when I was with friends or family on a special occasion, I was able to feast and enjoy with no guilt.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when we develop a lifestyle of living missionally. We can still enjoy the fruit of our labor, but we develop new appetites that are in check, not out of control. God carves out an economic design for our lives that is full of life for others and ourselves. In How to I nherit the Earth, Scott Bessenecker says: Those who are meek and who are submitted to the government of God will seek for his kingdom to come before all else, because they treasure this kingdom more than they treasure personal wealth. They are attentive to those who are weak and who are trampled underfoot by the powerful. They turn into great centrifuges of wealth, spinning their possessions out to those in need and stretching their arms out to those on the margins of society. This isn’t trickle-down economics where a few at the top might slop some of what they have accumulated over the edge so that a drop or two trickles down to the masses at the bottom. Kingdom economics is pictured in the poor widow who was so insanely generous that she gave away the little she had to live on (Mark 12:41–44). In kingdom economics the followers of Jesus pool their resources and then dole them out to each one as they have need (Acts 4:32–34). Widows and orphans are cared for in their distress (James 1:27). Homes are open for the homeless and clothing is given away to those who need it (Matthew 25:35–36). The economic blueprint in God’s kingdom works against personal increase and selfish accumulation and works toward distribution out to the extremities. Perhaps that’s why Jesus said that it was impossible to serve both God and money; people can’t submit to the desire for personal accumulation and submit to the desire for God at the same time.7</p>
<p>Living productive kingdom lives requires that we change our habits and lifestyles. Junk food and easy chairs don’t produce world-class athletes. If we jump into the race and fail to reorient our lives in tune with missional disciplines and practices, we will most likely fall out of the race completely, thinking it is an impossible and miserable task. But by retraining our minds, attitudes, and hearts in combination with actions and disciplines that are otherly oriented, we will be able to shape our lives into good news wherever we are.</p>

<h2>Budget for mission—</h2>
<p>I recall Tony Campolo once telling the story of his family budget. Early in their marriage he and his wife made the decision to live on a conservative budget in order to bless others. They chose to drive used cars and live in a modest home. Over the years they adjusted their budget according to the national cost of living, but in spite of Tony’s fame and increased income, they continued to live modestly and give the overflow away. Today they live on about $50,000 per year and give the rest away. This would be a wonderful decision for young couples to adopt as they begin their lives together.</p>
<p>It would also be a great decision for anyone to downsize toward.</p>
