<h1>Oh Raaaawb!</h1>
<h2>When Things Go Wrong in the Suburbs</h2>
<p>It occurs to me that this is not a neighborhood; it is only a collection of unconnected individuals.</p>
<p>—Philip Langdon, A Better Place to Live</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As suburban living surged in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the airwaves were filled with idyllic portrayals of American families exercising their right to pursue happiness. Shows like Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, Hazel, Leave It to Beaver... it seemed every television show featured the perfect suburban lifestyle featuring television shows with squeaky-clean families where Mom always looked as though they had just returned from the beauty parlor, always had fresh-baked cookies prepared for after-school snacks, and had dinner ready when</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dad came home from work. Commercial breaks featured the stars of the shows, still in character, plying the products that helped them live such a happy life.</p>
<p>Somewhere in our minds, though bedrooms were almost never shown, we had to figure that whatever did happen in there must be working pretty good too, because Dad always seemed happy. It was amazing how Mom put so much into her days, but still seemed to have plenty left for the evening.</p>
<p>No pressure for the American housewife here, huh?</p>
<p>One of the most popular suburban-based television shows of all time was The Dick Van Dyke Show, featuring Mary Tyler Moore as Laura Petrie. Here was a “typical” housewife who just happened to look like Jackie Kennedy, dance like Ginger Rogers, sing like Judy Garland, and cook like Julia Childs. Who wouldn’t want Laura Petrie as a wife? Though every crisis was sure to be solved in thirty minutes or less, they always began with Laura’s signature vibrato cry, calling to her husband, “Oh Raaaaawwwb!” This meant something had gone terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Well, something has gone wrong in suburban life, and it’s gone wrong for suburban Christianity as well.</p>
<h2>Welcome to the Burbs</h2>
<p>I clearly remember the formative months of the church plant I led in the mid-1990s and pastored for the next ten years. Our planting team was moving from a small college town ninety miles west to the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri. We were headed to the fastest-growing county in the state at the time, and the suburban landscape sprawled for miles and miles in cluster after cluster of subdivisions housing the 250,000 and growing residents. These new neighborhoods had names that made a person feel both safe and successful—Hunter’s Glenn, Walnut Creek, The Vineyards, Spencer’s Crossing, The Bluffs. This was the place where we would embark on our church-planting mission.</p>
<p>By this time my wife Sherri and I had three small children and we made the painful decision to sell our treasured 1966 Mustang coupe and buy... you guessed it... a minivan.</p>
<p>For a thirty-year-old man, the phrase “Buy a minivan” is tantamount to “Eat your broccoli.” Gag. This is the point in a man’s life when everything changes. There’s no looking back. He might as well begin to wear white button-down shirts, black horn-rimmed glasses, and get a pocket protector stamped “Vernie Keel Funeral Home.” Welcome to the dweeb zone, buddy. All vestiges of youth are laid to rest when a guy capitulates and buys a minivan.</p>
<p>Our move was still a few weeks away, and I had not personally met a “specimen” of the typical person we were planting a church to reach. My first encounter came about as I replied to a newspaper ad for a minivan and drove east for two hours to check it out. It happened to be located in the heart of the area we were moving to. The directions given by the lady that placed the ad led me through a maze of concrete trails to a two-story colonial with sprinkler heads that recessed into the ground as I pulled up.</p>
<p>In the driveway sat a sparkling green Mercury minivan that was less than a year old. Just what we were looking for.</p>
<p>Before I could even ring the doorbell, Ken and Barbie greeted me, although they used aliases. They were perfect. All that was missing was the pink Cadillac.</p>
<p>I was invited inside, offered a soda, and introduced to their two toddlers as Barbie shared her sadness about selling her beloved minivan. I told her I was even sadder for needing to buy it, and she tilted her head and looked at me like a confused poodle. Ken pitched me the keys and the two of us went out for a test drive. As we drove along, he shared with me the reason he and Barbie were selling the van. I asked him if he was tired of broccoli. He also looked at me like a confused poodle and told me they had recently sold their house, were moving to a larger home, and were anticipating some financial pressure. The increased house payment that came with the larger home created the need to POSTSCRIPT sell the van. They planned to buy something less expensive. by Alan Hirsch “Why are you buying a bigger house?” I asked. “More kids on Many—if not most—times when we the way?” I figured they probably purchase houses, cars (or a second were expecting their third child or car), clothing, and electronics, we at least were planning on having are indulging in consumption of another one in the future. “No, much more than basic needs. If we that’s been taken care of... snip, choose to be honest, the truth is, snip... you know,” Ken winked we are satisfying latent desires for and told me. “It’s just that we’ve status and identity. The pursuit of got a lot of stuff in storage, we’re thinking about getting a boat... fulfillment and happiness through I don’t know, we just need more materialism is the driving reason space,” he said. behind most of our brand choices.</p>
<p>I told him I figured it must be This has much more to do with our tough, having to leave friends buying decisions than the filling of from the neighborhood, but basic needs. he said they had lived there for only about three years and really didn’t know anybody anyway, so they didn’t feel they were leaving much behind. Ken explained that they were moving into a new subdivision of executive homes in a gated community. The new house had 3500 square feet of living space and a three-car garage, while the present home had only 2600 square feet and a two-car garage.</p>
<p>The conversation eventually swung to my side as he asked what I did for a living. After I explained that no, a church planter is not a landscaper for churches, but that we were coming to the area to start a new church, Ken shook his head and raised his eyebrows, saying, “Good luck. You’re gonna have a hell of a hard time around here because most people in this area are like me. They’re overworked, in major debt, and don’t have much time for church.” I was pretty quiet for the remainder of the test drive.</p>
<p>Driving back home, the reality of this new mission field quieted my soul. “Geeze, this may be harder than I thought,” I mumbled to myself. It was as if God was using Barbie and Ken as a wake-up call for me to know what I was facing. My vision was not to just grow a cool, large church (though I wanted a cool, large church). I wanted to reach people who were not fully engaged in following Jesus. I wanted to see them not only come to belief and trust in him as a savior, I wanted to help them become full-bore disciples, taking on the agenda of the reign of God—an otherly focused lifestyle.</p>
<p>It was at this point I began to realize that although the suburbs I saw with my eyes displayed example after example of perfectly manicured lawns, medians, and street corners, the spiritual fields were full of towering, choking weeds and thickets. Jesus’ words exploded in my heart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seed cast in the weeds represents the ones who hear the
kingdom news but are overwhelmed with worries about all
the things they have to do and all the things they want to get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stress strangles what they heard, and nothing comes of it. (Mark 4:18–19 Message)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking back, I realize it should have been one of the top
things I considered, but this was the first time I was confronted
with the state of the church planting soil I would be working
culture that works against growing missional followers of Jesus,
must be applied here as well—not the least of which is to know
with the Lord. Weeds, rocks, stumps, and thistles are all around</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Planting on the Moon</h2>
<p>When my wife and I started our first garden, we had a soil test conducted, and the fellow who reported the results said, “You’re trying to grow stuff on the moon.” That’s how bad it was. Our soil had a lot of clay and required us to till and mix in several additives. We made the necessary adjustments to the soil and ended up with a great garden. But the first vital step was for us to really understand the situation we were facing.</p>
<p>It was not enough for us to simply plant seeds and hope for a harvest. Neither was it enough for us to have top-quality seeds or to faithfully water and nurture them.</p>
<p>In like manner, we needed a realistic understanding of the culture—the soil—we were working with. This is the situation facing suburban Christians and leaders today. Many aspects of the cultural soil in the suburbs are not conducive to generating a healthy harvest. We absolutely can develop missional lives in the suburbs, but we must begin by evaluating our “dirt.” Suburbs came about as cities mushroomed in growth, spreading to outlying areas away from the hearts of cities, and as cars became affordable for just about anyone. This led to designs that were not only car-friendly but also car-necessary. Today, if you want to live in or visit someone in the suburbs, you are better off getting there by car, motorcycle, bike, or helicopter. If you walk, it’s going to be a long hike. Most suburban subdivisions have only one or two entries, as a series of cul-de-sacs are typically merged together to form most modern-day neighborhoods. “Older street networks such as grid plans, commonly used in development until the Second World War, have been dismissed by traffic engineers because their many intersections allow traffic of all kinds to flow on minor streets as well as major thoroughfares. The new street hierarchy—called a sparse hierarchy by some because it severely limits the number of through routes—promises more order and efficiency.”1 The neighborhood I grew up in was based on one of the older grid systems for streets. This meant that a lot of passthrough traffic occurred. As a youngster in the 1970s, my friends and I had a lot of fun with the poor souls who drove through our neighborhood. More than once we pulled the old purse-on-a-string trick, where we would lay a woman’s purse in the middle of the street at nighttime with nylon fishing line attached. (This prank is older than the whoopee cushion, but still funny.) As we hid in nearby bushes, a driver would stop and exit his car to check out the purse and just as the guy was about to pick it up we would yank on the line. This usually elicited a startled jump followed by a symphony of cursing as the guy with the found-and-lost fortune looked in vain to find who had just duped him. We would run and, laughing hysterically, fall into the tall grassy fields nearby.</p>
<p>The newer suburbs combine zoning ordinances with culde-sacs to minimize unnecessary traffic, making for quieter and safer living. Parents feel pretty secure in letting their children play in the cul-de-sac, as vehicular, drive-past traffic is minimal and most of the cars that do come through are carrying residents of that street. Drive through a neighborhood that you don’t live in and there’s a good chance you will interrupt a street hockey or football game. As you pass through, the kids will look at you like you’re crazy—“What’s wrong with that guy? Driving through here like that. It’s like he thinks this a road or something.” In the modern suburb there is no neighborhood Starbucks or drugstore. Marketplace activity is funneled to shopping centers and malls. Grocery stores, banks, drugstores, coffee shops, pubs, and schools are located outside of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>This means people don’t drive through on their way to another place or cross through as a shortcut for other destinations. For the most part the people who drive there live there.</p>
<h2>Life in Silos</h2>
<p>Prior to modern suburban design and zoning categories, living was done across a rather seamless landscape. People were significantly connected to others beyond their immediate family through a network of relationships that were formed as a natural byproduct of daily living. There was consistent and genuine connection with others. People frequently interacted with one another as they walked to the neighborhood drugstore, pub, or corner market. As they were on their way, off-the-cuff conversations took place with neighbors sitting on their front porches having morning coffee or catching an afternoon breeze. This was just one of the ways people got to know one another. Over the years friendships developed and true community was nurtured and developed.</p>
<p>Sociologists have a term—social capital—that is a measure of the degree that people are connected in social networks, as well as the overall value of those relationships. Author David Halpern defines social capital: Most people are embedded in a series of different social networks and associations. We have friends. We go to work and mix with colleagues. We may belong to a union or professional association that keeps us in touch with similar professionals outside of our own work context. In our leisure time, we may play a sport with a particular group or club, and we may belong to other interest-based groups, whether this interest is knitting, model railways or astro-physics. We may also belong to a political party, or more frequently, to a pressure group working to save whales, the environment, or the right to carry weapons. And in our home life, we are part of a family, a neighborhood, and probably a religious or ethnic community too. These everyday networks, including many of the social customs and bonds that define them and keep them together, are what we mean when we talk about social capital.2</p>
<p>Social capital has waned over the years as relationships began to take on boundaries across the landscape of community cultures. Take the typical suburban neighborhood, for example. Neighborly relationships began to thin as central air-conditioning and television sets took their place in most homes. The front porch became obsolete as people left the porch swing for the recliner, developing “friendships” with the Bunkers, the Waltons, and the crew at Cheers. It wasn’t long before zoning codes and cul-de-sacs made sidewalks obsolete and unnecessary for most suburban neighborhoods. They were
POSTSCRIPT no longer needed because there by Alan Hirsch was no place to walk to anyway.</p>
<p>The term single-family home describes suburban housing

Strangers lowing generations look at their really stress us out. Though this homes.

Our cultural My introvertish, more self-procomfort once again trumps the tective nature doesn’t want or kingdom—an idol is born. expect people to drop by unannounced. And years of living on cul-de-sacs have done little but feed my selfish side. But I’ve noticed that my parents and people from their generation usually give no thought when friends stop by without calling first. Many times I’ve witnessed my parents’ friends drop in, unannounced, on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and stay until late evening. In no time, my mother would have snacks and drinks out for everyone. One of the first questions she would ask is, “Can you stay for dinner?” Modern suburban life doesn’t foster such a mindset of hospitality. Quite the opposite, it reinforces the desire for privacy.</p>
<p>Avariety of silos serve as containers for commerce, employment, worship, exercise, education, and so forth. They are most always zoned out of the residential neighborhood. This results in a life that becomes compartmentalized. We live multiple lives (e. g., home life, work life, church life, exercise life) among different sets of people. So, the people we live near are usually not the same people with whom we work, shop, or worship. There is no genuine network of relationships, just sets of relationships.</p>
<p>It all creates a mentality whereby our identities constantly shift and change in light of the moment or social setting.</p>
<p>Peter Block points to the findings of Bowling Alone author Robert Putnam and his research on social capital in I talian towns: His findings were startling, for he discovered that the one thing that distinguished the more successful from the less successful towns was the extent of social capital, or widespread relatedness that existed among its citizens. Success as a town was not dependent on the town’s geography, history, economic base, cultural inheritance, or financial resources.</p>
<p>Putnam shows how we have become increasingly disconnected from family, friends, neighbors, and our democratic structures—and how we may reconnect. He warns that our stock of social capital—the very fabric of our connections with each other—has plummeted, impoverishing our lives and communities. Geography, history, great leadership, fine programs, economic advantage, and any other factors that we traditionally use to explain success made a marginal difference in the health of a community. Community well-being simply had to do with the quality of the relationships, the cohesion that exists among its citizens. He calls this social capital.3</p>
<h2>Fragmented Lifestyles</h2>
<p>For authentic community to marinate, we need a mix of people with various skills and interests coming together and rubbing off on one another. Silo living breeds social disintegration. It fosters a life that segregates our relationships with others and limits intermingling among the people in our differing silos. relationships relationships relationships relationships relationships Excercise Shopping Church</p>

<p>It’s hard to integrate such a wide variety of relationships from so many differing compartments. Life becomes a churning machine, made up of many parts, rather than an organic and holistic body of life.</p>
<p>How does church fit into this? The people there are not the same people from the other compartments of our lives, so church leaders struggle to create a sense of community.</p>
<p>There is very little, if any, social capital to begin with. In all the years I was on staff at churches and served as a pastor, one of the most common issues we struggled over had to do with getting our members to really connect with and know each other. We would host special events—guy’s nights, gal’s nights, single’s nights, blue-eyed people nights, and peoplewith-tires-on their-cars nights—anything to get people rubbing shoulders with one another.</p>
<p>The most common community-building solution for many churches is a small group ministry. If it were not for the intentional and sacrificial efforts of church members who host and lead small groups, there would be virtually no semblance of community whatsoever in most midsize to larger American churches. Still, very few small POSTSCRIPT groups come anywhere close to developing genuine commuby Alan Hirsch nity.

<p>Most often the people at church are not the same people we are interacting with in our day-to-day lives. They are just the people with whom we are doing church. It’s not as though our lives depend on one another (though they should). People tend to take the same mentality that the guy I bought the minivan from had toward moving from his neighborhood.</p>
<p>Often people lose so little relationally when they move on, they can easily find another place to do church.</p>
<h2>My Little Town</h2>
<p>Although I was raised in the suburbs of the Dallas/Forth Worth area, I spent a lot of time with my grandparents, about an hour’s drive to the north, in a small one-horse town. The extreme opposite of the disintegrated life we experience today, theirs was a community with a rich mixture of integrated living. Era, Texas, was my favorite place in the world. To this very day if I’m drifting melancholy, I sometimes lie down, listening to Van Morrison or Paul Mc Cartney, and daydream up a visit to 1972 at Grandma and Granddad’s house.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve had the experience of living in a small town or have visited a place where neighbors weren’t afraid or embarrassed to borrow a cup of sugar, or on short notice to ask a neighbor to watch the kids for an hour. Era was that type of place. It was a town where everyone knew everyone’s everything. But it was a good kind of knowing and neighbors not only were at the ready to share tools, kitchen goods, and a helping hand; they even (as late as the early 1980s) had a party line phone system. You had to be careful what you said on the phone because it was as good as tapped. Miss Elmira was a pro at listening in on other people’s conversations without being detected.</p>
<p>Along with weeks at a time during the summer, I would also spend a couple of weekends per month at my grandparents’ home. During these little visits it was common to see my grandparents and their neighbors borrowing and sharing. In a typical week several friends would drop by, unannounced, to share a glass of iced tea or cup of coffee. Many times they would drop off vegetables or fruit, maybe a watermelon or a bag of peaches or pecans. During the holiday season neighbors were constantly stopping by one another’s houses to share baked goods. And great-uncles and aunts with crinkly faces like chicken-fried steak would supply my sister and me with those Life Saver candy books or coloring books and the fat crayons.</p>
<p>In a crisis people were there for one another. I was around one late-summer morning when the teenage girls from next door knocked frantically on my grandparents’ front door. Their mother had been canning fruit and spilled a pot of boiling water across her chest, leaving severe burns. The family didn’t have medical insurance and Grandma cared for her wounds and nursed her back to health over a period of several weeks.</p>
<p>The lone grocery store in town was owned and run by a kind snowy-topped man named Jack Alexander. Granddad plowed his cornfields in the summer and fall, and I still love the scent of butane because it reminds me of the smell that came from his John Deere tractor. Two or three times per week Grandma or Granddad would walk “to town” and the halfmile trip always included at least three stops. First would be Alexander’s Store to pick up various foodstuffs or household goods. Adjacent to the checkout counter was a small kitchen table around which a few old men in overalls usually gathered.</p>
<p>Between chaws of tobacco they would fret about the Texas heat, cuss Nixon, and eat Moon Pies, washing them down with Dr Pepper with peanuts floating in the bottle.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the post office. I’ve seen toolsheds bigger than the little tan bricked structure that was run by the widow, Ruby Hudspeth. But I loved to go inside and look at the bad guys posted on the wall and I always got to open the little brass door—Box 61—that was my grandparents’ mail slot. Ruby was my grandparent’s next-door neighbor to the west and she always kept a bowl of Tootsie Rolls and candy corn on the counter for the kids. There was no need for Twitter in those days, because Ruby always shared the latest and best details on the happenings in Era.</p>
<p>Across the lot from the post office was the last stop on the way back home. George’s Garage had a single gas pump, a holdover from the fifties that still had the Ethyl sign on top.</p>
<p>Outside, next to the door to the station, there was always a card table with a group of old-timers entrenched in a domino game, and George would look out from under the hood of a car and tell you if the fish were biting and what the weather was going to do the next day.</p>
<p>The round-trip would take about an hour and a half—ten minutes of walking, ten minutes of shopping, and an hour or so of conversations. This was just a way of life, and although my grandparents had very little in material possessions, they were rich in community and had very little stress.</p>

<p>Self-Reliance and the Nuclear Family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t until the mid-twentieth century that people began to transfer from one single-family home to another with the frequency we see nowadays. This phenomenon severed links to networks in neighborhoods, and families actually began losing stability along the way. Prior to this, the neighborhood and surrounding community network was considered to be a critical cog in the support structure for families. Families viewed themselves as integrated within the community as a whole. But unbridled individualism and consumption changed this notion.</p>
<p>Convenience stores and 24-hour shops of many types began to sprinkle the suburban landscape and mindsets changed. Why bother my neighbor for a cup of sugar when I can be back from the 7-Eleven in less time? I would probably be drawn into a conversation with her, and who has time for mindless chitchat?</p>
<p>I’ve got Facebooking to get to after I’m done with these cookies. And why would the neighbor across the street borrow my chain saw? He can get one of his own with no payments and no interest for the next eighteen months at the Home Depot.</p>

I nterdependence sounds good in speeches and sermons, but the common reality in North America is that it’s every man, woman, and child for themselves. It wasn’t always this way. In fact, it hasn’t been this way for long. Historian Stephanie Coontz writes:</p>

<p>Christmas seems to have been more a time for attending parties and dances than for celebrating family solidarity. Only in the twentieth century did the family come to be the center of festive attention and emotional intensity.4 It may be surprising to know the nostalgic images we hold of 1950s families were actually new phenomena at the time.</p>
<p>We think of them as the end of an era—the good old days.</p>
<p>Truth is, they were the beginning of an era. The lifestyle of television families such as Ozzie and Harriet, the Cleavers, and the Andersons were a product of the post-war consumer boom. By the mid-1950s, about 60 percent of the American population was at a middle-class income level. Coontz points out, “The increase in single-family homeownership between 1946 and 1956 outstripped the increase during the entire preceding century and a half. By 1960, 62 percent of American families owned their own homes, in contrast to 43 percent in 1940. Eighty-five percent of the new homes were built in the suburbs, where the nuclear family found new possibilities for privacy and togetherness.”5 Like a sideshow carnival barker, television and marketing voices promoted the idea of the single-family home and the nuclear family as the answer to everyone’s dreams. It was a marriage made in heaven for advertisers, the textile industry, manufacturers of furniture and appliances, and the home building industry.</p>
<p>Social workers endorsed nuclear family separateness and looked suspiciously on active extended-family networks. Popular commentators urged young families to adopt a “modern” stance and strike out on their own, and with the return of prosperity, most did. By the early 1950s, newlyweds not only were establishing single-family homes at an earlier age and a more rapid rate than ever before but also were increasingly moving to the suburbs, away from the close scrutiny of the elder generation. The values of 1950s families also were new.</p>
<p>The emphasis on producing a whole world of satisfaction, amusement, and inventiveness within the nuclear family had no precedents. Historian Elain Tyler May comments, “The legendary family of the 1950s... was not, as common wisdom tells us, the last gasp of ‘traditional’ family life with deep roots in the past. Rather, it was the first wholehearted effort to create a home that would fulfill virtually all its members’ personal needs through an energized and expressive personal life.”6</p>
<p>Author Philip Langdon points to the influence of marketing and advertising industries as a strategic shaper of the American consumer: “Since mastering the basics of psychology in the 1920s, the marketing profession has spent several decades honing its ability to manipulate our apprehensions about our attractiveness, social status, and other attributes. The latent worries are stirred by seductive commercial messages whose underlying theme is: Buy or be incomplete.”7 Today the nuclear family is king of priority hill in American culture. And American Christian culture follows lockstep, suffering the consequences. The very notion that Alan and I would call into question the family unit as deserving top billing will be viewed as suspicious by some and anathema by others.</p>
<p>The accepted and engrained American ideal is that people can be healthy and whole by developing a single-family home, and if some degree of community building happens in the family’s spare time (which they have POSTSCRIPT none of) and with the spare dime (which they have none of), then by Alan Hirsch that’s just icing on the cake.</p>

Stephanie Sociologist Christopher Lash calls Coontz observes, “People move it “our haven in a heartless world.” from job to job, following a career path that shuffles them from one single-family home to another and does not link them to neighborly networks beyond the family.”8 Most people would be hard pressed to provide the names and occupations of the neighbors living on either side of them and across the street from their house, much less other neighbors farther down the street in the neighborhood. Philip Langdon cites psychologist Philip G. Zimbardo, observing that “approximately 40 percent of the population consider themselves shy. If neighbors on the cul-de-sac do not want to become friendly with them or do not have time for socializing, the shy man or woman ends up more isolated than ever.”9 It is no wonder that we have such a depressed and drugged society in the West. The US Centers for Disease Control reports that more than one in every twenty persons aged twelve or older currently suffers depression.10 I’m no psychologist, but it is reasonable to surmise that the lack of genuine community and relationships beyond the single-family home are a contributing factor to the malaise of depression in our society.</p>
<p>Other researchers have also determined that the pursuit of happiness is a race many Americans are losing and point to a lack of relational connection as part of the cause.</p>
<p>Americans are less happy today than they were 30 years ago thanks to longer working hours and a deterioration in the quality of their relationships with friends and neighbors. And while the average American paycheck had risen over the past 30 years, its happiness-boosting benefits were more than offset by a drop in the quality of relationships over the period. “The main cause is a decline in the so-called social capital—increased loneliness, increased perception of others as untrustworthy and unfair,” said Stefano Bartolini, one of the authors of the study. “Social contacts have worsened, people have less and less relationships among neighbors, relatives and friends.”11</p>
<h2>Void of Social Dependence</h2>
<p>Americans are noted worldwide for their fierce spirit of independence. This quality or character is both loved and loathed by Americans and non-Americans alike. It really is a double-edged sword. On one side, it is a source of innovation, perseverance, and pioneering. On the other side it boasts of pride, arrogance, and unbridled optimism that can lead to severe consequences. The degree of independence that is both accepted and expected in American culture cuts against the grain of the way most cultures exist. Stephanie Coontz highlights the malady of hyperindependence: The Anglo-American notion that dependence on others is immature, weak, shameful, or uniquely feminine is foreign to most cultures. In the worldview of these societies, independence is antisocial; expressing one’s neediness, even codifying it, is the route to social harmony and personal satisfaction for both men and women. The Japanese, for example, have a noun amae, which means reliance on the goodwill or indulgence of another, and a verb amaru, which means essentially to ask for such indulgence. Although increasingly there is a disapproving connotation attached to these words, it is not culturally stigmatized to emphasize one’s dependence on others. Modern American parents teach their children that they can be anything they want to be; in ancient Greece, such overweening confidence in the individual’s ability to shape his or her own fate was the sin of hubris, and it brought the protagonists of many Greek tragedies to bitter ends. In precapitalist societies, economic, social, and political interactions were not separable from personal relations. No individual operated independently of the kin group or the local community. Consequently, definitions of self were always contextual, because the self did not pick and choose relations with others; it emerged out of these relations and remained dependent on them. I ndependence was feared, not cherished.12 Won’t You Be My Neighbor?</p>
<p>Most American children of the 1970s through the 1990s started their day with the PBS television show Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood. The man with the toothy grin and the crummy sweater crooned the joys of his neighborhood and issued an invite to friendship, followed by a half hour of learning and visiting with different characters in his neighborhood. The same children who faithfully viewed Fred Rogers have discovered real neighborhoods to be much more difficult when it comes to developing relationships and daily interaction.</p>
<p>Pastors, church planters, and small group leaders have also discovered how hard it is to develop community from a society that is not experienced in true community. We’ve just not been shaped for it.</p>
<p>If we are willing to take the risks that will push us into uncomfortable places of reaching out to strangers and neighbors we’ve not known closely, we can see great changes take place.</p>
<p>Dan Chiras and Dave Wann have researched and written for years about the joys and ways of sustainable living and development of better neighborhoods. Their encouragement is this, Where neighbors once lived in relative isolation, you can create security, friendships, interdependence, and meaningful social interaction. The cost of living will surely go down, over time, while the quality of your life and the lives of your loved ones soars.13</p>
