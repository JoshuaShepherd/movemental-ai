<h1>Salt Blocks and Salt Shakers</h1>
<h2>The Power of Scattered Saints</h2>
<p>The greatest need for our time is for the Church to become what it has seldom been: the body of Christ with its face to the world, loving others regardless of religion or culture, pouring itself out in a life of service, offering hope to a frightened world, and presenting itself as a real alternative to the existing arrangement.</p>
<p>—Brennan Manning, The Signature of Jesus</p>
<p>One morning I was heading off to my office and glanced across our yard, noticing our horses sniffing the salt block we set out for them. I don't know much about salt blocks, just that my wife said the horses needed one. She said they are used to supplement possible low sodium and chloride levels in a cow or horse diet. The idea is that the animal will have the natural instinct to know when it needs salt and will come to the block when the need kicks in. As I drove away, I thought to myself, "That's pretty much the way we do church." We tend to pack into church buildings (salt blocks) and say to the world around us, "Here we are, come and get it!" Most of us are familiar with the idea that Jesus espoused in the salt of the earth metaphor. Salt has two primary uses: flavoring and preserving. It is the flavoring aspect that Jesus was highlighting. He was saying our very presence in the culture should cause the flavors of life to explode. Jesus was really saying, "Hey, disciples, you are to be the spice of life." Let me tell you why you are here. You're here to be salt seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth. If you lose your saltiness, how will people taste godliness? You’ve lost your usefulness and will end up in the garbage. (Matt.</p>
<p>5:13 Message) The problem is that too often our saltiness gets isolated in churchy activity. It gets boxed up in the event or place we call church, and we have been conditioned to think that the main goal is to get nonchurchgoers to take a lick at our salt block.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say we should not invite others to our Sunday morning gatherings. The issue is that Sunday morning success has become the dominant pursuit in the age of churchgrowth strategy. We have come to believe that the scorecard of success is based on how many people we can pack into the box on a given weekend. And we have believed that our primary duty as Christians is to make sure we are in that box on Sundays.</p>
<p>There was a time as a pastor that I would tell my congregation, “You catch ’em, and I’ll clean ’em. Get your friends to church and I’ll make sure they hear the gospel.” It was as if we were working on making a sale, and the job of the church member was to secure the lead, then turn it over to the church staff and me to close the deal. I taught our members that all Christians had it in them to lead others to Christ, and in my head I believed that. But I must not have been so sure deep in my heart, because with our predominant emphasis on the weekend services there was always an overtone that “full-time” pastors were the pros. We even made continual guarantees to our church members that we would not embarrass them if they would bring their friends to church.</p>
<p>This is the way it is in a lot of churches that operate primarily as salt blocks. Pastors and staff members knock themselves out, week to week, trying to offer the best experience possible for church members to get their non-Christian friends to attend. And I am confident that the overwhelming majority of these leaders have the right motives. We’ve all been trying to promote the gospel in the best ways we’ve known to do so. But I’m also reasonably confident this is not what Jesus had in mind when he talked about our saltiness.</p>
<p>Sherri, my wife, is fantastic in the kitchen and rarely does her cooking need anything but a knife and fork. But she always has a saltshaker set on the table just in case someone wants it. It’s silly to think of her setting a salt block on the counter and telling the family, “If you need more salt, just go over there and take a lick.” We don’t go to the salt. We bring salt to the food. It is meant to be embedded in the meal.</p>
<h2>Think Outside the (Church) Box</h2>
<p>Assembling together as the body of Christ is essential, beyond question. And when we do so, we should do it well. We should offer our best music, sermons, and welcoming atmosphere for guests and family. Many leaders Alan and I have worked with begin with a mindset that missional church means no church buildings. Some of them even demonize the use of and ownership of buildings and property. I certainly agree that a church building can be a heavy financial weight that can hamstring a church’s mission. And in many cases our buildings have become comfort zones and safe houses from the outside world. But there are POSTSCRIPT ways that church buildings and properties can be used missionby Alan Hirsch ally if we will only think beyond ourselves.</p>
<p>The prevailing approach to
The size or type of box is evangelism and Christian mission is not the issue. I’ve seen plenty for churches to develop programs, of house churches and self-tiservices, and events for the purpose tled organic churches that are of attracting unbelievers. There inward focused and have no is nothing inherently wrong with real missional ethos or impact wanting to be attractive, and we whatsoever. Their members are not moving into the host culcertainly wouldn’t want our churches ture, and they have just boxed to be unattractive. The problem is that themselves up in a smaller box we rely on the gathered services to and do church the same way, but do the mission and evangelism—as now with poor sermons, bad well as the discipleship, education, three-chord choruses, and the and worship! To exacerbate the kids shouting throughout the problem, outreach and “in-drag” has service. The issue is not about become the dominant approach to the church model or even the evangelizing our culture. The New building but rather whether or Testament church was definitely not the life of Christ is getting attractive to its communities, but out of the church box and into not from this perspective. Their the culture.</p>
<p>Most Christians perceive attractiveness was in their living... the church service as “the main in what we call “witness.” The love event” and thus the central and presence of Jesus flowed through locus for Christian life and acthem into the various societies and tivity. And they look to the pascommunities they lived in. The secret tor and staff members as being to their success as a transformational primarily responsible for orgamovement is that it wasn’t a secret, nizing and conducting outreach but a life evident to all (1 Peter 2:12; and evangelism. As a result, the Col. 1:27). mission of the church is professionalized, and outsourced to the “clergy,” thus leaving the majority of Christians out of the missional equation. This type of thinking causes the better part of mission to languish because it takes the majority of the players out of the game.</p>
<p>Too often, the largest portions of our time, resources, finances, and manpower go into one basket—weekend services.</p>
<p>When churches focus the majority of time and resources in this way, we unwittingly quarantine the life flow of Jesus (the body of Christ), limiting our ability to reach the world around us. It becomes solely a “come to us” equation. In short, our actions say that what we do inside the building is more important than what we do outside the building. Author Jim Peterson comments on this:</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of our gathering for teaching and worship, but congregating has the absolute priority as the predominant form in our churches. We are less clear that we are to live as a community in full view of and among unbelievers. If these were in balance today, the forms of our church would be different beyond recognition. It is just not a part of our tradition to plan for our being in the world with the same serious commitment, with the same disposition to invest people, time, and money, as it is for us to provide for our congregating.1 Peterson pinpoints the core issue. Jesus said, “Your treasure is the place where your heart is” (see Matt. 6:21). You don’t have to guess at what a person or group truly values.</p>
<p>Simply observe the way they spend their time and money and you have the answer. I once read about an exchange between the legendary golfer Gary Player and the late Richard Nixon while they were playing a foursome. Following a perfect drive from the middle of the fairway, Player’s ball landed precisely on the green, spun backward, and stopped three feet from the cup. Nixon said, “Boy, I wish I could hit like that.” Player scowled and said, “No you don’t. If you wanted to play like that, you would have spent the hours I have practicing. You would have hit balls until the blisters on your palms bled, and then you would have hit some more. You don’t want to play like me. You should just be happy when you happen to hit a good shot.” Player’s point was that people pursue what they truly desire or value.</p>
<p>It is very much in the realm of possibility for our churches to start hitting better shots. Many already are. And Alan and I are cheering for more churches to assume the stance of a “going” church rather than just going to church. Jesus admonished us to go (Matt. 28:19). His model and instructions were never for us to primarily focus on getting people to come to church, the very thing that captivates the imagination of the body of Christ today. Again, please do not hear me as being down on “coming to the church.” I am down on this as the dominant, almost exclusive, feature of church mission.</p>
<p>Being God’s missional people means we put the wheels back on our Christianity. It means that our churches are known more for the presence of God in our people throughout the community than the coolness of our buildings, our billboards, or our polished Sunday morning services. This means that when people hear the name of our church, their initial thought is, “I’m so glad those people are in our community... we’re way better off because of them.” Our churches shouldn’t be first thought of as, “Yes, that’s the church at the corner of First and Main.” Or “That’s the church where so-and-so preaches.” Agreat example of a missional people from a large campus church is the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Boise, I daho.</p>
<p>They have learned to utilize their twenty-two-acre property in several ways that have established them as a kingdom outpost in their community. Several initiatives of this fellowship reach deeply into the heart of Boise. The “Garden O’ Feedin” is an organic garden, started and maintained by church members and community volunteers. This year’s harvest produced over thirty-five tons of fresh, nutritious produce for needy people in the community. The GOF produces enough food to supplement the needs of the church’s food pantry, which is POSTSCRIPT housed in a large warehouse on by Alan Hirsch the church property as well. The food pantry provides for hundreds of people each week and is The prevailing concept of church, an amazing ministry in its own with its associated understanding right.

The Vineyard Boise is a salty church.</p>
<p>Many churches over the last few years have taken advantage of mass mailings, radio ads, and websites to make themselves known in their communities. There is nothing inherently wrong with these ways and means. Several wonderful stories come to my mind about people who ended up at the church I planted and subsequently came to faith in Jesus; and their journey began by hearing a radio ad, or they received a postcard invite through the mail. Many of these methods are well designed and very effective at reaching people who have Christian backgrounds or have reached a place of complete desperation. This may effectively appeal to 30 to 40 percent of the population at best. But what about the rest of the population? How do we reach people who are disinterested or completely turned off by the idea of church-as-we-know-it?</p>
<p>This is why a missionary mentality should be the mindset of all Christians, everywhere.</p>
<h2>The Canary in the Coal Mine</h2>
<p>In The Forgotten Ways Alan talked about our current condition in the West and how several recent studies and books point to a growing interest in spirituality. That is the good news. The not-so-good news is that these same reports indicate a waning interest in, and general feeling of alienation from, the church. Dan Kimball’s They Like Jesus but Not the Church and Gabe Lyons and Dave Kinnaman’s un Christian are recent books that speak to this spiritual climate. How we respond as the people of God should grab our attention.</p>
<p>The most significant forms of church development over the past fifteen to twenty years have been based on what is commonly called the contemporary church-growth model. Alan comments on this: The more successful forms of this model tend to be large, highly professionalized, and overwhelmingly middle-class, and express themselves culturally using contemporary, “seekerfriendly” language and middle-of-the-road music forms. They structure themselves around “family ministry” and therefore offer multigenerational services. Demographically speaking, they tend to cater largely to what might be called the “familyvalues segment”—good, solid, well-educated citizens who don’t abuse their kids, who pay their taxes, and who live, largely, what can be called a suburban lifestyle.2 The type of church Alan describes here is somewhat effective at reaching non-Christians who fall within this demographic profile because there is a cultural fit and connection. These churches do not have to go into another culture or cross over significant barriers for the gospel to come across as meaningful.</p>
<p>But what about people that don’t fit this profile? By all accounts the church in America is in decline and Christianity has not bettered its reputation with non-Christians in spite of over forty years of finely honed church-growth theory and techniques.</p>
<p>Our attempts at harvesting look something like this:</p>

<h2>Potential Harvest Fields</h2>
<p>Churches that devote the majority of their resources and efforts to church-growth methods barely reach into the nonmiddle-class field. Like Nixon, every once in a while they hit a nice shot... mostly by accident.</p>
<h2>Shake It Up, Baby</h2>
<p>Saltshakers have lots of looks and come in various sizes and shapes, but they are all based on a simple concept. They exist to scatter and spread seasoning over a broad surface. To be God’s salty people we don’t have to abandon church, per se, but we must think beyond the boxes and blocks of our church events and buildings. Our imaginations have become captive to the gathering mode, to the detriment of God’s missional purposes in and through our own lives. This is one case where it is good to be scatterbrained. As Christ followers we must never lose our habit of coming and gathering in fellowship (something the writer of Hebrews warns against—Heb. 10:25). I think it’s safe to say we have that discipline down pretty well.</p>
<p>But we must recover something that is sorely missing, a vision of going out in mission—of mission as lifestyle.</p>
<p>Recapturing the ethos and impulse of a missionary means we can’t continue relying primarily on programs, events, and advertising to attract people to come to us. This is tied to what Alan calls missional-incarnational. It’s about relating to people on their own turf without centralizing our expression as the people of God within the walls of a church building.</p>
<p>Gregory Leffel, missiologist and cofounder of the missional community, Communality conveys the idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means, fundamentally, to be for others, to plunge into their
passionate world—individually as mediators for the lost and
collectively as a body locked in loving embrace with the world
by its colors, to sense what it senses, to understand it from

his life to us as a servant.3

and moved into the neighborhood” (John 1:14 Message).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the heart of what it means to be missional-incarnational. It is a “simple to understand but costly to follow” first step. God began initiating redemption first by becoming one of us. Jesus lived among us. He ate, drank, dressed, worked, sweat, took vacations... he did it all. He wove his own life into the fabric of the community and engaged its humanness at the most base levels. And he did it for thirty years before he ever even “went public” with his ministry.</p>
<p>Imagine that. I know from experience with church planters across many denominational and organizational lines that most of them would be cut off from support and funding if they had not produced substantial “fruit” in thirty months, much less thirty years.</p>
<p>One of the things St. Louis, Missouri, is famous for is beer. Breweries, microbreweries, and pubs dot the urban and near-urban landscape. Awhile back, a group from Journey Church sought to reach out to folks that frequent such spots.</p>
<p>They approached the owners of Schlafly Bottleworks, a local brewery and pub, and received permission to begin a forum called Theology At The Bottleworks. The monthly event hosts discussions on topics such as poverty, global warming, race relations... just about anything headlining today’s culture concerns. Their mission is to open the eyes of people to see God at work in the culture and to develop relationships with non-Christians along the way. This ministry has been featured on many national media platforms and has received a lot of criticism from members of its own denomination. They have been vilified for not sharing the “gospel message” and have been heavily criticized for “having church where beer is served.” The critics of this mission have either forgotten or most probably have never learned that Jesus’ ministry was embedded deeply among “bottlePOSTSCRIPT works” type people. And he received criticism and eventually by Alan Hirsch crucifixion for his trouble.</p>

These attitudes sully the name of Christ and patently deny his very character and message as “friend of the outcast and sinner.” It’s a sad reality that the fact that Jesus was labeled as a friend of sinners is lost on so many evangelicals. We should hope to be accused of the same thing.</p>
<p>Jesus wasn’t just courteous to the ones whom the religious community despised the most; he was downright engaging and relational with them. To hang around with tax collectors and prostitutes was as bad as you could get in the eyes of the religious establishment. I don’t think it’s far-fetched to believe that if Jesus were walking our streets today, many Christians would call him a beer-drinking friend of homosexuals and gangbangers.</p>
<p>By telling us to “go into all the world,” Jesus was placing the responsibility upon us, his disciples, to gain proximity to those who are not Christians. It is up to us to move toward them. Jesus didn’t demand relationship on religious terms.</p>
<p>His terms of relationship were the terms of the kingdom of God. And the constant in the kingdom is the pursuit of redemption and reconciliation for people and all of creation.</p>
<h2>A Scattered Mind</h2>
<p>Contrary to what we might think, Jesus shows us that meeting needs is not the starting point for incarnational mission. John Hayes, who has spent over three decades serving and living among the poor in the most downtrodden neighborhoods in places such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and London, says, “When missionaries start with the need, hoping they will one day get to know poor people personally, they are likely to be found 10 years later, still addressing the need.”4 It is one thing to put on sanitary gloves and give handouts to those in need. It is altogether different to rub shoulders and live among them. One of the young missional leaders doing this very thing is Aaron Snow. In the last four years he has led the establishment of missional communities in Fort Worth and Las Vegas. Although he is only twenty-five years old, Aaron and his wife Morgan have recently moved to their third major city (Austin, Texas) where they are establishing another missional community. Read Aaron’s own words on what they have learned about the importance of presence as it plays into incarnational mission:</p>
<p>We began as a group of white, middle-class, suburban church kids that had been exploring what life as a follower of Christ should look like. We started taking regular trips to the streets of Fort Worth and became students of those who had served there for many years, as well as the homeless individuals we sought to serve. It didn’t take long to realize the abundance of tangible resources available to the homeless in that area.</p>
<p>Churches and various non-profit and government organizations were doing a great job of meeting the basic needs of the people on the street. They did not need our Wendy’s dollar menu burgers, or our hand-me-down fashion from the closet.</p>
<p>Not long after we began going into Fort Worth we met Michael Hatcher. He had been serving these people for years and began to mentor and teach us about working among the homeless. He and his family had moved into the neighborhood several years before and Michael was known on the streets as “The Rev.” He walked the streets during the week ministering to these people and helped them get their ID’s, jobs, and bus passes. But most importantly he gave them himself as a friend. We began to follow suit, learning to listen.</p>
<p>Conversations led to prayer, topped with hugs, and a sense of comfort among the homeless; knowing they had made new friends. We came to understand that many of these people had not engaged in genuine conversation with non-homeless people in years.</p>
<p>We were seeing fruit from our labor but something was missing. While we had close relationships with our new friends on the street we could not truly relate to them. We began praying that God would provide a house for communal living among the poor. We were just 15 college-aged kids but we began to make quite the impact on East Lancaster.</p>
<p>We had organized the annual “Art-n-the Park” celebration, birthed the “Unity in the Community Network” of organizations who served among the homeless in Ft. Worth, and had the attention of many in the city but we still felt we had so much to learn.</p>
<p>We found two duplexes on the same property. Two of the four units were for rent, and they were cheap. By this point our organization, Intentional Gatherings, had gained its nonprofit status, and donations were coming in from people who believed in the vision of the “I. G. House.” We moved two guys into one unit and four girls into the other. It was then that we truly began to learn the in’s and out’s of homelessness, and how to attack the problem at the root.</p>
<p>We were in a neighborhood about a mile from the “leper colony,” which was full of the “working poor.” (Those who are not-yet-homeless, but hanging on by a thread.) Our primary focus shifted from the already homeless to the almost homeless. The work among the already homeless continued and the relationships that had been made were fostered. The “I. G. House” crew grew close as they lived in tight-knit Gospel centered community, and sought to make a difference in the neighborhood in which they resided. As the crew grew they eventually took over three of the four units on the property.</p>
<p>From weekend kickball tournaments to front porch afterschool tutoring &#x26; Saturday morning breakfast in the yard our group of missionaries was serving Jesus in a way previously foreign to us all.5</p>
<h2>Sub-Missional</h2>
<p>What if the Lord hasn’t called you to live in a downtrodden urban area? What if you are called by God to live in the suburbs? God is the original missionary, and with half of all Americans living in the suburbs, you can be sure he has sent his people into the suburbs as salt and light. If you live in the suburbs, God didn’t park you there to live the “American Dream.” Rather, he sent you there to be a sign and foretaste of the kingdom of God. Many times mission remains on the shelf because of our perception that if we can’t do something huge and spectacular, then our role is just to faithfully attend church, pay our tithes, and listen to Christian radio. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In the mid-90s our family moved into a suburban home in a subdivision that was about eight or nine years old. We were the proverbial new kids on the block, and not only were we hoping to develop friendships with our neighbors, we also wanted to be salt and light. I have POSTSCRIPT had enough airplane conversations with strangers to know by Alan Hirsch that, “Hi, my name is Lance, I’m a pastor,” is not the way to The gospel and the conversion get a relationship started with process always travels along most people.

Night Football at our house. The flyer said that I would provide snacks and for each guy to bring his own beverage of choice. I had never done anything like this before and had no clue as to what the results would be.</p>
<p>It seemed a little weird, but I thought, “Just go for it!” To my surprise a half dozen guys showed up. The next week they showed up again. Over that first season we became friends and continued our Monday night group over the next six years I lived in the neighborhood. Out of the six guys, one guy who had grown up in church but had not been back since he started college began to come to our church. Another one of the guys ended up coming to faith in Christ. I had shared the faith with Jeff on more than one occasion, but I wasn’t the one to “lead” him to the Lord in the traditional sense, and Jeff and his family didn’t start coming to my church.</p>
<p>They joined a church they had been invited to by the friend who had prayed with him when he made a decision to give his life to the Lord.</p>
<p>Shortly after this decision, Jeff excitedly told me about his new life and shared with me that our family had spoken volumes to him by the way we lived. He brought up the time we had collected funds to repair the air-conditioning system of the single mom of four kids who lived on our street, the way our family helped his family out when his wife had a baby, and the fact that I had always treated him as a friend though he was far from Christ. He said this had impacted him greatly and sowed seeds and watered them prior to him deciding to follow Christ.</p>
<h2>Planting and Watering</h2>
<p>In a scene from Seinfeld, George and his girlfriend are at the diner as he pays for a “Big Salad” to take to Elaine who is to meet them at Jerry’s apartment. George’s girlfriend happens to hand the salad to Elaine as they walk into the apartment and Elaine thanks her for it. George begins to seethe inside and eventually erupts in anger at his girlfriend for not giving him credit for buying the Big Salad.</p>
<p>This story reminds me of the way many of us have conceptualized what it means to deliver the gospel. The apostle Paul taught that the most important part of the harvest is not just the final step of plucking the ripened fruit... or delivering the Big Salad. Sometimes we plant the gospel seed and sometimes we water it. At other times we may be present at the moment someone says “I now believe in Jesus” for the first time. But it is all part of the process, and each role is every bit as important as the other.</p>
<p>For several years I have watched my friend Ken Smith express his life with the heart and mind of a missionary. He is not particularly articulate, sometimes dresses like Larry the Cable Guy, and you would never get him behind a pulpit.</p>
<p>But it would be impossible for me to tell all the stories of the people whom Ken has impacted as he goes about his “normal” life. He runs a handyman service and once told me that his approach to each job is that he is there as a missionary, and if the repair job gets done, then that is just extra.</p>
<p>Ken has a habit of giving strangers rides when he sees a car broken down or someone walking along the highway. One day I asked him about this and if he was not a little afraid that he might be picking up Jason, or Freddy Krueger. He said, “I try to be careful and I won’t pick someone up that is carrying an axe or a chainsaw.” Then he gave a more serious answer: I’m not the kind of guy that is going to teach a Bible study and I’m not what you would call an evangelist, although I have prayed with people to receive Christ. I’m more of a seed and water guy. I just try to think what I would want someone to do for me if I were in that situation. Just the other day I saw a young man walking in the direction of the local high school and I offered him a ride. On the way I asked him how he was doing and he said, “Okay... I guess.” I asked him what he meant by that and he began to tell me about problems his parents were having and how things at home were not too good. When we pulled up to the school, I asked him if I could pray for him. He said, “Yeah, sure,” and I prayed for him right there.</p>
<p>After learning about yet another person that Ken and his wife Candi had opened their home to, I asked Ken what thought process he and Candi have when considering opening their home up for others. Without hesitation he said, “Look, everything I have belongs to God. If I hear about someone that needs a place to stay and I have an extra bedroom, there’s not much to pray about. I have a spare car that I have loaned out several times when someone needed one. I’m just responding to the grace God has poured out on my life. I’m not trying to earn my salvation. I’m just living it out.”</p>

<p>I believe so deeply in the power of God’s good news people that I have committed my life to somehow awakening this now sleeping giant. If we, the people of God, can “find ourselves” again, right here, right now, in this time and place, then the most profound of revolutions is on! And right now, we have a good chance of it, but for Western Christianity at least, it might well be our last chance to get it right—witness the now almost complete demise of biblical Christianity in Western Europe!</p>
<p>I will go further and say that the battle for the future of Christianity in the West will be worked out in America—and I say this as a non-American, an Aussie with South African roots and a deep Jewish heritage. If we fail right here, right now, in America, then I really fear the eventual passing of a vibrant biblical Christianity in Western contexts. And so, I have left kith and kin and come to America to help awaken the sleeping giant of God’s people. I am, at core, an activist and not a theoretician! I am a stakeholder who has played all his cards on this time and this place, on the belief that it is a strategic time, a time when our choices are really going to matter.</p>
<p>To awaken the people of God to their dormant potentials, we have to shake off certain ways of imagining ourselves that hinder and therefore bind us from being the people we were designed to be. Truth is, we have all drunk so deeply from institutional wells of thinking about Christianity that it is hard to think of ourselves differently. We have, to co-opt Marx’s words, taken a big dose of what he called “the opiate of the people”—religion (in the really bad sense of the word). Marx saw religion as the cultural force that kept people docile and submissive to the prevailing order of reality, and to be honest, in this at least, I think he was right. Use your imaginations here: morphine or heroin is an opiate (opium-based drug).</p>
<p>Ever seen a person taking a hit of heroin? I have, and they effectively go into a deep, trancelike sleep. Religion does that to us... it dulls us and puts us to sleep. We become ineffective.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Way of Jesus was never the way of “religion.” In fact, Jesus reserves his harshest possible condemnations for the very “religious” people of his day and condemned religion for what it does to people—just read Matthew 23 for a taster. Far from being a toxic hit of heroin, Jesus was a sobering splash of bracing, icy water! He awoke people to God, kingdom, their own potentials, and he started a movement that swept out from backwater Judea to utterly transform the world of its day. Everyone who was touched and transformed by Jesus was able to, in turn, participate in the transformation of others around about them. The Jesus movement that emerged from the dusty boondocks of the Roman Empire has swelled through history to transform billions of lives, and it still does, as millions are added every year.</p>
<p>This is the power of people movement, and this is the church that Jesus designed to change the world—a thoroughgoing people movement that had little of what we normally conceive of as what constitutes a “church”—buildings, clergy, bookstores, seeker-sensitive services, priest-run liturgies, complex theological formulas, or whatever. In fact, this very question provided the initiating impulse of my book The Forgotten Ways, which was to answer how they did this. My attempt at an answer to this question has guided the writing of Right Here, Right Now. It constitutes some of that reframing that is needed to reinvent ourselves in our time.</p>
<p>But my role is not quite finished. I started with the briefing—an attempt to give some positive framework of how the everyday Christian might engage in Jesus’ mission more effectively (I don’t even use the terms “clergy/laity” because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that lies at the root of many of our problems). And
then my slightly zany buddy Lance offered his somewhat folksy
all-American twist to what it means to activate your own
erences that connect with the story of most of our intended
debriefing. There are some things that just need to be said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this chapter will involve naming some of the things that I believe must be dealt with if we are going to do the particular tasks God has for us to do at the dawn of the twenty-first century (Eph. 2:10). These are some of the proverbial elephants in the room: the big issues we must face but most people simply dodge because they are considered too hard to deal with.</p>
<p>To chase the elephants from the room, I am going to have to use a stick at the very least. So here you have Hirschy with a stick in his hand. Not me at my nicest, but to heal a system that you deeply love, you sometimes have got to get over being “nice.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s Nothing Like a Good Stretch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you will have noticed by now, this book stretches the meaning of what we normally mean by “church.” We make no apology for this: there is no doubt that over time, our idea of the church has shrunk to unbiblical proportions—so we need some stretching, as ridiculous as that sounds. Our best thinkers have long recognized that the gospel has been effectively marginalized and Christianity relegated to the realm of private, individualized, religious opinion with little impact on the broader world of politics, science, economics, art, and culture.1 If ever there was a time to reimagine the church and its mission, it is now.</p>
<p>We certainly need to think of the church more as an exponential people movement involving all of God’s people and not an institution run by religious professionals offering different brands of religious goods and services. But to stretch our ecclesiology will require that we have to somehow get a handle on the basics of what makes a church, well... a church. This is because in reinventing the church for the particular challenges of our era we run the risk of ending up being less of what the Bible means by “church” than before.</p>
<p>So we must go back to Scripture to rediscover what theologians have called the “marks” or “identifiers” of the church that Jesus built and start again from there.</p>
<p>In saying this, I am not suggesting it’s all bad. But I do think that the traditional marks of the church that stemmed from the Reformation are woefully inadequate to equip the contemporary Western church to deal with the bewildering missionary challenge we face. The traditional marks all orbit around the practice of the sacraments. The Reformers argued about whether it was two, three, or seven (the Catholics), but they all agreed that the church is the place where the sacraments are administered and experienced. The problem with all these formulations, however, is that they effectively “institutionalize” grace by making it something that only the priests can handle, usually in “churchly” contexts. Gone is the idea of people movement that so characterized the early church.</p>
<p>Gone is the idea of a Philip simply baptizing the eunuch, gone are the actual meals in houses that made communion a daily affair. Not to mention that they say nothing about mission, discipleship, and cultural life beyond the confines of the church institution itself. What is clearly inadequate can therefore prove to be culturally oppressive to the so-called laity—those believers who have to exercise their following of Jesus outside of the confines of the church’s organizational life. It’s time for a stretch, don’t you think?</p>
<p>In The Forgotten Ways I tell the story of how my own community had to get back to basics to assess if, and how, we were being an authentic and faithful expression of Jesus’ church. The outcomes of that enquiry I believe still stack up well in providing us with some working essentials for a New Testament ecclesiology (doctrine of the church).2 So this is what I believe is a useful (but not the only) way of identifying a faithful expression of church.</p>
<p>A church is...</p>
<ul>
<li>Centered on Jesus: He is the new covenant with God and</li>
</ul>
<p>he thus forms the true epicentre of an authentic Christian faith. An ecclesia is not just a God-community— there are many such religious communities around. We are defined by our relationship to the Second Person of the Trinity, the Mediator, Jesus Christ. We believe in Trinity to be sure, but take Jesus out and it simply isn’t a church anymore. A community centered on Jesus as Lord participates in the salvation that he brings. We receive the grace of God in him.</p>
<ul>
<li>A covenanted community: A church is a formed people,</li>
</ul>
<p>and not by people just hanging out together, but ones bound together in a distinctive bond. There is a certain obligation toward one another formed around a covenant. So here a covenant community is a network of relationships formed around Jesus our Lord. Remember this does not imply buildings per se.</p>
<p>But, more is required to truly constitute a church. Let me suggest that a true encounter with God in Jesus must result in...</p>
<ul>
<li>Worship: defined as offering our lives back to God</li>
</ul>
<p>through Jesus. Note that this is an all-of-life, biblically stretched definition. It includes communal praise and learning, but extends to every aspect of a life and a world offered back to God in worship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discipleship: defined as following Jesus and becoming</li>
</ul>
<p>increasingly like him (Christlikeness). Again, this is not just “church” as we tend to define it. It’s the relational fabric of the church that reaches way beyond organizational boundaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission: defined as extending the mission (the redemptive purposes) of God through the activities of his people in every sphere and domain of life, including, of course, church planting but not confined to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there are five identifiers, or marks, in the above model.</p>
<p>Graphically it might look something like this: worship ant Commu ven nit Co y mission discipleship We can easily see that these are profoundly interlinked and inform each other to create a complex phenomenon that constitutes the basics of church as Jesus intended. They describe the core (minimal?) aspects of a faithful ecclesia. If some are really missing, or are significantly diminished, we should be asking some serious questions about ourselves.</p>
<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>
<p>Another absolutely central issue we face in a world that is largely turning away from Christianity is that we have to reestablish credibility. That people all across America (and the Western world for that matter) think that Christ-ians are fundamentally unlike Christ is a serious problem! And research is clear on this trend;3 as we have seen, most people in the various neighborhoods and contexts we inhabit are actually very open to God, Jesus, and spirituality and are willing to engage in meaningful dialogue around these topics. What they manifestly are not open to is “the church.” That means the basics of our message are intact; but the medium of the message, the messengers so to speak, are excluded from the equation. And while “the church” is always an easy target and often gets unjustly bad press, this should give us pause to think seriously about what we are currently doing that gives the impression it seems to be giving.</p>
<p>Credibility is a major source of currency for any organization, but especially for the church that Jesus built, and its loss will almost definitely result in a proportionate loss of missional influence on those around about us. Let’s face it, if we are not fundamentally different from anyone else (and statistics indicate that this is the case in almost every sphere of morality: money, sex, and power), then why would anyone want to take on the “yoke” of the kingdom of God? If the gospel with all its demands of living under a Lord doesn’t seem to have any transformative effect on its messengers, why believe the Message?</p>
<p>Without deemphasizing the contribution of the great missionaries like Paul, seminal sociologist of religion Rodney Stark in his various books maintains that the greatest factor in the growth of early Christianity was the example of ordinary Christians living out their faith in their communities.4 In fact, he documents the fact that Christianity grew substantially at the time of the terrible plagues that swept the Roman Empire in the first few centuries; there were massive spikes in the growth of the church around these times.</p>
<p>The reason for these growth spurts, he suggests, was because while all the pagans abandoned their sick and ran to the hills, the Christians stayed behind to care for the sick and many of them died in this sacrificial service. But many of the sick survived to tell the tale, and tell it they did. The sheer mercy and goodness of the ordinary, marginalized Christians stunned the pagan peoples of that time because such Christlike compassion and service was unknown to them. It was the sheer goodness of the Christian church that established the moral credibility of its message and laid the grounds for the spiritual transformation of the Roman Empire. The early church did not seem to have the credibility gap that we so struggle with. The medium was the message! Jesus was alive and real in, and to, the people.</p>
<p>As far as I can discern, the only way for Christians to overcome our credibility gap, after centuries of Christianity, is by reactivating an authentic discipleship. Why? Because at its core, discipleship is becoming more like Jesus, or as I tag it in The Forgotten Ways, “becoming a little Jesus.” God knows, the world certainly doesn’t need more “religion”; but it can certainly do with a whole lot more Jesus-like people around the place. One of the key roles of Jesus in the life and imagination of believers is to provide a model for our own humanity. Jesus as Man is the prototypal humanity as God defines it. Ask yourself the question, how bad will I be if I became more and more like Jesus, the most perfect human who ever lived? And this is why getting back to the basics of discipleship is so essential to the mission of the church—it’s about establishing Christ’s presence everywhere through our lives as his people right here, right now, through the very medium of a life well lived. If we miss this... well, then surely it doesn’t really matter what we do elsewhere. In fact, as stated in Untamed and re Jesus, if we just simply get more “religious” and moralistic, then we are likely to do more damage than good.5</p>
<h2>All-Consuming Fires</h2>
<p>The overwhelming economic and social environment in which we are raised in the West profoundly impacts us all. We are all born into a culture that gets to shape us—in fact, disciple us—from the time of birth to death. The truth is that Western culture at the dawn of the twenty-first century is a particularly potent culture because of the omnipresent pervasiveness of media and the predominant role of market forces (with associated money and consumption) in our lives. We have to simply assume that the prevalent values and perspectives of the culture are being downloaded into each one of us from an early age; some of them are clearly good, some of them not so much.</p>
<p>The problem with these cultural ideas is that we generally can’t “see” them. Culture is invisible to those immersed in it; it’s like asking the proverbial fish to define water. We assume its rightness until we are confronted with an alternative vision of reality that calls it into question. It takes a fair bit of self-reflection, and I would say a very proactive, untamed discipleship in the Way of Jesus, to discern the darker sides of the culture. This is why the kingdom of God can only be experienced as a conversion from one system (kingdom) into another (e. g., Col.1:13; 1 Thess. 1:9).</p>
<p>The point of this unnerving piece of information is that we simply have to be more aware of our own largely middle-class, and profoundly consumerist, biases if we are going to be effective missional agents in our time. Once again, it’s not that being middle-class is wrong per se; it’s just that it has some values that are consistent with the kingdom of God, but make no mistake, it has others that work to undermine Jesus’ mission and purpose in the world.6 Obsession with personal security or the desire for increasing amounts of money and power are problematic when dealing with Lord Jesus. Even something as seemingly right as “getting an education” can become an idol that is designed to secure ourselves and resist God’s will for our lives—and let me be clear here, I am not saying that education is wrong, far from it, but just like all things, it can become a means of disobedience and rebellion. Education is real social power and capital, and the fact is, we middle-class folk use it all the time; it’s unlikely to be spiritually neutral.</p>
<p>Likewise with consumerism; to buy things is basic to survival in a market-based economy like ours, but to be defined by what we buy is another thing altogether. The truth is that marketing exploits our deepest fears and desires in order to sell products. They have to. The factories and the economy produce much, much more than we need, so in order to keep the system operative, to make the capital work on its own terms, we have to keep the fires of consumption burning. To do this, marketing has to create desire and then seek to fulfill it through the purchasing of products. I am not being snide, cynical, or anticapitalist here, so please don’t dismiss what is being said for reasons of defensiveness. This is patently the case; consider how much of what you buy today will still be used by you in six months’ time. Research says that only 5 to 10 percent will still be in use in six months; the rest is either thrown out into the garbage or becomes someone else’s product—mostly thrown out.7 Track what happens to the Christmas toys you buy for the kids, or last season’s fashions, to make the point.</p>
<p>Heck, we all go into debt to buy things we don’t really need.</p>
<p>Ever asked why? What’s really driving us? Well, the aim is to create need in order to keep the factories, and therefore the economy, firing. But this takes a significantly spiritual twist in our own day—because in a more and more competitive environment, marketers have to reach deeper and deeper into human motivation to be able to sell us things we don’t really need. There is no doubt that when we go shopping, something akin to spirituality is at work. We buy not just to live and survive but also to fulfill a search for meaning, identity, purpose, and belonging. And here is where consumerism clashes with the claims of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And why is all this important? Well, apart from the serious implications for discipleship, global justice, and the environment, because it’s our culture, and as we saw in the briefing, sometimes in order to be faithful agents of the King, we simply have to subvert it. Also, we need to demonstrate, witness to, a more righteous way of life. The fact is that all the consumption and the relative wealth of people in the West has not made us happy at all. Depression and suicide are largely problems in Western cultural contexts. The children in America are more likely to kill themselves than those in a Brazilian slum! This has to say something to us. It’s a big elephant in the room and it has to be confronted if we are going to be missional Christians right here, right now.</p>

<p>Kingdom City Limits?</p>
<p>Here’s a biggie, and one most believers seldom, if ever, stop to think about even in a lifetime. It goes something like this: we tend to so completely identify the church with the kingdom of God that we end up with what we might call ecclesiocrasy (rule by the church). And if this sounds like a rather absurd notion (that the clergy once ruled the world), be assured that it has dominated European understandings of the church for a long, long time. In fact, this dangerous error of category lies at the root of false ideas of the church. For instance, when the Roman Catholic Church talks about the pope as Christ’s vicar, they mean that he is Jesus’ sole, authoritative representative, and that Christ rules his world through the medium of the church, of which the pope is the unquestioned boss! I kid you not. As far as I am aware, this basic understanding of the doctrine of the church is still held by the Catholic Church.8 But we all continue to get the distinction between kingdom and church very wrong, and with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Let me suggest that the basic mistake here is to make a complete correlation of the church—the redeemed community of Jesus’ people—with God’s kingdom—his active government or rule in the world.</p>
<p>Is the kingdom of God simply to be equated with the church? I sincerely hope not. As much as I love the church and believe that it is a nonnegotiable part of God’s plan, it is to King Jesus and not any human agency that I must give my ultimate allegiance. The church is not simply the same as the kingdom. The church is an expression of the kingdom, perhaps even the most consistent expression of it, but the kingdom (God’s active rule in and over his universe) is much larger than the church—in fact, it is cosmic in scope.</p>
<p>Reggie Mc Neal wisely suggests that we need a kingdomshaped view of the church, not a church-shaped view of the kingdom. In other words, as God’s people we must always assess ourselves in the light of God’s active rule in the world and not the other way around. Theologian Richard Neuhaus is right when he says, Our restless discontent should not be over the distance between ourselves and the first century Church but over the distance between ourselves and the Kingdom of God to which the Church then and now is the witness.9 Why all this church-kingdom stuff? Well, because if we are to be effective agents of God’s kingdom in this world, we need to be freed to see his kingdom express itself everywhere and anyplace—as indeed it does. God turns up in places where we might least expect to see him, but we need the eyes to see what he is doing if we are going to join him in the redemption of the world. Acomplete association of the kingdom with the church locks up God’s activity and links it exclusively to organized church activities like Sunday school, communal worship services, and the like. And as wonderful and necessary as these are to Christian community, the diminished view of the kingdom that results from this will never get us beyond the four walls of the church so that we might fulfill our mission of discipling the nations.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God can’t be institutionalized in this way.</p>
<p>To the contrary, it challenges all these idolatrous attempts to control it—be it churchly and otherwise! Besides, it’s not about simply getting more church-based services up to scratch; it is going to take the whole body of Christ as a fluid, dynamic, witnessing agency, active in every possible arena of life, to bring the gospel of God’s love into his world. This, in fact, goes to the heart of our mission in the world.</p>

<p>Traditional Boundaries</p>
<h2>Attractional-Extractional</h2>
<p>Another elephant in the room is the whole issue of what has come to be called the attractional versus missional church debate. As someone responsible for helping introduce the term into common parlance, let me try to explain it. When we use the term attractional, it is an attempt to describe how we conceive of our church in relation to our culture. In other words, it describes our missionary stance or the expectations we have about the role that church plays in our contexts.</p>
<p>To grasp the importance of this, consider the idea of cultural distance.10 This is a conceptual tool that we can use to discern just how far a person or a people group is from a meaningful engagement with the gospel. In order to determine this, we have to see it on a scale that goes something like this: m0 m1 m2 m3 m4</p>
<p>Each numeral with the prefix m indicates one significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of the gospel. An obvious example of such a barrier would be language. All would agree that if you have to reach across a language barrier, you have got a problem and it’s going to take some time to communicate meaningfully. But others could be race, history, religion/worldview, culture, etc. The more boundaries one has to cross, the harder meaningful communication will be. So for instance, in I slamic contexts, the gospel has struggled to make any significant inroads because religion, race, and a whole lot of history make a meaningful engagement with the gospel very difficult indeed. But this is not limited to overseas missions; it is directly related to missionality right here, right now.</p>
<p>Let me bring it closer to home by applying it to the various spheres in which we have to live. If you see yourself (or your church for that matter) standing on the m0 point above, this is how we might interpret our own context(s): m0–m1 Those with some concept of Christianity who speak the same language, have similar interests, probably the same nationality, and are from a similar class grouping as you or your church.</p>
<p>Most of your friends would probably fit into this bracket. m1–m2 Here we go to the average non-Christian in our context: a person who has little real awareness of, or interest in, Christianity but is suspicious about the church (they have heard bad things). These people might be politically correct, socially aware, and open to spirituality. This category might also include those previously offended by a bad experience of church or Christians—some call them “bruised fruit” and they are hard to reach. Just go to the average local pub/bar or nightclub to encounter these people. m2–m3 People in this group probably have no idea about Christianity. Or they might be part of some ethnic group with different religious impulses or some fringy subculture. This category might also include people marginalized by conservative Christianity—e. g., the gay community. But m2–m3ers are also likely to describe people actively antagonistic toward Christianity as they understand it.</p>
<p>e. g., the new atheists. m3–m4 This group might be inhabited by ethnic and religious groupings with a bad history of the church—e. g., Muslims or Jews. The fact that they are in the West might ameliorate some of the distance, but just about everything else gets in the way of a meaningful dialogue. They are highly resistant to the gospel. Or they are people of completely different language, experience, and worldview. Some immigrant/refugee communities might fit here.</p>
<p>We are all deeply scripted to believe that we must bring people to our church, and so we seldom take into account the cultural dynamics inherent in that equation. But it’s all about culture. Our church has a distinct culture, as do the people we are hoping to reach! In fact, as we saw in the briefing, I believe we have come to a situation where all mission in Western settings now should be considered a cross-cultural enterprise.</p>
<p>And remember the obstinate little truth that it is we who are the “sent” people of God, and whatever that means to our identity as God’s people, it must also sometimes mean we must go to where the people are. If we fail to “go” to the people, then to encounter the gospel meaningfully they must “come.” This is the inbuilt assumption of the attractional church; and it requires that the nonbeliever do all the crosscultural work to find Jesus, and not us! Make no mistake: for many people, coming to church involves some serious crosscultural work for them. They have to be the missionaries!</p>
<p>Another very important fact must be remembered here. We know from now old research that within three to five years of a person becoming a Christian, they will have no meaningful relationships with anyone outside the church. So, assuming that we bring them to our church, and we happen to do a good job at it and effectively socialize them into our church community, we are in effect snapping the natural, organic connections that they have with the host community they come from. This is very problematic because we know that the gospel travels along relational lines. Sever the relationships and we effectively stop the outward movement of the gospel into the broader culture. In other words, attractional evangelism in missionary contexts results in extracting them from their previous relationships and cultural context. This is a big no-no if we are serious about initiating movements right here, right now.</p>
<p>And this is not to say that churches should not gather. Of course we should—churches are worshiping communities.</p>
<p>Nor is it saying we should not be thoroughly attractive when we do. We should be as culturally spicy as we possibly can be. It simply means that when engaging people in m1–m4 distance from us, we should gather incarnationally within a host culture/community and not necessarily extract people from their cultural tribe(s) into our church tribe.</p>
<p>Attractional forms of church in missionary contexts eventually are self-defeating because the church quickly exhausts its supply of relationships and because the new converts quickly become a cultural clique or religious ghetto increasingly marginalized from the original culture.</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>Over many years of being involved in missional expressions of church, I perceive one of the biggest issues facing the movement as a whole is that of sustainability. Tragically, many wonderful, spunky people start out with all the right ideas only to end up exhausted and marginalized because they have simply become, well... unsustainable.</p>
<p>Part of the issue many disciples face is that of lifestyle and the cultural expectations associated with life in the suburbs— no small matter and one that should be reflected on under the rubric of discipleship. For most believers, the idea of missional discipleship seems like a far-off dream because they work most of the time, come home exhausted, spend what little spare time they have with family and kids, and don’t seem to have any time for anything else. Now I don’t mean to diminish the sacredness of work and family, but if work is too demanding for us to involve ourselves in being authentic disciples in realms other than work, it is the dominance of our work that should be questioned and not the viability of our discipleship. Work like this is more of an enslaving thing than it is a means of living. We can all live with a lot less.</p>
<p>Work four days a week instead of five, if only to find more space for God in your life, let alone serve others. Much real life, relationships, and spiritual meaning can be added by simplifying our lives in order to engage more fully in Life.</p>
<p>Another aspect of unsustainability is the loner mentality that goes along with American individualism. Clearly there are times when one cannot avoid being something of a lone ranger, but we have to learn to see this as the exception that only proves the rule. Jesus always intended that we should seek to engage in mission two by two at the very least (Luke 10).</p>
<p>Not all of us will be involved in establishing new communities of faith (what I called in the briefing, apostolic mission), but all of us ought to be involved in community life in one way or another. And mission in the Way of Jesus should always aim at developing communities of Jesus followers—isn’t that what Jesus did? Paul? Other heroes of faith?</p>
<p>In terms of sustainable multiplication church planting associated with people movements, I have always felt that a group of about 30 to 120 has a much greater chance of survival than the smaller cell-group size. Mike Breen, a deeply apostolic friend of mine, rightly notes that this is because what he calls “midsize communities” have their own inbuilt ecology of survival, especially when each person in the group really looks after the other and is mutually involved in worship, play, economics, and life together. He says we are “hardwired for extended family.” We simply don’t flourish in the smaller, more nuclear, versions of family, and we are depersonalized in the much larger “tribal” gatherings.11 Not too big to be unwieldy and mechanical, not too small to seem closed and distressed—that is the trick. But the genius of this lies in the fact that it is church that nonprofessionals can handle and therefore anyone can do. And it’s the basis of sustainability.</p>
<p>But a movement that can change the world has to be larger than a local midsized community. I believe strongly in the power of networks and networking.12 Networks are the fabric of movements and are formed by relationships and mutuality beyond the local expression of church or mission. Through a network, we become a working part of the whole of what God is doing in a city—part of something bigger. It’s being part of a movement. These networks should be sought after and developed. Depending on where one is starting, as a brandnew pioneering project or an essential, innovative part of an existing church, it is important to seek connection to likeminded established churches, organizations, and networks.</p>
<p>The trick is to find a balance of interdependence and not to be dominated by the agenda of some centralist organization.</p>
<p>Networks exist on synergistic, win-win relationships throughout the system. Therefore identify and associate with those who understand and practice this.</p>
<p>The other key area of sustainability is the area of finances.</p>
<p>Many of the readers of this book will not be church-based professionals and are already involved in “regular jobs” whatever that might mean. Much is to be gained by looking at the idea of business as mission (BAM). BAM approaches don’t accept the dualism that separates the secular from the sacred and sees that all of life can, and indeed must, be made sacred by engaging it in Jesus’ name... including business.</p>
<p>The businesses most likely to engage people personally are obviously the best ways to engage missionally (cafés, Laundromats, coaching, HR, etc.), but even less people-oriented businesses (e. g., engineering firms) have employees who are not disciples of Jesus. These businesses provide a wonderful opportunity for God’s kingdom to express itself through his people. In the hands of a missional Christian, the business can become a wonderful tool in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In terms of forms of support, in The Shaping of Things to Come we suggest that financial support could also come in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal support/sponsors: imagine for instance forty</li>
</ul>
<p>people giving $1/day to your support—most of us can get that form of support together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Working part-time: great way of modeling what we are</li>
</ul>
<p>asking others to do whilst engaging non-Christians and keeping our nonchurch skills up.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the established church: if what you are doing can</li>
</ul>
<p>be envisioned as part of the broader mission of the local church, then it is not too much to ask for (and expect) a budget allocation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social entrepreneurialism and BAM as described</li>
</ul>
<p>above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixture of all of the above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting over Risk Aversion</h2>
<p>By and large the church as we know it tends to embody a culture of social restraint and risk aversion. We do not tend to think of “church” as a place where we are likely to experience life-defying adventure... or any at all for that matter.</p>
<p>Now clearly there is a role for creating a safe environment to raise children and to worship, but when our need for safety overwhelms our vision of a better world, and stifles our sense of obligation to this mission, then there is a need for a serious rethink. The church that Jesus built should be a place of learning and adventurous discipleship. And these by definition must involve to some degree the willingness to experiment, to take risks with people, to venture out into the world in order to change it.</p>
<p>The truth is, mission is risky. It involves putting ourselves out of our comfort zones and dealing with people we ordinarily might not engage with. And far from being bad for us, taking risks is actually good for the soul, necessary to a healthy learning process, and vital for innovation in all social contexts. Risk aversion, when it becomes part of the culture of church, will result in a stifling status quo that will resist anything, including God, which comes along to disturb it.</p>
<p>We do well to consider that Jesus is always “dangerous” to our all-too-human penchant for safety and security. He is a Lord, how else could it be otherwise?</p>

<p>This chapter is filled with both a sense of urgency and a sense of desperation. Urgency, because it’s hard to dodge the fact that the twenty-first century presents a major challenge to Christianity as we currently know it. Think about any science fiction movie of significance. Is there any mention at all in them of even the possibility of Christian faith? I certainly cannot recall any. And remember, science fiction, as a literary genre, is about human imagination exploring the possibilities of the future... whether they be nightmarish or utopian. The fact that the church is missing from the genre means that it plays no significant role in the imagination of what the future holds. It’s seen as irrelevant to the great issues of our day— people are not looking in our direction to lead them into the future... and yet who better to do that very thing?</p>
<p>Henri Nouwen underscored the perception of those outside the church as he told the story of serving as a chaplain of a cruise ship that was navigating a dangerous fog. “The captain, carefully listening to a radar station operator who was explaining his position between other ships, walked nervously up and down the bridge and shouted his orders to the steersman.” When he suddenly stumbled over Nouwen, he blurted out what a lot of people think about the church and its ministry: “God damn it, Father, get out of my way.” When it came down to navigating the ship out of danger, Nouwen felt totally useless and unwanted—it seemed that chaplains are only called in to life out of a sense of an obligatory tip of the hat to religion.14 The reality is, we have been pushed from the places where it really matters. Even if we can project ourselves onto the end of the twenty-first century, what will we see there in terms of viable Christian faith? To be honest, I find it very hard to see the privatized, institution-based religion that we experience now surviving into any of these futures—at least as a significant social force for good. That is, unless we adapt. It’s all there in the “unless”—the possibility of repentance and change.</p>
<p>I believe with every inch of my soul that the church that Jesus built, when it is authentic and true, is by far and away the most powerful force for the transformation of the world.</p>
<p>The gospel will always be the good news of God that always addresses the human situation. But the church as we know it is going to have to become more aligned with it, more relevant in all spheres of life, more missional right here, right now, if it is going to effectively deliver its Message to the end of this, what will prove to be an extremely challenging, century.</p>
<p>The desperation I feel stems from knowing that we have a great opportunity right here, right now to recalibrate ourselves for what is coming. In fact, I believe that this recalibration, this rebooting, is well under way. We can, and I believe will, become a people movement again. But only if we can awaken both sides of the movement equation as discussed in the briefing. We need the apostolic mission to engage in exponential church planting, creating communities of faith wherever and whenever we can—many of them, and much more diverse than what we now experience. But the other side is also vitally important. We need to awaken the sheer missional moxie of God’s people as a whole. And we all need to recognize and live out the reality that we are all commissioned (dare I say, ordained) agents of the King, and we live out that agency in every sphere and domain of society.</p>
<p>Everyone gets to play! If we fail to awaken the sleeping giant of the body of Christ, then I believe our opportunity will be lost and the church will continue to decline, and eventually become a mere cultural footnote to Western history.</p>
<p>Much depends on our choices and actions now. I dream that some brothers and sisters, standing at the dawn of the next century, will look back to our time and say that the course of history was changed because many of us broke from the herd and under God rediscovered our courage, along with the missional potentials that lie dormant in God’s people.</p>
<p>All of us dream, but not equally.</p>
<p>Those who dream by night, in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity.</p>
<p>But the dreamers of the day are dangerous folk, for they may act their dreams with open eyes to make it possible.</p>
