<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>—J. W. Sire And so we have come to the end of our book. When a book is written, the author, or authors in this case, do actually have some sort of idea of what they want to say, and they do follow a plan. But a book, fiction or nonfiction, does tend to take on a life of its own. Call this the work of the Spirit or simply whim, this book evolved from being a book designed to elaborate on the idea of communitas and missional church, to becoming a book that is more akin to a theology of adventure and an apologetic for risk.</p>
<p>Without claiming too much in this, we do believe that this shift in emphasis has been a work of the Spirit through our all-too-human lives. Why we think this is the case is because adventure—our capacity to engage fully in the open-ended journey that is the church of Jesus Christ—is the atmosphere out of which much ideas of missionality are formed. As a category of existence, it is actually prior to any discussion about missional church models and practices, because God is a God of adventure, and a life well lived, a life of discipleship, must be one that can take risks as we courageously follow our Lord. This is what we call the faith of leap.</p>
<p>Conversely, our failure to engage the adventure of the spirit/Spirit that is the gospel, and our subsequent risk aversion, have deeply damaged the nature of our witness as well as our experience of authentic ecclesia—the church that Jesus built.</p>
<p>Our adventure, at least this earthly stage of it, does not stop until God determines in the fullness of time to bring everything to completion in the consummation of all things. But if, as we argue here, this adventure is a category that equally describes God, then we doubt it will stop once Jesus returns to redeem his people. Adventure will be part of our continued experience of life in God. Heaven will not be a place where all life as movement and growth will cease and all that we will do is sit on clouds and play harps in some sort of perpetual Sunday worship experience. Well, at least we really hope not, because that would be a serious anticlimax!</p>
<p>If God is the missio Dei, the missionary God, and if redemption is an intrinsic aspect of his nature and being, then whatever heavenly existence we will experience then must still involve something of this aspect of God. Life, and particularly life in God, will always involve dynamic movement, growth, development, change, participation... adventure. In other words, to co-opt the language of philosophy, adventure is not just an existential phenomenon, it has ontological status. If heaven is an adventure, then we had better get used to it and get into it, because there is going to be a lot of it to come.</p>
<p>And the church, the redeemed people who follow Jesus the great Adventurer, archetypal Hero, apocalyptic Rider, and courageous Savior, ought to be a place where there is great adventure and the risk of faith and mission—for to love God is to become like him. If this is not the case, we have good cause to question whether we have truly encountered Jesus and are worshiping the right God.</p>
<p>Christianity is an adventure of the spirit or it is not Christianity.</p>
<p>We must repent of our obsession with safety and security and do the task that only we as Jesus’s people can do. And so we finish with The Beginning of the End something of a creedal affirmation that for us sums up something of the call to adventurous mission and discipleship.</p>
<p>I would rather be ashes than dust!</p>
<p>I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it be stifled by dry rot.</p>
<p>I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.</p>
<p>The proper function of man is to live, not exist.</p>
<p>I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.</p>
<p>I shall use my time.</p>
<p>—Jack London</p>
