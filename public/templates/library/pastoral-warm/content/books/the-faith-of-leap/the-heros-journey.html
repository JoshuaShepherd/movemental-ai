<h1>Chapter 4: The Hero's Journey</h1>
<p>—André Gide It is my desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing which I cannot do with my whole heart. Having said this, I have said all.</p>
<p>—Ralph Waldo Emerson The conversion and subsequent mission of Patrick to the Irish peoples started one of the most remarkable movements in the history of the church, a movement destined to "save civilization" and embed the gospel in the West. One of the slogans of this remarkable movement was "the cell and the coracle." This strange phrase actually refers to the two central aspects/rhythms of the Celtic movement.</p>
<p>The "cell" refers to the place of contemplative prayer—where the monks and nuns spent time alone before God as well as in community worship. The notion of the cell as central to the life of the Irish monastics captures well the profound commitment to intimacy with God that was reflected in their leaders of the movement (Patrick, Aidan, Brendan, etc.).</p>
<p>The "coracle," on the other hand, describes a round, keelless, flatbottomed boat made from woven wood covered in skins or canvas and waterproofed with tar. While it was expected that all members of the movement have a rich life of worship and prayer—as would be presumed with monastics—it was also expected that all would be involved in the mission to evangelize Ireland, Britain, and Europe.</p>
<p>One of the bravest things the Celts did was something we, in our culture of fear, would probably call plain foolhardy. About four of them would get into these little boats where they would pray something like this: “Lord of the wind and the waves, take us your servants to where you will.” Then, trusting themselves to the sovereign God and his desire to redeem all peoples, they would push out into the ocean, allowing the tides to sweep them up and, hopefully, to land them on some shore where they would then proceed to preach the gospel to the people there! Talk about the faith of leap! With such zealous devotion and commitment to God and his mission, no wonder the Celtic Movement is credited with evangelizing Western Europe during the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>This kind of commitment to God and gospel harks back to Jesus (and the other biblical heroes) of course, but it has particular roots in the life and ministry of St. Paul. Undoubtedly, Paul is one of the most remarkable spiritual heroes of all time. The sheer quality of his character, the focus of his life, the passion of his spirituality, and the creative brilliance of his theology have changed the world forever. Other than Jesus, who has a unique and founding role, Paul is the apostle of the church. But we must remember that apostles are primarily pioneering idea-missionaries who advance the gospel onto new ground and at the same time provide meaningful leadership for movements. But at the core, the nonnegotiable task of the biblical apostles was to guard and maintain the missionary impulses of the church.1 In pursuit of this task then, one of the most powerful metaphors of Paul’s missionary journeys is that of the scarlet track of a bleeding hare across the snow. The image, first employed in a sermon The Hero’s Journey by John Henry Jowett, of a startling red slash across the whitened landscape reminds us that Paul’s ministry was one of constant selfemptying. This brave, rather unlikely hero led his band of spiritual warriors to and fro across the Roman Empire, all the while bleeding for their cause, the redemption of that very empire. What he experiences along the way is extreme and relentless liminality. But in the same process he also gets as close to God as a man can get (2 Cor.</p>
<p>12:1–5; Phil. 3:7–11), he reframes theological thinking for all time, and he starts a transformative movement of the gospel of Jesus into the Greco-Roman world that extends down through the corridors of time to this very time and place in which we stand.</p>
<p>Even before he began any of his missionary campaigns, Paul was no stranger to high adventure. Soon after his conversion, he had been forced to escape quite dramatically from Damascus after hearing of a conspiracy to kill him. By the time he embarks on what is now known as the first missionary journey, he has spent time in retreat in Arabia, led the church in Antioch, and debated the apostle Peter in Jerusalem. But when we read about his three missionary journeys (Acts 13–14, 15b–18a, 18b–21 respectively), we are introduced to a man who (with various companions) provides a pretty unique insight into the anatomy of spiritual heroism.</p>
<p>The early church was founded upon the images of Paul and his compatriots trekking mountain paths, taking beatings, enduring imprisonment and trials, contending with riots, surviving earthquakes, debating scholars and wizards, upsetting businessmen and religious leaders, as well as planting churches, preaching the gospel, and healing the sick. They formed the blueprint for the earliest models of Christian mission, models that presupposed risk, movement, energy, opposition, and triumph. Paul summarizes his experience for the Corinthians when again he feels compelled to defend his position as an apostle: I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.</p>
<p>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. (2 Cor. 11:23–27) And while reading this passage is as uncomfortable as it is exhausting, we should remember that Paul, who had his faults, also maintained a ministry that spanned thirty years and was not all blood, sweat, and tears. There were times of relative stability, real joy in the gospel, deep comradeship in ministry, churches planted and disciples developed, and long periods in prison, which for him, at least, meant productive writing time.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Paul led an unusually full and adventurous life!</p>
<p>His missionary journeys, his time in the coracle so to speak, were times of death-defying adventure. The details of these journeys are well known to many readers, but they bear repeating to remind us that from the outset of the Christian movement, risk and adventure were central to the church’s understanding of mission. Taken as a whole, here is a life well-lived... one worthy of study and emulation. He tells us to imitate him as he follows Christ (1 Cor. 4:16; 11:1). Paul is and remains a lasting symbol of spiritual heroism and model of Christlike discipleship.</p>
<p>Heroes are important not only because they symbolize what we believe to be important, but because they also convey universal truths about personal self-discovery and self-transcendence, one’s role in society, and the relation between the two. We can do with more heroes like Paul and the Celtic missionaries around in our day.</p>
<h2>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</h2>
<p>Paul’s letters are like dispatches from the Front, and it is impossible to fully appreciate his ecclesiology without noting the soil from which it grew—adventure and risk under the guiding hand of God.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as we’ve noted, so much of that sense of adventure is gone from the experience of local churches.</p>
<p>When trying to understand the nature of adventure, we can’t help but turn to the acknowledged expert in the field of myth and The Hero’s Journey myth-making, Joseph Campbell. In 1949, Campbell published The Hero with a Thousand Faces. For what was essentially a piece of esoteric comparative mythology, it struck a surprisingly deep chord with readers. It has become a twentieth-century nonfiction classic, coming to prominence in popular culture with the release of George Lucas’s Star Wars films, which Lucas claimed were inspired by Campbell. Campbell proposed the theory that important myths from around the world and throughout the ages all share a fundamental structure, which he termed the mono-myth. Whether they be ancient stories like those of the samurai from Japan, or the Maori warrior stories from New Zealand, or more contemporary stories like the heroic cowboy myth from the American West, Campbell contended that they are all essentially telling the same storyline: that of the hero’s journey.</p>
<p>Campbell summarized the mono-myth as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region
of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and
a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But there’s much more to it than that. Campbell had exegeted hun-
dreds of myths from around the world and from every epoch of
human history, and he kept finding the same structure. The take-
interests us is the fact that at its core, this mono-myth is a story of</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be no surprise that the world’s great myth-makers and storytellers—Hollywood—eventually got interested in Campbell’s writings. In the late 1980s, Disney screenwriter Christopher Vogler read Campbell and was so taken by the simplicity of his ideas that he sent out a now legendary seven-page company memo for all Disney screenwriters, entitled A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces. The logic was simple. If people resonate with this story, and can’t seem to get enough of it, let’s give it to them as often as we can. In the memo, and the subsequent book, The Writer’s Journey, Vogler simplified Campbell’s hero myth into the following twelve stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ordinary World—the hero's normal world before the story</li>
</ol>
<p>begins;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Call to Adventure—the hero is presented with a problem, challenge, or adventure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refusal of the Call—the hero refuses the challenge or journey,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>usually because he’s scared or wounded by previous experiences in some way;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Meeting with the Mentor—the hero meets a mentor to gain</li>
</ol>
<p>advice or training for the adventure;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Crossing the First Threshold—the hero leaves the ordinary</li>
</ol>
<p>world and goes into the special world;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Tests, Allies, Enemies—the hero faces tests, meets allies, confronts enemies, and learns the rules of the Special World;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approach—the hero has hit setbacks during tests &#x26; may need</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>try a new idea;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Ordeal—the biggest life or death crisis;</li>
<li>Reward—the hero has survived death, overcomes his fear, and</li>
</ol>
<p>now earns the reward;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>The Road Back—the hero must return to the Ordinary World;</li>
<li>Resurrection Hero—another test where the hero faces death—</li>
</ol>
<p>he has to use everything he’s learned;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Return with Elixir—the hero returns from the journey with the</li>
</ol>
<p>“elixir,” and uses it to help everyone in the Ordinary World.3 With this list, you can describe just about every Hollywood movie that attains blockbuster status.</p>
<p>If this looks a tad complex, it is worth noting that Campbell himself believed few myths contain all of these stages—some contain most of the stages, while others contain only some of them.</p>
<p>Whatever the details, the stages may be organized into three main sections: Departure (sometimes called Separation), I nitiation, and Return. Departure deals with the hero venturing forth on the quest, I nitiation deals with the hero’s various adventures along the way, and Return deals with the hero’s return home with knowledge and powers acquired on the journey.</p>
<p>At the point of rediscovering the power of their own myth-making through reading Campbell, the Disney studio was on the ropes. It hadn’t produced a hit since the Herbie the Volkswagon films of the The Hero’s Journey late ’70s. Once the Vogler memo went out and writers deliberately started using the structure of Campbell’s mono-myth, Disney released Honey, IShrunk the Kids and The Little Mermaid in 1989 and followed that with Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), and Toy Story (1995). They were back in the game.</p>
<p>Each of those films sticks very closely to Vogler’s distillation of Campbell’s hero myth. For example, in The Lion King, young Simba finds himself in the idyllic world of the Pride Lands of the Serengeti, oblivious to the challenges that will soon face him (Ordinary World).</p>
<p>His scheming and embittered uncle Scar lures Simba into a gorge and stirs up a wildebeest stampede, which results in the death of Simba’s father, Mufasa (Call to Adventure). Simba escapes to another part of the jungle, leaving Scar to rule the Pride Lands. When, as an adult, he is approached by his childhood sweetheart, Nala, and asked to return and take his place as king, Simba refuses, believing he caused his father’s death (Refusal of the Call). Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, aided by the appearance of the ghost of Mufasa (Meeting with the Mentor).</p>
<p>Once back at Pride Rock, Simba is horrified to see the condition of the Pride Lands under Scar’s monarchy (Crossing the First Threshold). His friends Timon and Pumbaa create a diversion, allowing Simba and Nala to sneak past the hyenas guarding Pride Rock (Tests, Allies, Enemies) where Simba sees his mother Sarabi struck by Scar for criticizing him. Outraged, Simba announces his return. In response, Scar tells the pride that Simba was responsible for Mufasa’s death and corners Simba at the edge of Pride Rock (Approach).</p>
<p>As Simba dangles over the edge of Pride Rock, Scar proudly but quietly reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba leaps up and pins Scar to the ground, forcing him to admit the truth to the pride. Araging battle then ensues between the hyenas and the lionesses (Ordeal).</p>
<p>The lions win the battle, and Simba corners Scar and forces him into exile (Reward). Simba is installed to his rightful place as king of the Pride Lands (Return to the Ordinary World), but Scar only pretends to leave and turns to attack Simba, resulting in a final duel which is ultimately won by Simba (Resurrection Hero). The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala’s newborn cub as the heir to the throne (Return with Elixir).</p>
<p>We could unpack nearly every Disney film made since 1989 and find the same mythic structure. Vogler’s genius was in noting that this story resonates so deeply with audiences that they will take it any way they can get it. In the 1992 book that resulted from his memo, he exegetes films as diverse as Mad Max and Four Weddings and a Funeral, finding the same essential structure to their storylines. Of course, the mono-myth idea applies to all movies, and so Vogler would have a field day with more obviously adventurous films like the Lord of the Rings and the Matrix trilogies, Titanic, Avatar, and the recent crop of superhero films like the Spiderman and Batman series. In fact, in identifying the structure of myth, Joseph Campbell captured the desires in the human heart to which all great stories refer—the desire for redemption, being part of something greater, good ultimately triumphing against evil, etc.</p>
<p>What Did Jesus Do?</p>
<p>Our point isn’t to make an examination of popular film but to illustrate that the yearning for a heroic adventure lies just beneath the surface of our consciousness; film, television, literature, sports, and travel are in a sense vicarious adventures. But because they are vicarious adventures, we can live them out through the lives and stories on the screen. They can act as inoculations against the real adventure virus that we need to expose ourselves to.</p>
<p>If Campbell and Vogler are right—and what they have articulated resonates well with our most primal and elemental story—we should pay close attention to it. It tells us something important about all human yearning. Note the remarkable parallels between Campbell’s heroic journey and the story of Paul; the calling of Moses; the vocations of Isaiah, Jeremiah, or the Twelve, for that matter.</p>
<p>But when it comes to Jesus, you can pretty much check off each of Campbell’s stages against the Gospel narratives of Matthew, Mark, or Luke. I nterestingly, it’s as though the gospel story of Jesus is the archetypal heroic journey, the embodiment of the very adventure that all people in every epoch have desired. Consider the following table which can be used to outline the story of Jesus as the Hero’s journey.</p>
<p>The Hero’s Journey</p>
<h2>Stages Vogler/Campbell Gospel</h2>
<p>Ordinary The hero’s normal world beWe meet Jesus growing up in obscurity World fore the story begins; in the ordinary town of Nazareth, and eventually working as a carpenter; Call to The hero is presented with Jesus is increasingly aware of his calling Adventure a problem, challenge, or but awaits the appointed hour to comadventure; mence his public ministry; Refusal of The hero refuses the challenge Well, maybe there’s no correlation here, the Call or journey, usually because he’s but as a man he does obediently submit scared; himself to the will of God.</p>

<p>Ordinary World.</p>
<p>The correlation between Campbell's elemental story and the story of the Gospels tells us that Jesus is actually the object of all human yearning. We want him, we want to live like him, we want to know him. His is the story in the hearts of all true storytellers. When telling heroic stories about Jedi knights or samurai warriors, Viking invaders or Texan sheriffs, Zion versus Babylon in the Matrix series, or the redemption of cynical, wounded warriors in Avatar, storytellers are inadvertently retelling the Jesus story, albeit partly or inaccurately.</p>
<h2>Myth-Making</h2>
<p>So much for the structure of myth, what about the meaning of myth?</p>
<p>Why is it so important, and why does it seem to have such a potent hold on the human imagination and such direct access to the human heart? Hopefully when we grasp this, we will understand the potency of story, adventure, and our sense of involvement in the unfolding of events. Here we must turn to that great re-mythologizer of gospel truths, C. S. Lewis, for help. But first we must understand what we mean by myth here: It is “the dramatization in temporal terms of things seen from the non-temporal standpoint of eternity.... Amyth is not about something that once happened, but rather about something that is always happening; the narration of a divine event.”4 Myth is therefore not just a story, it is the Story beyond the story, and it is the realm in which people most live. And because it appeals to the depths of human longing and search, it acts as a kind of master key to the soul—we can use it on what door we like. Listen to C. S. Lewis: The value of the myth is that it takes all the things we know and restores to them the rich significance which has been hidden by the “veil of familiarity.” The child enjoys his cold meats (otherwise dull to him) by pretending it is a buffalo, just killed with his own bow and arrow. And the child is wise. The real meat comes back to him more savory for having been dipped in a story: you might say that only then is it the real meat. If you are tired of the old real landscape, look at it in a mirror. By putting bread, gold, horse, apple, or the very roads into a myth, [Lewis is here talking of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings] we do not retreat from reality, we rediscover it. And as long as the story lingers in our mind, the real things are more themselves.5 The Hero’s Journey Speaking of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, Lewis says that the myth of Sauron teaches us that evil is real and enduring; that the war of the Ring is only one of a thousand wars against him. Every time we shall be wise to fear his ultimate victory, after which there will be “no more songs.” “Every time we win we shall know that our victory is impermanent.”6 If we insist on having a moral of the story, that is it: a recall “to that hard, yet not quite desperate insight into Man’s unchanging predicament by which heroic ages have lived.”7 Lewis says elsewhere that if we take the imagery of Scripture seriously, if we believe that God will one day give us the Morning Star and cause us to put on the splendor of the sun, then... both the ancient myths and the modern poetry, so false as history, may be very near the truth as prophecy.... We cannot mingle with the splendors we see. But all the leaves of the New Testament are rustling with the rumor that it will not always be so.8 And the wonderful thing is that for us as Christians, we can draw deeply from the wells of longing for redemption that is part of the structure of myth. C. S. Lewis also suggested that all people harbor desires they cannot name, memories of a home they have lost, traces of a story they love but have forgotten. In his essay “The Weight of Glory,” he writes, “We cannot tell it because it is a desire for something that has never actually appeared in our experience. We cannot hide it because our experience is constantly suggesting it, and we betray ourselves like lovers at the mention of a name.”9 This desire, he said, is precisely for the glory which Jesus has promised, and every whisper or trace of that glory sets off our desire for it once again. Of course, our understanding of what it means remains inchoate and symbolic, for we cannot grasp it, yet the thing we desire is real, and we have been made to find our fulfillment in it. We would suggest, following Lewis, that the reason the hero’s journey has appealed to so many throughout history and continues to bedazzle its hearers to this day, is because it piques our desire for the glory of Jesus. Lewis said, “For they [our yearnings] are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have not visited.”10 Why explore this material on myth-making here? Well, we think it vital to touch base with it because it clearly has a significance in and helps us understand human longing and therefore human motivation. It also gives us insight into the mythic appeal and nature of the gospel as adventure, because the very concept of the incarnation and the missio dei are in some way basic to all myths that incorporate adventure at the center of the story. Again it was Lewis who noted,</p>
<p>As myth transcends thought, Incarnation transcends myth. The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact. The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history. It happens—at a particular date, in a particular place followed by definable historical consequences.... By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth: that is the miracle.11 Campbell’s hero story resonates because it is like news from another country. In this respect we would suggest that our love of extreme sports, our quest for adventure, our desire for heroic novels and films, all play into this same yearning. They are the echoes of an unheard tune—the story of Jesus. The quest for heroic adventure then is a quest for the gospel, although it might not be seen that way by everyone. And so, when churches distance themselves from such adventure, they are inhibiting a fundamental human impulse and desire to be part of something significant that has eternal consequences.</p>
<h2>Reel Communitas</h2>
<p>Hollywood knows how to reach into human hearts, and we can take a page from their book in trying to renovate our message and our churches through the power of the gospel. What better way to illustrate the power of liminality-communitas than to explore their mythic re-presentation in the form of movies?</p>
<p>For instance, as referenced earlier, liminality-communitas was powerfully captured in Peter Jackson’s epic movie of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. This story has all the hallmarks of our greatest mythic portrayals of adventure. Against all odds, and up against the most evil of foes, the most unlikely group is forged into the The Hero’s Journey Fellowship of the Ring that together saves the day and changes the course of history.</p>
<p>In the third installment, The Return of the King, there is a charming scene where, after Frodo and Sam have finally destroyed the ring and Mordor has been defeated, the four hobbits return to normal life in sleepy Hobbiton. There, they find themselves at a large wooden table at a noisy, busy inn. The other drinkers are laughing and carousing, going on with life as they had always known it. But Frodo and his friends have experienced an adventure like no other. They have looked death in the face many times, and by rallying together they have not only survived but triumphed over evil. What of this experience could their friends and neighbors possibly understand? As they raise their tankards of ale to their lips, they look at each other— a long, knowing look. As their eyes meet, something unspoken is powerfully communicated. They know each other. No words can express what they’re thinking, but they know each other’s thoughts.</p>
<p>This is the society found only in communitas.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Rings trilogy are not the only films that celebrate communitas. In fact, the majority of movies have a liminality-communitas dialectic at their core. So many, in fact, that we suggest their popularity tells us something about the deep yearning for communitas we all share. We love watching films in which a band of friends find deeper connection through the challenges thrown at them by an external threat, precisely because we desire that same connection with our own friends. War movies like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and Blackhawk Down work because, not only do they attempt to depict war accurately, they focus on the intensity of the relationships forged between soldiers in combat. In Saving Private Ryan, the band of soldiers are stunned to learn that their captain (played by Tom Hanks) is in fact a schoolteacher in civilian life. In the liminal experience of war, he has been changed, enlarged, by the ordeal of leadership.</p>
<p>In buddy movies like Boys on the Side, Thelma and Louise, and Oceans 11 (12 &#x26; 13), the characters undertake a challenge and develop ever-deeper intimacy as the story unfolds. The same can be said for The Matrix trilogy and O Brother, Where Art Thou.</p>
<p>Even more powerful (and common) are those films where characters who are opposites are thrown together. In Rain Man, a selfish, immature young man (Tom Cruise) is forced to drive his autistic older brother (Dustin Hoffman) across America to retrieve his inheritance. By the end of the journey, Cruise’s character has been transformed by the relationship he has developed with his brother.</p>
<p>In the cult classic The Princess Bride, an unlikely band of adventurers (a pirate, a vengeful Spaniard, a giant, and a princess-to-be) are bound together in their attempt to overthrow an evil prince. Asimilarly unlikely bunch come together to build a baseball diamond in a corn field in Field of Dreams. And, of course, just about every Mighty Ducks–style sports film capitalizes on our desire to see a ragtag bunch of also-rans transformed into a force greater than the sum of the individual parts. And the daddy of all road movies, The Wizard of Oz, describes a liminal journey in which each character literally contributes a different part to the body as a whole—the Scarecrow’s brain, the Tin Man’s heart, the Lion’s courage, and Dorothy’s sense of destiny.</p>
<p>The hunger for community is a legitimate one, but to pursue it for its own sake is a mistake. When we seek to build community without the experience of liminality, all we end up with is the kind of pseudocommunity that pervades many churches. It’s more like a support group than a communitas. In David Fincher’s incendiary film Fight Club, the main character/narrator, played by Edward Norton, is lost in a quagmire of materialism and meaninglessness. He has an odious job as a recall coordinator for a major automobile company and tries to fill the void in his life by buying new furnishings and appliances for his I kea-inspired home. The pain is too great, though, leading to a numbing cycle of sleepless nights and pointless days. When he tries to get some prescription drugs for his insomnia, his doctor refuses, unsympathetically comparing his psychological “pain” with the real physical pain experienced by victims of testicular cancer.</p>
<p>In reaction, Norton’s character attends a support group for cancer sufferers and soon finds himself becoming addicted to a variety of support groups. For the first time in his life, he gets in touch with his emotions and cries freely. However, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist in the land of genuine suffering, spoils this therapeutic release for him by holding up a mirror to his dishonesty.</p>
<p>Norton’s character wants the kind of community he can find at a support group. And for a time it is helpful, but it has its limits. He The Hero’s Journey can never fully realize the kind of communion he desires because he is not on the same threshold as the other members of the group.</p>
<p>He and Marla don’t actually have cancer or alcoholism. They can look like sufferers, faking it for a period, but ultimately the ordeal of cancer is not one they can share. For communitas to develop, the members of a group must all be involved in the same challenge. In Terence Malik’s war film The Thin Red Line, Tony Shalhoub plays a captain who refuses to order his men over a ridge, knowing that it is securely held by well-armed Japanese forces. Despite several orders from above he steadfastly refuses to give the word to charge the hill.</p>
<p>Later, when he is relieved of his duty, he talks to his men declaring that they are like his sons. They gather around to bid him farewell, knowing he has shared their ordeal and saved them from certain death. This scene can be juxtaposed with a later one, where, after the campaign has ended, the new captain (George Clooney), who has never seen action, gives the men a speech in which he says they should look at him as if he were their father. Shalhoub’s speech is heartfelt and moving. Clooney’s is shallow and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Building community for its own sake is like attending a cancer support group without having cancer. It’s like asking soldiers you haven’t fought with to imagine you are their father. And it’s like a church demanding allegiance and weekly attendance without linking its attenders with a cause to which they can give their lives. It’s no different from the church holding endless Bible study groups or supplying countless sermons for the purpose of learning information that will rarely be utilized. Have you ever noticed how many men will attend church occasionally and begrudgingly, but when there is a church working bee, they’ll turn up joyfully and work hard all day?</p>
<p>Working bees create a mini-communitas. So do short-term mission trips and youth mission trips. So does church planting. But simply attending weekly church services does not. It’s like sitting at the apostles’ feet and drinking in their teaching in Jerusalem in the first century. It might serve some purpose, we suppose. But the ultimate purpose of the Jerusalem church was to go and make disciples of all nations. There’s no question that the apostles’ teaching was essential, but not as an end in itself. Their teaching was meant to mobilize ordinary believers to go into the world, baptizing new disciples and teaching them all that Christ commanded them. As mentioned earlier, it wasn’t until persecution drove the first Christians out of Jerusalem that they discovered their purpose, and that purpose threw them together into a liminal state, as a missionary movement.</p>
<p>Attending a respectable, middle-class church in a respectable, middle-class neighborhood is not usually a liminal experience. Joining a peace movement in a nation obsessed with military might is.</p>
<p>Traveling to I ndonesia to help with the International relief effort after a tsunami is. Joining a church planting team is. Why do our churches often miss this experience of communitas? For no other reason than that they often avoid liminality, opting for a safer, more secure environment.</p>
<p>We’re not for a minute suggesting that Christian communitas shouldn’t cater to the need we all have for safety. Indeed they should.</p>
<p>But we must fashion safe spaces not as alternatives to missional engagement in our world, but as parallel experiences to that engagement. Whenever we have led or been part of a missions team, we have ensured that there are protocols for those who are tired, emotionally depleted, or spiritually dry to retreat and be replenished. But this hasn’t stopped the mission from continuing. It happens parallel to the ongoing purpose of the team. Rather than seeing the safety of community as the end result of someone else’s adventure, we need to see it more like a way station on the side of the road—a much needed rest for the journey ahead. This much we can be sure of: we have not yet arrived, there is still a lot of work to be done, and our King is coming.</p>
<h2>You Are a Hero, Now Be One</h2>
<p>As we have seen, mission is the church’s primary form of adventure, or at least the catalyst of it. By allowing the great divorce between church and mission, we are selling people short. We don’t do people any favors by protecting them from the adventure of a missional journey. One of two things usually happens when we restrain our people from diving into adventure. Either they abandon the Christian adventure in search of something seemingly more exciting, or they launch out into a solo experience of mission. But when we The Hero’s Journey factor the adventure of mission into the equation, then everything the church does is somehow connected to, or catalyzed by, mission, including discipleship. We raise young men and women to embrace the missional vocation as a distinct and inseparable part of their identity as a Jesus follower. They are missionaries, embarking on the missionary’s journey right from the start.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how exciting it would be for young Christians if they understood their vocation as disciples as not dissimilar from the hero’s journey—including a call to adventure, the role of mentors and friends and allies, and the importance of trials and ordeals?</p>
<p>Overcoming for the cause? Currently, young Christians reach adulthood bored with their church experience, and with little or no sense of their calling as missionaries. They have been taught the Bible since they were little, but they have so little use for the information they have been given that it goes in one ear and out the other.</p>
<p>What would happen if we saw ourselves as embarking on an incredible adventure together, and if the learning we received was pertinent to the very ordeal we were undertaking? It’s not unlike those safety announcements you get on every airplane flight you take—you seriously don’t think you’re going to have to ditch into the Atlantic or make a miraculous landing on the Hudson River, so you pay no attention to them. Compare your attitude toward safety announcements on commercial airlines to the instruction you receive when going skydiving for the first time. You pay the utmost attention to those skydiving instructions. It’s a matter of life or death!</p>
<p>We have a friend who says she believes churches should get Bible teaching “on a need-to-know basis.” In other words, a church should open their Bibles together and learn from Scripture according to the contextual challenges and ordeals they are currently facing together.</p>
<p>Sadly, many Christians don’t “need to know” what they hear each Sunday, and so they retain very little of it. Preachers end up feeling like neglected flight stewards being ignored by their complacent passengers throughout the safety announcement.</p>
<p>Now, we recognize believers should have a clear, consistent biblical worldview, and we can’t offer Bible teaching based only on felt needs and areas of immediate interest. But frankly, we’d rather teach missionaries, disciples who are hungry for Bible teaching to sustain, enrich, and guide them in the missional ordeal, than churchgoers who have little motivation for hearing the truth. And remember, unused truth is lost truth. It doesn’t matter how true we believe the Bible to be, or how effective and gifted our teachers might be. If our congregations are not engaged missionally in the ongoing work of serving the poor, feeding the hungry, challenging society, preaching the gospel, and responding to unbelief, they will have little need for our teaching.</p>
<p>Returning to Paul’s ministry, we see what it looks like when mission organizes the discipleship function of a church. Paul had nothing but praise for his beloved Thessalonians, about whom he said, We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.</p>
<p>We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake. (1 Thess. 1:2–5)</p>
<p>Here he mentions the Thessalonians’ faith, love, and hope. They seemed to understand what the Corinthians had yet to grasp (and so Paul spells it out for them, and us, in 1 Corinthians 13). He also marvels at the Spirit’s work in their midst and their deep sense of conviction about the truth of the gospel. This is praise any church today would appreciate, but Paul continues, because the faith of the Thessalonians is demonstrated not only by conviction or spiritual manifestation. It is demonstrated in their missional vocation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffer-
ing, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God has become known everywhere.</p>
<p>Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God. (1 Thess. 1:6–9) Paul sees a direct link between faith and missional action. We suspect this might have been informed by his own experience. At The Hero’s Journey the very point of his conversion on the road to Damascus, he is commissioned an apostle to the Gentiles. Paul reports this several times. Conversion and commissioning are interlinked for him, and it seems he cannot imagine faith without calling.</p>
<p>The Thessalonians are models to all believers in that region of the world at that time because their faith produced missional muscle.</p>
<p>They turned from idols to the true and living God, and then in spite of persecution they turned resolutely to their calling as missionaries. In so doing they joined a viral church planting movement with one communitas after another taking the gospel to all of Asia, as it was then known.</p>
<p>When mission catalyzes discipleship, new believers should be commissioned as missionaries and mentored by mature missionaries, not merely to learn the names of all the books in the Bible in order, but to discern God’s greater calling in their lives and to knit this calling to their conversion to Christ. Too many believers have experienced the great divorce we spoke of earlier. Being converted and being called to mission are seen as two separate experiences, the latter being entirely optional and only for the stout-hearted.</p>
<h2>Broadening It All Out</h2>
<p>So far, our discussion of the heroic paradigm could give the impression that we are calling people to discover their own personal, individualistic quest, like Frodo. But the challenge of risky adventure is invariably a communal challenge. It is a band of fellow travelers thrown together to engage a greater cause than one of their number could undertake. We need to broaden Campbell’s hero myth to include, or more accurately, to presuppose, a collective rather than an individual.</p>
<p>Also, one of the most common complaints we have received about our thoughts on liminal church is that people can’t imagine living their lives in a constant state of heightened missional activity. Surely, they ask, there must be time for contemplation, regeneration, worship, and time alone with God. Nowhere do we suggest otherwise. As we began, mission must be seen as one of the four primary functions of the church, together with discipleship, worship, and community.</p>
<p>And as we said from the outset, mission is a marvelous catalyst, or organizer, of those other functions, but it must not be undertaken to the exclusion of them.</p>
<p>A way to make this clearer is found in the book Metavista, written by two friends of ours, Colin Greene and Martin Robinson. In it they present what they call the “missional matrix,” an interactive framework for understanding how a community organized by mission could be shaped without compromising the essential biblical nature of the church. This framework also helps to make sense of the idea of collective heroism. They identify five broad elements to healthy missional activity: leadership, discipleship, mobilization, societal engagement, and communitas. And they see these elements being undertaken within four dimensions. We reproduce it with slight developments here:12 Figure 4.1 internal communities discipleship</p>

<h2>A Missional Matrix</h2>
<h2>The Missional Matrix</h2>
<p>According to Greene and Robinson, the Christian is responsible to serve and strengthen the internal life of the church, as well as being The Hero’s Journey involved in the mission, or external dimension, of the church. While we are called to be active and reliable members of the community of believers, we are also loved by God as individuals, and our individuality is never subsumed into the corporate. The church is not an all-assimilating collective like a beehive; it is made of unique individuals bearing the unique stamp of the imago Dei. This is seen in Jesus’s delightful stories of the one lost coin, the one lost sheep, and the one lost brother (Luke 15). When we discuss the power and importance of communitas, we do so knowing that it must be seen as one of the dimensions of the church’s life and mission. Alan developed this idea in his model of a missional DNA in The Forgotten Ways, where he highlighted communitas as one of the essential features of a missional community.</p>
<p>With these four dimensions in mind, Greene and Robinson then develop four quadrants in which the missional life of a church unfolds. They are the internal-individual, the external-individual, the external-community, and the internal-community. In each of these quadrants, a different aspect of missional life is catalyzed. It should also be borne in mind that each of the quadrants informs and inspires the others in some measure as well (indicated by the doubleheaded arrows in the diagram above). By examining each of these quadrants, we can show that while communitas is essential, it sits within a broader matrix of missional activity.</p>
<ol>
<li>The I nternal-Individual Quadrant—Discipleship</li>
</ol>
<p>The church is responsible to create and mature individual disciples, and this is an “internal” aspect of the church, although as we stated earlier, engagement in mission is a marvelous catalyst for discipling believers. Greene and Robinson indicate this in their diagram by showing how the mobilizing of believers into mission helps shape them as disciples. Unless the church is equipping believers to embrace the values and vision of the kingdom of God and turn away from the materialism, consumerism, greed and power of the present age, it not only abandons its biblical mandate, it is rendered missionally ineffective. Greene and Robinson identify two particular aspects of disciple-making: developing habits of the heart, and embracing spiritual disciplines. On the former they say, “The phrase habits of the heart is used to describe those core disciplines which are normally built deeply into the lives of individuals and communities and enable those individuals and communities to flourish.”13 Following Robert Bellah, from whom they borrow the phrase, they identify important habits of the heart as including an orientation toward community rather than rampant individualism, an abandonment of consumerism, and a separation of happiness from virtue.</p>
<p>From the platform of these transformative habits of the heart, the authors then suggest we build a number of spiritual disciplines and undergird a deepening and developing commitment to discipleship.</p>
<p>They point out, Spiritual disciplines offer us a range of commitments and rhythms which build on other good habits, further reinforcing them but also moving us closer to a capacity to hear God and so develop a sense of direction in relation to our calling or vocation in the world.14 This is nothing we haven’t written ourselves in such books as Untamed (Alan) and Exiles (Michael), but it does very helpfully place the exercise of spiritual disciplines within the broader matrix of missional engagement. In our opinion, most people write about spiritual disciplines as though they are ends in themselves, or at least divorced from the liminality of adventurous discipleship. For instance, we have never seen risk-taking, or even mission, suggested as a spiritual exercise. But seeing them as one quadrant, necessarily catalyzed by missional mobilization and in the context of communitas, is very helpful. This takes us back to the Celts’ cell and coracle that we mentioned earlier. They are not mutually exclusive experiences. Indeed, each is diminished markedly by the absence of the other.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The External-Individual Quadrant—Mobilization</li>
</ol>
<p>When individual believers are adequately discipled—taught, mentored, corrected, encouraged—they cannot but live out their deep devotion to Jesus in their homes, their workplaces, and their leisure pursuits. This is the external-individual aspect of mission, the mobilization of disciples into the world. Indeed, this is the very place that such discipleship is to be lived out. As David Bosch says, The Hero’s Journey Discipleship is determined by the relation to Christ himself, not by mere conformity to impersonal commands. The context of this is not in the classroom (where “teaching” normally takes place), or even in the church, but in the world.15 Every believer who takes seriously their vocation as a disciple of Jesus will see themselves as a “sent one” wherever they find themselves, and will look to be mobilized into action in that place. As Greene and Robinson make clear,</p>
<p>There comes a time when as individuals we accept responsibility for the calling we have been given and begin to experiment with a specific ministry to serve others. Every Christian has a vocation that needs to be exercised.16 This could take the form of being a “good witness” at work or a good neighbor to those who live nearby, or it could involve volunteering to serve on the PTA or the local neighborhood watch committee. These are the kinds of things individual Christians involve themselves in as an expression of their devotion to Jesus. But there are also those communal missional projects where we are encouraged to join with other believers in a concerted effort for the sake of the gospel. This leads us to the third quadrant.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The External-Community Quadrant—</li>
</ol>
<p>Societal Engagement Greene and Robinson’s third quadrant sees believers joining together in a missional project, or a “societal engagement,” to use their expression. While affirming the importance of being a strong Christian example in our workplaces, they also point out that it is necessary and important for us to find opportunities to work together as disciples on a joint project. They explain,</p>
<p>The mobilization of many individuals requires a social context in which the ministries that mobilization produces can be exercised.</p>
<p>Most Christians will engage with the world within a relatively small distance from their home and workplace. Of course, for some people the workplace can be a huge distance from the home and that raises particular challenges for those individuals—but again, most people wish for some kind of engagement with the community of people where they worship, where they have friends, where their children go to school, and where they play sport or socialize with others.17 This external-community quadrant is essential for healthy mission, and we would argue, for healthy discipleship. Many people have told us that they see their primary “calling” is to serve the church and to simply be a good witness at work and in their neighborhood. They have no need, nor desire, to join a communal missional project. But when this quadrant is missing, so is the opportunity for communitas, and indeed, so is the opportunity for healthy discipleship. There is something insidious about the idea of solo discipleship. As we mentioned earlier, Paul’s letters were written to communities, and they presuppose a communal response to the teaching they contain. We don’t dismiss the validity and importance of individual witness, but we can’t step away from the biblical imperative of communal mission.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The I nternal-Community Quadrant—Communitas</li>
</ol>
<p>When disciples adopt a communal missional project, they find that the internal-community dynamic is that of communitas. As we’ve been saying, the communal aspect of the church-in-mission is that deep, intimate sense of comradeship Victor Turner termed communitas.</p>
<p>We don’t intend to say much more here, other than to point out its relation to discipleship and engagement. According to Greene and Robinson’s missional matrix, you can’t expect to experience communitas unless you are engaged in mission with fellow disciples.</p>
<p>——— Having looked briefly at these four quadrants, it might be tempting to see them in some simplistic cause-and-effect relationship—when we disciple individuals, they will naturally be mobilized into action, and when enough of them are so mobilized, they will get involved in joint projects, and that in turn leads to communitas. It might be illustrated like this: Figure 4.2 discipleship action societal communitas (spiritual disciplines) (mobilization) engagement The Hero’s Journey By developing their model as a matrix, Greene and Robinson are indicating that there is no linear cause-and-effect at work here. It’s not as simple as assuming that if we disciple believers effectively, they will end up being mobilized into service. There are too many incidents of well-trained and discipled Christians never serving anyone. Likewise, it’s naive to assume that by just throwing people into a communal missional project, they will automatically experience communitas.</p>
<p>Indeed the matrix shows that all four quadrants play on each other quite dramatically. They need to be managed as concurrent priorities, believing that discipleship, personal witness, communal mission, and communitas catalyze and sharpen each other. Combining this with what we believe to be the four functions of the church (more on this later), this can be illustrated as follows: Figure 4.3 liminality risk communitas mission discipleship engagement disciplines spiritual societal missio Dei community worship action reflection (mobilization) mission adventure Our growth as disciples influences our personal mobilization and our communal engagement in society. Our communal engagement in society influences our experience of communitas and our growth as disciples. And so on. The missional matrix reminds us that keeping all four quadrants healthy is essential for effective mission. It reminds us that as much as we need to embark upon a heroic journey, we ought rarely to consider doing this alone. Never underestimate the power of an heroic band of brothers and sisters setting out on a risky journey to participate in the unfurling of the kingdom of God in the place where God sends them.</p>
