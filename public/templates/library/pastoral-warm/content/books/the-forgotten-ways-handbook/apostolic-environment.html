<h1>Apostolic Environment</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of environment allows the elements of mDNA, or “Apostolic
Genius,” to flourish? What kind of environment released the spontaneous
growth of the Chinese and the New Testament churches? In The Forgotten
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In every movement there is a powerful form of influence that weaves its way through the chaotic network of churches and believers. There is no other substantial word for this catalytic influence other than, to reinvoke biblical language, apostolic. Wherever and whenever the church has significantly extended the mission of God or experienced rapid growth, there has always been apostolic leadership present in some form or another.</p>
<p>The apostolic person’s calling is essentially the extension of Christianity. As such, he or she calls the church to its essential calling and helps guide it to its destiny as a missionary people with a transformative message for the world. All other functions of the church must be qualified by its mission to extend the redemptive mission of God through its life and witness. The apostolic leader thus embodies, symbolizes, and re-presents the church’s mission to the missional community. Furthermore, he or she calls forth and develops the gifts and callings of all of God’s people. Without apostolic ministry, the church either forgets its high calling or fails to implement it successfully. Sadly, in declining denominational systems, such people are commonly “frozen out” or exiled, because they disturb the equilibrium of a system in stasis. This loss of the apostolic influencer is one of the major reasons for mainstream denominational decline. If we really want missional church, then we must have a missional leadership system to drive it—it’s that simple.</p>
<p>Two major challenges face us as we seek to appropriate apostolic ministry in the Western church. The first is confusion between the unique role and calling of the original apostles and that of present-day apostolic ministry. Many fail to see that contemporary apostolic ministry is a gifting that continues and enhances the original work of the New Testament apostles, particularly the Twelve. But apostolic ministry today does not alter the original apostolic ministry in the process. The net result of authentic apostolic ministry is the extension of Christianity through multiplication.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that many who claim apostolic gifting today do it an injustice and regularly discredit the role through the abuse of authority.</p>
<p>The apostolic leadership dynamic that needs to be emphasized is that of servant-inspirer, not one who “lords it over others.” It is more about spiritual authority than it is about organizational governance. Genuine apostolic ministry is authenticated by suffering and empowerment rather than by positional authority. It draws its authority from service and calling, from moral and spiritual influence.</p>
<h2>The Apostolic Task</h2>
<p>The essential role of the apostolic leader is to be a custodian of the DNA of God’s people, or to say it another way, the custodian of the gospel. But when we ask what this means in practice, we can break down the role into three primary functions, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>To embed mDNA through pioneering new ground for the gospel</li>
</ol>
<p>and the church.</p>
<p>The apostolic person is continually pioneering new missional initiatives and new churches to extend Christianity. This often involves cross-cultural work but is not limited to it. The apostolic leader continues to implant all aspects of mDNA in each community that is formed.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To guard mDNA through the application and integration of</li>
</ol>
<p>apostolic or missional theology.</p>
<p>The apostolic leader makes sure that each church remains true to the gospel and its missional ethos. He or she acts to create a web of meaning that holds the movement together through sharing stories, developing organizational ethos, corrective teaching, and cultivating leaders. Having imparted the mDNA in the first place, they then work to ensure churches do not mutate into something other than God intended them to be.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To create an environment where other ministries emerge.</li>
</ol>
<p>The apostolic gift creates the environment for the release and nurture of all other gifts listed in Ephesians 4. It is therefore the foundational gift that gives context to the prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral, and teaching gifts listed in Ephesians. This collection of gifts is identified as APEST. This role also creates the ecclesial fabric or network that is so important to a genuine movement ethos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now let us consider a few suggested habits and practices to create
environments where missional churches flourish and multiply.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suggested Habits and Practices</h2>
<p>In approaching the practicalities of creating an apostolic environment, remember the three key functions of apostolic ministry: to embed mDNA through pioneering new ground for the gospel, to guard mDNA through apostolic theology, and to create the environment for other ministries to emerge. Considering these overarching apostolic functions, we suggest the following five habits and related practices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pioneer and multiply</li>
<li>Cultivate Apostolic Genius</li>
<li>Foster community calling and uniqueness</li>
<li>Develop ministry capacity</li>
<li>Catalyze</li>
</ol>
<h2>Habit 1: Pioneer and Multiply</h2>
<p>Seeing that the apostolic calling is essentially about pioneering and multiplying Christianity, it’s best to start with this as a habit in and of itself.</p>
<p>This habit is located at the very heart of apostolic ministry. Nothing will establish a culture of pioneering and multiplication more than simply doing it. Easier said than done, we know! Here are a few practices to get you on your way.1</p>
<h2>Practice One: New Initiatives</h2>
<p>Regularly initiate new missionary incentives and communities. Many missional churches make a commitment to multiply their communities every twelve months. While we don’t want to suggest such a rigid timeframe for reproduction, we do wish to highlight this type of commitment as very healthy. This kind of practice will ensure that an apostolic ethos is integrated into the ministry culture. Always have something new that you’re dreaming and praying about together, training a team for, or taking the first steps toward. If you do this, over time pioneering and multiplying will become central to your collective identity.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Prepare New Missionary Teams To regularly start these incentives, new missionary teams need to be identified and developed. The apostolic role in this situation is to stimulate and guide this process but not to control or micromanage it. It is an empowering function that seeks to stir imagination and create a setting for team development and self-organization. This process takes time; to hurry is counterproductive. People need space to dream together and form camaraderie. If you don’t commit to this up front, it is doubtful you will ever get around to it, as other ministry issues crowd out the missional ones.</p>
<p>Grassroots leadership and team development are strategic activities; don’t leave them to chance.</p>
<p>Savvy missionary communities are continually preparing groups for new mission. In fact, each core unit of church (e. g., a cell group) within an existing community should be preparing for new mission and, in time, reproduce itself. For an example of the process for initiating new mission, see the chart  in chapter 4.</p>
<p>Proofer, this is the diagram about individual to corporate dreaming and the to contextual dreaming and practices and so on. It is in the Missional Incarnational chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice Three: Experiment like Mad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Oswald Sanders said, “Agreat deal more failure is the result of an excess of caution than of bold experimentation with new ideas. The frontiers of the Kingdom of God were never advanced by men and women of caution.” We say, just give it a go. At the heart of pioneering mission is a willingness to take risks. If it doesn’t work, you’ve just found another way not to do it, and everyone involved will have acquired new skills along the way.</p>
<p>Organic systems have trial and error built within their very nature.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that every context is different, there cannot be a one-sizefits-all approach, so experimentation is an essential practice if we want to find new ways to implant the gospel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a culture of permission to dream and try new things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apostolic ministry exists to stir and awaken the missionary purpose of God’s people. So go for it, dream, and experiment like mad!</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect as a church on the pioneering nature of Christianity</li>
</ul>
<p>throughout history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recall the inspiring examples of pioneering effort within scripture.</li>
<li>Create real-life action heroes. It is critical that people are actually</li>
</ul>
<p>attempting to do what is being discussed and learned. I nspire a genuine pioneering spirit where innovators and other brave souls are encouraged and supported.</p>
<p>Practice Four: I mplant a Multiplication Ethos from the Beginning I ntegrate into the very fabric of the community a sustained commitment to multiplication. The Chinese church did this through the saying, “Every person a church planter, every church a church-planting church.” What a great motto to arouse a multiplication philosophy! I mplant within the heart of your community a “go forth and multiply” ethos. In our experience, many churches will resist this, so leadership will need to work hard at getting community buy-in and commitment to multiply. (This theme is further developed in the chapter 6.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Recount the stories of amazing multiplication, like the early church</li>
</ul>
<p>and the church in China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage the entire community to read books like The Starfish</li>
</ul>
<p>and the Spider2 and The Tipping Point.3</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant a seed by asking, “How can we make church as simple and</li>
</ul>
<p>reproducible as possible?” This is a question that’s bound to stimulate a multiplication ethos along with numerous insightful ideas for the way ahead.</p>
<p>Practice Five: Provide a Framework to Dream and Plan In establishing an apostolic environment, the group needs a map to guide their dreaming and planning. These maps can take the form of a stepby-step process to guide the team in detailed preparation, or helpful theological concepts and language that provide a meaningful framework for planning. Sometimes these maps can be established beforehand, but in reality most of them will emerge “just in time,” or even in hindsight. This is helpful, as it will provide learning for future dreaming and planning. For an example of a framework that Darryn provided for the mission team he works with  in chapter 4. &#x3C; Proofer: this is the diagram about individual to corporate dreaming and the to contextual dreaming and practices and so on.</p>
<p>It is in the MI chapter.></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Habit 2: Cultivate Apostolic Genius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To cultivate an Apostolic Genius ethos, an appropriate culture and way of life need to be fashioned. We know that culture is predominantly shaped by the daily conversations, interactions, and practices of the group’s members.</p>
<p>It follows, then, that to cultivate an Apostolic Genius culture, we need to ensure the group’s practices, interactions, and conversations are of an apostolic nature.4 While all this sounds potentially complex, the practices are reasonably straightforward.</p>
<p>Practice One: Develop an Understanding of the Apostolic Genius Model The first practice we suggest in cultivating an Apostolic Genius ethos is to develop the group’s understanding of the Apostolic Genius framework.</p>
<p>Here are some ways we propose you can begin to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get as many people to read The Forgotten Ways text as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that this is a comprehensive text containing complex terminology and many new paradigm shifts in how we think about church and movements. The reason for this detail is to dislodge our thinking from the current forms that exercise a monopoly over our imaginations. It’s crucial we engage our minds and hearts in the quest to recover the forgotten ways of apostolic movements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop an understanding of change process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a significant role, particularly for leaders in established churches and organizations. It’s our belief that an established church can change and become missional, but leaders will need to have a clear perspective on the change process required to get this done. Don’t look for short-term solutions when the issues you deal with are complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Embed Apostolic Genius at the core of the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>In cultivating Apostolic Genius it’s helpful to implant the idea at the very heart of the group. If you’re a new church planter you can lay down this as the base DNA and get it right from the start. To do that you’ll need to make sure each of the members of your core team grapples with the ideas of Apostolic Genius. Much depends on what you build into the “stem cells” of the church. It is much better to get it right in the beginning. For those in established churches, you will need to work hard to dislodge the inherited imagination where it blocks Apostolic Genius.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Forgotten Ways provides us with a way of seeing movements in their wholeness. It is not a one-dimensional look at the characteristics of movements; rather, it describes an entire system of interconnected elements. Because Apostolic Genius is a system, it is critical that you keep your eye on the whole while focusing on any of the singular elements. Never lose sight of the fact that a true apostolic movement needs all six elements to flourish.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Common Missional Practices Essentially, missional practices are a set of agreed-upon practical commitments that guide a group in living out their dreams, identity, and values in ways consistent with their unique calling from God. Revisit the missional-incarnational impulse chapter (chapter 4) and outcomes from your conversations, as these will provide you with material to develop common, and sustainable, missional practices.</p>
<p>Fostering a set of common practices and way of life is an excellent way to act together as a missionary people, thus cultivating a robust apostolic consciousness in the process. This is why we suggest that all groups would benefit from forming a set of practices as a way to engage in mission in a collective and sustainable manner. In the process this will shift mission from a programmed activity to a common lifestyle which is vital for sustainability.</p>
<p>Practices also move a group’s values from preferred to actual and gives everyone in the community a clear framework of how they can contribute.</p>
<p>We think you’ll be surprised at how powerful this simple but profound practice can be.</p>
<p>The apostolic task here is to</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate the group about the importance of common practices.</li>
<li>Guide the collaborative process in developing them.</li>
<li>Provide a context for accountability.</li>
<li>Ensure the practices are connected with their unique calling.</li>
</ul>
<p>For examples of collective missionary practices, see the resource section at the end of this book.</p>
<p>Practice Three: Theological Reflection As a group reflects on how God works through his people across time to bring about his new creation, the community will be able to find itself as part of this unfolding redemptive story. It’s crucially important that as God’s people we read and explore scripture in this way as a living text. And even though the canon of scripture closed with Revelation, salvation history rolls on, and we can participate in it!</p>
<p>The continuous communication and discussion of mission-shaped theology should be done in many ways and in many contexts, both formally and informally. Just think creatively, and your community will come up with a host of ways to engage scripture.</p>
<p>Go to conferences together, get insightful talks on DVD, share important books and articles around the community, or invite a wellweathered incarnational practitioner to reflect on his or her missionary theology with your group. Set up the environment, and facilitate conversation around these themes. This process will shape and maintain the web of meaning that holds your mission community together. It will also offer your group new language and metaphors, as well as increased motivation.</p>
<p>For example, it is a requirement for all Third Place Communities stakeholders to attend at least one mission-related seminar annually and to read at least one missionary-themed book. Often the community will attend a conference together en masse. This has proven to be a helpful process in reflecting theologically together.</p>
<p>Practice Four: Retell Your Stories The stories of our past formed who we are, and the stories we recall each day continue to shape us. Retelling your stories is unquestionably one of the most constructive practices a community can adopt. This is how you explain your calling and mission to yourself as well as to new members.</p>
<p>Listening to one another retell stories from their experiences is how you step back and view your mission from afar. Remembering your stories will also allow you to discern where God has worked through you in the past. This will bring clarity for your future and remind you of your calling as a community.</p>
<p>Stories are inspiring. They provide energy, which often leads to action simply because it locates principle right in the heart of reality. Stories connect because they demand attention. People can easily find themselves within a story, which in turn allows possibility: “If God used Jeremy to do that, maybe He can use me as well?” We know of a mission community that hosts an annual dinner where they eat together and remember the stories of the past twelve months. This community also organizes a yearly weekend retreat for anyone interested in dreaming up the future. Asignificant portion of this weekend is spent recalling the stories of how and why they formed in the beginning.</p>
<p>Awise missional community will mine and treasure its stories. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with the leadership team, make a commitment to</li>
</ul>
<p>remember and retell your stories as each member intermingles with others in the church group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask people for their cherished memories of engaging in mission</li>
</ul>
<p>together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create slide shows. Apicture paints a thousand words! Obviously,</li>
</ul>
<p>you will need photos for this, so document your ministry with a camera. Take photos of all the people with whom you are connecting, and of the places you connect, the parties, the food, the celebrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>I nterview members for your newsletter. Ask them to talk about</li>
</ul>
<p>their favorite memories; get them to recall a story or two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Together, map how relationships began and developed. When did</li>
</ul>
<p>we meet John? Who met him first? How did it happen? Whom did he connect with next? Recall significant moments in your relationships.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asimple question like, “How has God used us in the past?” will</li>
</ul>
<p>lead to many interesting stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get someone to write a book that collects the stories of the</li>
</ul>
<p>community and retells them in a compelling manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice Five: Action–Reflection
Establish a practice of action–reflection within the mission community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you engage in mission together, make sure you put time aside to reflect and pray about it. It’s beneficial to do this through a formal process, as well as informally through the everyday conversations among the group’s members. Leaders will need to instigate and model the informal process themselves by incorporating reflection into the conversations they have with others in the community. Simply asking a fellow missionary how your shared mission of catching up with friends every week is going will do the trick. The informal practice is clear-cut: engage in mission, and then reflect and pray together.</p>
<p>It is important periodically to set aside a few days to reflect on the overall ministry direction and effectiveness. Weekend retreats are a great way to do this. Asimple SWOT 5 analysis can be helpful here. There are numerous other evaluation tools and programs available, so do a little research, and choose (or create) the one that best suits your context.</p>
<p>Practice Six: Preserve Mission as the Organizing Principle Part of the apostolic function is to create a missional organizational culture and then seek to ensure that the community remains true to it. Even for the most committed, action-oriented mission groups, the tendency will be to move away from mission and to become more inward-focused. As we have just mentioned under theological reflection, facilitating conversation around core missional theology will create the organizational culture and maintain the web of meaning and core purpose that holds the group together.</p>
<p>It’s a habit any group committed to missional church cannot afford to overlook.</p>
<p>Find ways to reawaken people to the gospel. One way Darryn has sought to do this in his community is through exploring distinct biblical themes that relate to the mission of God and the church. Take, for instance, the theme of shalom. The group has surveyed the subject through scripture, talked about it, dreamed of what it might look like in specific situations and contexts. This has also invigorated the group’s commitment to evangelism by providing them with new language and images in talking with those not of the faith about the gospel.</p>
<p>Asimple question you can ask to help preserve mDNA is, “Are we moving away from our primary calling as a missionary people?” If yes, you can ask further questions, such as “How?” and “Why?” and “What do we need to do in order to realign with our core purpose?” More often than not, the reason that people have moved away from their primary calling is busyness. In that case, the apostolic role is to seek ways to help integrate mission into the everyday rhythms of life. This way, as long as people are living, they will be engaging in mission. This is preserving the missionary DNA in theory and in action.</p>
<p>Practice Seven: Prayer Regular mission-focused prayer is a valuable practice in the task of implanting Apostolic Genius. What a community talks to God about powerfully shapes its ethos. Corporate prayer is an essential part of a community’s conversation and contributes to its culture, so keep mission at the fore of what you talk to God about when you are together. Prayer, among many benefits, directs our gaze toward God, the chief seeker of humanity.</p>
<p>Collective prayer helps us listen together to God and teaches us to be attentive to his movements. Bill Hybels was right: we need to be seekersensitive, and prayer helps us to be so—sensitive to God, the ultimate seeker.</p>
<p>Through regular mission-centered prayer, the community will be reminded that God is the source and energizer of mission.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaches us to pray for more evangelists, for a blessing on evangelistic activity, and for the salvation of those in our midst.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas you may wish to implement, but be creative and develop your own collective prayer habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize prayer walks around areas in which you spend time</li>
</ul>
<p>connecting with people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host prayer meetings specifically to pray for those with whom you</li>
</ul>
<p>are connecting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage each member to pray every day for the church’s</li>
</ul>
<p>mission and for the people with whom they are connecting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Habit 3: Foster Community Calling and Uniqueness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In creating an apostolic environment, it is beneficial for a group to harness their missionary identity and uniqueness. Remember that apostolic ministry calls forth the common identity and vocation of God’s people. Identity clearly relates to who a group is and its sense of purpose. A community’s uniqueness is directly related. It refers to the specific gifting and ability God invests in a particular group of his people. As these themes are intimately related, we will deal with them together.</p>
<p>Some have referred to this specific gifting as the group “charism,” taken from the Greek word charis, meaning “gift” or “grace.” We prefer the term uniqueness and will use that from here on. Agroup’s uniqueness, therefore, is the distinctive gifting God invests in a group of people. This communal gift is not a theological statement, but a deep-seated passion and intuition of why this group was called into being and the unique contribution they make to God’s mission. Once discovered, a group’s uniqueness will generate a clearer indication of a group’s identity and calling. Ashley Barker recommends that connecting with the reasons God brought a specific community into being helps current and future workers find the passion, purpose, and contributions they can make collectively.6 Apostolic leadership fosters the group’s identity and uniqueness and endeavors to align its way of life to match. Asimple way to do this is to carefully consider your uniqueness when forming your collective practices.</p>
<p>Practice One: Discover Your Uniqueness I nstigate a process to discern your group’s identity and uniqueness.</p>
<p>How can a group do that? The answer is straightforward, but the process requires patience and commitment. The way a group discovers its identity and uniqueness is simply through prayer and collaboration.</p>
<p>The importance of prayer can never be overstated. After all, the group’s uniqueness has been given by God, so asking how he has distinctively graced your group is more than a good idea—it’s crucial. So pray about it regularly.</p>
<p>By reflecting and collaborating on a series of insightful questions, the group will see their identity and gifting with more clarity. It’s essential to recruit others outside the group who know the mission well to also reflect on the following questions. Abalanced discernment process always includes wise and caring individuals who observe from a distance. Here is a list of questions that will help your group through this discernment process. Make sure you spend time on this; if you rush, you’ll just have to do it again.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why did God bring this group into being in the first place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the founding passions and dreams?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How has God worked through this group in the past?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the group’s current passions and dreams?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What’s the one thing this group does really well?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What unique contribution does this group make to the broader</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>mission of God?</p>
<h2>Urban Neighbors of Hope (UNOH)</h2>
<p>UNOH, a mission order among the poor, was inspired to take its founding experiences seriously. Ten years after UNOH formed, it embarked on a year-long journey to look deeper into where God had given its members passion and used them in the past. What they discovered was their founding uniqueness, simply stated, “to seek God’s reign among the lost and poor incarnationally, and to help urban neighbourhoods facing poverty become like Christ-centred villages.”7 At the end of the process, the UNOH founders concluded that by focusing on these questions they were touching afresh why God brought them into being and in the process were identifying, nurturing and valuing their founding uniqueness.8</p>
<h2>Third Place Communities</h2>
<p>TPC discovered their uniqueness was simply to be a missionary community within local third places. Their deep-seated intuition of why God called them into being was to locate themselves within third-place culture, engage in the social rhythms, and practice the presence of Christ. They identified their unique contribution as participation within this culture, a place where few Christians ventured with missionary intent. They communicate their uniqueness as “a mission of hospitality in third and first places.”9 They describe hospitality as creating an environment where people experience the character of God, where people feel they belong before they believe, and a context in which to explore their spirituality with freedom and creativity.</p>
<p>Habit 4: Develop Ministry Capacity In growing an apostolic environment, the community’s capacity for ministry must be continually increased. Apostolic influence develops the group’s ministry aptitude and fitness primarily through calling forth and developing the gifts, passions, and skills of God’s people. The best way to do this is to broaden the ministry base to include the fivefold forms of ministry outlined in Ephesians 4; apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers—or APEST, for short. The apostolic environment creates a setting where other ministries emerge and ministry capacity is maximized.</p>
<p>Practice One: Organize Community around APEST Ministry Apostolic influence develops ministry capacity largely through calling forth and developing the gifts. It is the foundational gift that provides both the environment and the reference point for the other ministries to flourish as described in Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>Encourage as many people in your community to complete an APEST profile analysis. This will highlight the primary gifts and calling for each person. (For an example of an online APEST profiling tool go to www. theforgottenways. org/apest/.) This is a great resource for communities and leadership teams, as it will allow you to work toward a more complete ministry mix. We also suggest you sign up for the 360-degree evaluation, which allows for a more balanced overview, because it involves others around you in the process. If you choose not to do the 360-degree evaluation, make sure that you talk about it together as a community and give feedback to one another. It’s a good idea to graph all the results, so you can see at glance the strengths and weaknesses of your group and areas for growth.</p>
<p>This will prove to be a valuable resource in evaluating and planning.</p>
<p>Mapping the Gifts Darryn and his mission group have mapped the results of their leadership team on Excel charts10. As a team they reflected on the results and hosted a retreat with their whole faith community to reflect how they are positioned as a group. During this time they reviewed their strengths and areas for growth, confirmed one another’s gifting, and prayed for one another’s development. They also brainstormed how to structure their missionary rhythms in reference to the distribution of the gifts and looked for ways to make room for one another to thrive. Why not try a similar process with your group?</p>
<p>Structuring the community around the fivefold ministry and developing a fully functioning APEST system will go a long way toward maturing an apostolic environment. Endeavor to arrange the community around APEST functions and ensure that all five areas are operational within the leadership group. Custom-build a system that suits your mission group. For instance, this is how South Melbourne Restoration Community reconceived itself around APEST ministries.</p>
<h2>Practice Two: Training</h2>
<p>To organize a community around APEST, people need to be trained and matured in these functions. This approach allows for a much richer and more biblical typology to inform leadership and ministry development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it allows us to equip the faith community for ministry in every way possible.</p>
<p>Be sure to employ an action–reflection education process based on discipleship processes (see chapter 3). We have discovered through ten years of training missionaries via the Forge Mission Training Network that an action–reflection process is one of the most effective models for missionary development. This process is explained under Habit 2 above (Cultivate Apostolic Genius) and is pretty straightforward—engage in missionary activity, provide a process for reflection and goal setting, and establish theological and missiological frameworks. Here are a few more hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an in-house internship process where people are developed</li>
</ul>
<p>in their gifting and calling, where they also learn theory and receive coaching.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide people with resource books, DVDs, articles, and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage people to attend conferences and workshops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage members to participate in other forms of action–</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>reflection training.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect people in context-based networks and learning</li>
</ul>
<p>communities such as Forge (Aus), Shapevine (global), Missio, Ecclesia Network, Epoch Center, Missional Training Network (Canada), Together in Mission (UK), Allelon, DAWN, etc.11</p>
<ul>
<li>Some members should look into formal seminary training, but we</li>
</ul>
<p>suggest that they take their time and share their insights with, and be held accountable to, their community.</p>
<p>Practice Three: Empower Empowerment is not something leaders magically give to others. People already have the power. It’s not a matter of granting it to them, but of cultivating an environment where they are free to exercise it. We must abandon command-and-control leadership and seek to provide a meaningful context in which people are inspired to exercise their God-given gifts and abilities. As Dee Hock suggests, “If you provide a framework of purpose and principle, people will know what to do in accordance with them, and they’ll do it in thousands of unimaginable and creative ways.”12 Apostolic leaders know that missionary coding runs deep within God’s people and thus seeks to unleash that potential through fashioning a culture where people are empowered into mission-focused ministry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate innate passions: What are people passionate about? Where</li>
</ul>
<p>does their energy lie? Clever mission groups will build mission around these passions and existing energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free up time: Don’t overprogram and expect people to commit to</li>
</ul>
<p>everything. Limit people’s involvement in self-focused in-house activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek to integrate life and mission: You have to eat, so why not eat</li>
</ul>
<p>with others? You need to exercise—invite others along. You have to shop for groceries, so make shopping missional. This empowers people to see mission as a way of life rather than as a program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask probing questions that stir people into action, such as “What</li>
</ul>
<p>was your greatest achievement this past month?” or “What do you wish you had more time for?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Defer dreaming to the whole group. I nitiate processes for</li>
</ul>
<p>collaborative dreaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage people to experiment with new ideas and approaches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Habit 5: Catalyze Apostolic influence seeks to link people, vision, and resources in order to extend Christianity. This is distinctively a catalytic function. Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom give the following example of catalytic influence.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Take nitrogen and hydrogen, two common elements, put them in a container,
shut the lid, come back in a day and see the result. Nothing changes. But, if
you add iron into the equation, you get ammonia. The interesting thing is that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iron remains unchanged in the container. It simply facilitates the bonding of these two elements. I ron therefore is a catalyst. It initiates a reaction between elements without fusing into that reaction.13 Likewise, catalytic influence in ministry facilitates a meaningful bond between people resulting in positive action. It’s an apostolic function in that it inspires people to synergize and work together for a common (kingdom) purpose. Please note that the catalyst function is in no way exclusive to leadership. In fact, there are many people at the grassroots level who operate this way instinctively when they link people together for positive action. The catalyst is the person who always seems to know someone who might help or add value to the task at hand.</p>
<p>As we suggest in the next chapter (on organic systems), this will require leaders to develop a relationally networked system rather than an institutional structure.</p>
<p>Practice One: I nitiate Vision and Ideas, Then Step Back Catalytic people are initiators, idea generators, and inspirers. They are full of new ideas that they allow others to take the responsibility for acting upon. They stay in the background, offering support but providing enough room for people to form and develop ideas in their own way. In many respects the apostles’ ministry described in the New Testament was catalytic, as the apostles (Paul in particular) connected people and initiated churches in many new regions.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Acatalyst could propose the following question and challenge to the community: “Wouldn’t it be great if we could gather a group of young, mission-hearted people to form as a missional band among their friends in the nightclub scene?” Through this simple question, the vision has been cast, the idea seeded, and the challenge issued. The next step is to wait and see where it finds energy. Occasionally, the catalyst can prod by asking people individually what they thought and how they felt when the idea was shared. In addition to initiating vision and new ideas, the catalyst makes connections among people and provides the essential resources.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Make Connections among People Catalytic people are not only initiators and idea generators; they are also facilitators and connectors. Brafman and Beckstrom note that if you put a group of people into a room, they might chat about the weather in random groups, but add a catalyst and they’ll soon be discussing something specific and purposeful.14 Through his or her very presence and example, a catalyst inspires people to connect and talk about things that matter. In a ministry sense, catalysts facilitate discussion and dreaming around participating in God’s missionary endeavor. This should happen both formally and informally.</p>
<p>Catalysts generally know a lot of people and make connections between individuals with similar direction and passions. They are always thinking, “Who might benefit from knowing whom?” To that end, they intuitively map whom they know, whom those people know, and how they relate to one another and fit into the broader scheme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Map connections. Discern the common links, dreams, and</li>
</ul>
<p>passions. Connect the dots between isolated pieces of information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring people together who have similar passions and callings. Get</li>
</ul>
<p>them sharing their ideas, experiences, and stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make connections between people’s dreams and the necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the chapter on the catalyst in The Starfish and the Spider, and</li>
</ul>
<p>discuss.</p>
<ul>
<li>For more examples on connecting people, please see the</li>
</ul>
<p>networking habit in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Brafman and Beckstrom in their book The Starfish and the Spider provide the following table to distinguish the unique difference between a CEO and a catalyst.15 We find it helpful in thinking about the different ways to influence. For more information, we recommend reading their chapter on the catalyst.</p>
