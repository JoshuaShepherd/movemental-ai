<p>Strange Attractors In living systems theory there exists a phenomenon called the "strange attractor." Essentially, strange attractors are that force, analogous to a compass, or an animal’s deep instinct, which orients a living system in one particular direction and provides organisms with the impetus to migrate out of their comfort zone.2 They are found in all living systems, including human organizations. As has been discussed in the chapter on chaos theory, a system that is in equilibrium is inevitably in decline and to become adaptive needs to move toward the edge of chaos to initiate its latent capacity to adapt and therefore survive. As in biological systems, the role of the strange attractor in organizations as living systems is therefore critical to the ability of the organization to survive an adaptive challenge..
