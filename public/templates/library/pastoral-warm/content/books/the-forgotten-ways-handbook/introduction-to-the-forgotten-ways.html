<h1>Introduction to the Forgotten Ways</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by force. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.</p>

<p>Before delving into the details of practicing the forgotten ways, it's important to take an overview of the core ideas. Some of you will have read The Forgotten Ways and will be familiar with the key information. For this purpose simply insert the original as a refresher for those that have read it. It goes like this...</p>

<p>Imagine there was a power which lies hidden at the very heart of God's people. Suppose this power was built into the initiating ‘stem cell’ of the church by the Holy Spirit but was buried and lost through centuries of neglect and disuse. Imagine that if rediscovered, this hidden power could unleash remarkable energies that could propel Christianity well into the twenty-second century. Is this not something that we who love God and his cause would give just about anything to recover? The idea of latent inbuilt missional potencies is not a mere fantasy; in fact there are primal forces that lie latent in every Jesus community and in every true believer. Not only does such a thing exist but it is a clearly identifiable phenomenon that has energized history’s most outstanding Jesus movements, perhaps the most remarkable expression of which is very much with us today. This extraordinary power is being recovered in certain expressions of Western Christianity, but not without significant challenge to, and resistance from, the current way in which we do things.</p>
<p>The fact that you have started reading this book will mean that not only are you interested in the search for a more authentic expression of ecclesia (the NT word for church), but you are in some sense aware of the dramatic changes in worldview that has been taking place in general culture over the last fifty years. Whatever one may call it, this shift from the modern to the post-modern, or from solid modernity to liquid modernity, has generally been difficult for the church to accept. We find ourselves lost in a perplexing global jungle where our well used cultural and theological maps don’t seem to fit. It seems we have woken up to find ourselves in contact with a strange and unexpected reality that seems to defy our usual ways of dealing with issues of the church and its mission. All this amounts to a kind of ecclesial future-shock where we left wandering in a world we can no longer recognize. In the struggle to grasp our new reality, churches and church leaders have become painfully aware that our inherited concepts, our language, indeed our whole way of thinking are inadequate to describe what is going on both in and around us. The problems raised in such a situation are not merely intellectual ones but together amount to an intense spiritual, emotional and, existential crisis.</p>
<p>The truth is that the twenty-first century is turning out to be a highly complex phenomenon where terrorism, technological innovation, an unsustainable environment, rampant consumerism, and discontinuous change confront us at every point. In the face of this, even the most confident among us in our more honest moments would have to admit that the church as we know it faces a very significant adaptive challenge. The overwhelming majority of church leadership today report that they feel it is getting much harder for their communities to negotiate the complexities before them. And as a result the church is on massive, long-trended, decline in the West. In this situation, we have to ask ourselves probing questions, "Will more of the same do the trick? Do we have the inherited resources to deal with this situation? Can we simply rework the tried and true Christendom understanding of church which we so love and understand, and finally, in an ultimate tweak of the system, come up with the winning formula?” 1 If we are honest, it seems that the inherited formulas simply won’t work anymore. And there are many others who think this way. There is a massive roaming of the mind going on in our day as the search for alternatives heats up. However, most of the new thinking as it relates to the future of Christianity in the West only highlights our dilemma and generally proposes solutions that are little more than revisions of past approaches and techniques. Even much of the thinking about the so-called Emerging Church leaves the prevailing assumptions of church and mission intact and simply focuses on the issue of theology and spirituality in a post-modern setting.</p>
<p>This amounts to reworking the theological “software” whilst ignoring the “hardware” as well as “operating system” of the church. In my opinion this will not be enough to get us through. As we anxiously gaze into the future and delve back into our history and traditions to retrieve missiological tools from the Christendom toolbox, many of us are left with the sinking feeling that this is simply not going to work. The tools and techniques that fitted previous eras of Western history simply don’t seem to work any longer.</p>
<p>What we need now is a new set of tools. Anew “paradigm”—a new vision of reality: a fundamental change in our thoughts, perceptions, and values, especially as they relate to our view of the church and mission.</p>
<p>And it’s not that reaching into our past is not part of the solution. It is.</p>
<p>The issue is that we generally don’t go back far enough; or rather, that we don’t delve deep enough for our answers. Every now and again we do get glimpses of an answer, but because of the radical and disturbing nature of the remedy we retreat to the safety of the familiar and the controllable. The real answers, if we have the courage to search for and apply them, are usually more radical than we are normally given to think, and because of this they undermine our sense of place in the world with its status quo—not something that the Western church has generally been too comfortable with. But we are now living in a time when only a solution that that goes to the very roots of what it means to be Jesus’ people will do.</p>
<p>The conditions facing us in the twenty-first century not only pose a threat to our existence but also present us with an extraordinary opportunity to discover ourselves in a way that orients us to this complex challenge in ways that are resonant with an ancient energy. This energy not only links us with the powerful impulses of the original church, but also gives us wings with which to fly. The Forgotten Ways primary text could be labeled under the somewhat technical category of missional ecclesiology, because it explores the nature of the Christian movements, and the church as it is shaped by Jesus and his mission. But don’t be fooled by the drab terminology—missional ecclesiology is dynamite. Mainly because the church (the ecclesia), when true to its calling, and on about what God is on about, is by far the most potent force for transformational change the world has seen. The Forgotten Ways was written in the hope that the church in the West can, by the power of the Holy Spirit, arouse and reengage that amazing power that lies within us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with a Single Question</p>
<p>In 2003 I attended a seminar on missional church where the speaker asked a question. "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100, before Constantine came on the scene, say, AD 310?"2 Here is the somewhat startling answer:</p>
<p>AD 100: As few as 25,000 Christians</p>
<p>He then asked the question which has haunted me to this day, "How did they grow from twenty-five thousand to become such a significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?" Now this question led me to the discovery of what I will call Apostolic Genius—the inbuilt life force of the church, and the elements that make it up. These components I have tagged missional DNA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let me ask you the question—how did the early Christians do it? And before you respond, here are some qualifications you must factor into your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They were an illegal religion throughout this period: At best, they were tolerated; at the very worst they were very severely persecuted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They didn't have any church buildings as we know them: While archaeologists have discovered chapels dating from this period, they were definite exceptions to the rule and they tended to be very small converted houses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They didn't even have the Scriptures as we know them: They were putting the canon together during this period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They didn't have an institution or the professional form of leadership normally associated with it. At times of relative calm, prototypical elements of institution did appear, but by what we consider institutional, these were at best pre-institutional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They didn't have seeker sensitive services, youth groups, worship bands, seminaries, or commentaries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They actually made it hard to join the church. By the late second century aspiring converts had to undergo a significant initiation period to prove they were worthy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact they had none of the things we would ordinarily employ to solve the problems of the church, and yet they grew from twenty-five thousand to twenty million in two hundred years! So, how did the early church do it? In answering this question lies the key to understanding the nature of the church and mission in our day and in our context. For herein lies the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But before the example of the Early Christian Movement can be dismissed as a freak of history, there is another perhaps even more astounding manifestation of Apostolic Genius,3 that unique and explosive power inherent in all of God’s people, in our own time—namely, the underground church in China. Theirs is a truly remarkable story: About the time when Mao Zedong took power and initiated the systemic purge of religion from society; the church in China which was well established and largely modelled on Western forms due to colonization, was estimated to number about two million adherents. As part of the this systematic persecution, Mao banished all foreign missionaries and ministers, nationalized all church property, killed all the senior leaders, either killed or imprisoned all second and third level leaders, banned all public meetings of Christians with the threat of death or torture, and then proceeded to perpetrate one of the cruellest persecutions of Christians on historical record.</p>
<p>The explicit aim of the Cultural Revolution was to obliterate Christianity (and all religion) from China. At the end of the reign of Mao and his system in the late 70’s, and the subsequent lifting of the so called Bamboo Curtain in the early 80’s, foreign missionaries and church officials were allowed back into the country, albeit under strict supervision. They expected to find the church decimated and the disciples a weak and battered people. On the contrary, they discovered that Christianity had flourished beyond all imagination. The estimates then were about 60 million Christians in China, and counting! And it has grown significantly since then. David Aikman, former Beijing bureau chief for Time magazine, suggests in his book Jesus in Beijing that Christians may number as many as 80 million.4 If anything, in the Chinese phenomenon, we are witnessing the most significant transformational Christian movement in the history of the church. And remember, not unlike the early church these people had very few Bibles (at times they shared only one page to a house church and then swapped that page with another house group.) They had no professional clergy, no official leadership structures, no central organization, no mass meetings, and yet they grew like mad. How is this possible? How did they do it?5 But we can observe similar growth patterns in other historical movements, Steve Addison6 notes that by the end of John Wesley’s lifetime one in thirty English men and women had become Methodists. In 1776 less than 2% of Americans were Methodists. By 1850, the movement claimed the allegiance of 34% of the population. How did they do it?</p>
<p>These are dangerous stories because they subvert us into a journey that will call us to more radical expression of Christianity than the one we currently experience. It was the central task of The Forgotten Ways to give a name to these phenomena and attempt to identify the elements which constitute it. The phenomenon present in these dangerous stories I call Apostolic Genius and the elements that make it up I have named mDNA.</p>
<p>They will be defined fully later. The object of The Forgotten Ways is to explore Apostolic Genius and try to interpret it for our own missional context and situation in the West. These two key examples (the Early Church and the Chinese Church) have been chosen not only because they are truly remarkable movements, but also because one is ancient and the other contemporary and so we can observe Apostolic Genius in two radically different contexts. I have also chosen them because both movements faced significant threats to their survival; in both cases this took the form of systematic persecution. This is significant because as will explained later, the church in the West faces its own form of adaptive challenge as we negotiate the complexities of the twenty-first century—one that threatens our very survival.</p>
<p>Persecution drove both the early Christian movement and the Chinese church to discover their truest nature as an apostolic people. Persecution forced them away from any possible reliance on any form of centralized religious institution and caused them to live closer to, and more consistently with, their primal message, namely the gospel. We have to assume that if one is willing to die for being a follower of Jesus then in all likelihood that person is a real believer. This persecution, under the sovereignty of God, acted as a means to keep these movements true to their faith and reliant on God—it purified them from the dross and any other unnecessary churchly paraphernalia. It was by being true to the gospel that they unleashed the power of Apostolic Genius. And this is a huge lesson for us: as we face our own challenges we will need to be sure about our faith and who it is in which we trust or else risk the eventual demise of Christianity as a religious force in Western history—witness Europe in the last hundred years.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the answer to that question, the question of how these phenomenal Jesus-movements actually did it, I have become convinced that the power that manifested itself in the dangerous stories of these two remarkable movements, is available to us as well. And the awakening of that dormant potential has something to do with the strange mixture of the passionate love of God, prayer, and incarnational practice. Add to this mix, appropriate modes of leadership (as expressed in Ephesians 4), the recovery of radical discipleship, relevant forms of organization and structures, and the suitable conditions for these to be able to catalyze. When these factors come together, the situation is ripe for something remarkable to take place.</p>
<p>To nail down this rather elusive concept of dormant (or latent) potentials, recall the story of The Wizard of Oz. The central character in this well-loved movie is Dorothy, who was transported in a tornado from Kansas to the magical Land of Oz. Wanting to return home, she gets guidance from Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, who advises her to walk to the Emerald City and there consult the Wizard. On the yellow brick road she acquires three companions: the Scarecrow, who hopes the Wizard will be able to give him some brains; the Tin Woodsman, who wants the Wizard to give him a heart; and the Lion, who hopes to obtain courage. After surviving some dangerous encounters with the Wicked Witch of the West and numerous other nasty creatures, they eventually make it to see the Wizard, only to find out he is a hoax. They leave the Emerald City broken hearted.</p>
<p>But the Wicked Witch, perceiving the magic in Dorothy’s ruby slippers, won’t leave them alone. After a final encounter with the Wicked Witch and her minions, they overcome the source of evil and thereby liberate Oz. But through all their ordeals and in their final victory they discover that in fact they already have what they were looking for—in fact they had it all along.</p>
<p>The Scarecrow is very clever, the Tinman has real heart, and the Lion turns out to be very brave and courageous after all. They didn’t need the Wizard at all. What they needed was a situation that forced them to discover, or activate that which was already in them. They had what they were looking for, only they didn’t realize it. To cap it off, Dorothy had her answer to her wish all along; she had the capacity to return home to Kansas—in her ruby slippers. By clicking them together three times, she is transported back to her home in Kansas.</p>
<p>This story highlights the central assumption here and gives a hint to why it has been called The Forgotten Ways: namely, that all God’s people carry within themselves the same potencies that energized the early Christian movement and the Chinese church. Apostolic Genius lies dormant in you, me, and every local church that seeks to follow Jesus faithfully in any time.</p>
<p>We have quite simply forgotten how to access and trigger it.</p>
<h2>A Sneak Preview</h2>
<p>Here is where the rubber hits the road. This is the heart of the book as it attempts to describe Apostolic Genius and the constituent elements of mDNA that make it blaze up. Einstein said that when the solution is simple, God is speaking. Following this advice, I have tried to discern quintessential elements that combine to create Apostolic Genius and to simplify them to the absolutely irreducible components. There are six simple but interrelating elements of mDNA, forming a complex and living structure. These present us with a powerful paradigm grid with which we will be able to assess our current understandings and experiences of church and mission. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Lord</strong>: At the center and circumference of every significant Jesus movement resides a very simple confession. Simple, but one that fully vibrates with the primal energies of the scriptural faith, namely, the claim of One God over every aspect of every life, and the response of his people to that claim (Deut. 6:4–6ff). The way that this was expressed in the New Testament and later movements was simply "Jesus Is Lord!" With this simple confession they changed the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disciple-Making</strong>: Essentially this involves the irreplaceable, and lifelong, task of becoming like Jesus by embodying his message. This is perhaps where many of our efforts fail. Disciple-making is an irreplaceable core task of the church and needs to be structured into every church's basic formula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missional-Incarnational Impulse</strong>: This refers to the twin impulses of remarkable missional movements. Namely the dynamic outward thrust and the related deepening impulse which together seed and embed the gospel into different cultures and people groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apostolic Environment</strong>: This refers to apostolic influence and the fertile environment it creates in initiating and maintaining the phenomenal movements of God. This will relate to the type of leadership and ministry required to sustain metabolic growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organic Systems</strong>: This relates to the idea of appropriate structures for metabolic growth. Phenomenal Jesus movements grow precisely because they do not have centralized institutions to block growth through control. Here we will find that remarkable Jesus movements have the feel of a movement, structure as a network, and spread like viruses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communitas not Community</strong>: The most vigorous forms of community are those that come together in the context of a shared ordeal. Communitas emerges from communities who define themselves as a group with a mission that lies beyond them, thus initiating a risky journey. Everyone loves an adventure. Or do we?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apostolic Genius is the phrase I developed to try to name the unique energy and force that pulsates through the remarkable Jesus movements in history. My own conclusions are that Apostolic Genius is made up of six components, or elements, called mDNA. These six elements are briefly described above. Loaded into the term Apostolic Genius is the full combination of all the elements of mDNA that together form a system, as it were, each informing and impacting the other. As already stated, Apostolic is latent, or embedded, into the very nature of God’s gospel people. I suggest that when all the elements of mDNA are present and are in dynamic relationship with the other elements, and an adaptive challenge acts as a catalyst, then Apostolic Genius is activated.</p>
<p>And so the system of Apostolic Genius will look something like this....</p>
<p>Suffice to say here that in exploring these ideas I feel that I am peering into things that are very deep, things that, if recovered and applied, could have considerable ramifications for Western Christianity. I say this as someone who is not claiming something as my own. If anything, like all who receive a grace from God, I feel that I am the humble recipient of a revelation, an unearthing of something primal, in which I am privileged to participate. The Forgotten Ways is a stumbling attempt to articulate that ever elusive revelation of the nature of Apostolic Genius—something that belongs to the gospel itself and therefore to the whole people who live by it. Albert Einstein said that when he was peering into the mysteries of the atom he felt he was peering over God’s shoulder into things remarkable and wonderful. I must admit to feeling the same sense of awe as I look into these things.</p>
