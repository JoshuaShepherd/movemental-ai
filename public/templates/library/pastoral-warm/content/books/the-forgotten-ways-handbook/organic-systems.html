<h1>Organic Systems</h1>
<p>In this chapter we’ll explore the next element in mDNA, the inner structures that embody Apostolic Genius and enable organic, exponential, movement-type growth. This chapter will include habits that revolve around developing a movement ethos, structuring as a network, cultivating viruslike growth, and looking at multiplication principles and processes.</p>
<h2>The Church as a Living System</h2>
<p>Organic descriptions of the church abound in scripture. Images such as body, field, yeast, seeds, trees, and vines are plentiful. These images are not simply metaphors that help us describe a theological truth but actually indicate the way the kingdom operates. When Jesus says “the kingdom of God is like...,” he is actually describing the operational principles of kingdom growth. We can therefore look to creation for clues to how God himself intended human life, community, and church to manifest. Having rediscovered the potency of organic systems, we will then need to reappropriate them in the church, in order to reposition us for the challenges and complexities facing us in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Followers of Jesus who seek to base their communal life in organic ways find in scripture, as well as in creation, a rich theological resource to fund and sustain it. This is also true for the church. An organic image of church and mission is theologically richer by far than any mechanistic and institutional conceptions of church that we might devise. This is because it is supported by a sense of God’s intimate relation and investment in his creation.</p>
<p>An organic, or living systems, approach seeks to structure the common life of an organization around the rhythms and structures that mirror life itself. In this approach we can probe the nature of life and observe how living things organize themselves. From there we can try to emulate as closely as possible this innate capacity of living systems to develop high levels of organization and adapt to varying conditions. Relating a living systems approach to church connects with the idea that every group of God’s people has everything within them needed to adapt and thrive in any setting.</p>
<h2>A Movement Ethos</h2>
<p>But organic systems are not only about the church “greening” its perspectives on organization. They are also about movement dynamics. To recover the missional vitality of the early church, we have to reawaken a movement ethos in our organizations. Most churches have lost any remnant of the type of ethos they had when they started or when their denominations were founded. This is because along the way networks developed into organizations, and organizations developed into institutions. Institutions develop incrementally and are set up to maintain a certain expression by developing rites, rituals, a professional ministry class, buildings, creeds, etc. and to pass them on to succeeding generations. The intentions are usually very sincere, but the net effect often results in a controlling, high-conformity culture that tends to reject efforts to disturb the status quo. Thus, renewal is a difficult process, fraught with the possibility of failure. We do believe that in the end, institutionalization is to some extent inevitable, but we also think it can be held at bay if we are clever about it. Maintaining a movement ethos is one sure antidote to the dangers of increasing institutionalism.</p>
<p>In critiquing religious institutionalism, we are not saying that we don’t need some form of structure to maintain healthy spiritual life in the church.</p>
<p>We do. But there is a world of difference between organizational structure and religious institution. We must remember that structure cannot create life, although without it life cannot exist very long. To maintain a movement ethos we need to keep structures as simple as possible and make sure they are easily reproducible.</p>
<p>We can contrast the differences between institutionalized religion and a movement ethos in the following table.</p>
<p>INSERT TABLE ON PG. 196 IN TFW Please note that there is a typo in the table in TFW – column 1 line 6 should be “to be” rather than “be to”.</p>
<h2>Networked Structures</h2>
<p>If Apostolic Genius develops organically and expresses itself in a movement ethos, then it forms itself around a network structure. This is very different from what we have come to expect from our general concept of church.</p>
<p>Peter Ward uses the term “liquid church” to describe what a truly networked church would look like—a church responsive to the increasingly fluid dimension of our culture. He contrasts liquid church with what he calls “solid church.” In his terminology, solid church is roughly equivalent to what is here described as “institutional church.” And solid church has generally mutated from its original basis as a movement into either (1) communities of heritage (that embody the inherited tradition), (2) communities of refuge (a safe place from the world), or (3) communities of nostalgia (living in past successes).</p>
<p>The alternative is liquid, or networked, church. Networks structure very differently. For one, they are decentralized and are comprised of many different nodes (or agents) in the system. These could be individuals, cells, or organizations. They relate to one another on the basis of relationships and common cause, and not through centralized organization. Therefore, the effective performance of a network over time will depend to a large degree on the cultivation of shared beliefs, principles, interests, and goals. As shocking as it seems at first, it is not hard to see the striking similarities between the structures of terrorist networks like Al-Qaeda and that of the early church. While the agenda for each is entirely different, it is partly the structure that makes both so effective and just about impossible to “take out.”</p>
<h2>Viruslike Growth</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting elements of organic systems is their innate capacity to reproduce, thus allowing for rapid multiplication when conditions are ideal. When applied to the church, rapid multiplication empowers mission and releases movements. The great missiologist Roland Allen called this innate capacity within God’s people “the spontaneous expansion of the church.” The gospel, like all great ideas, is spread just like a virus. It captures us, and when we are infected, we in turn go on to “infect” others in our relational networks. We can therefore say that in many ways the gospel is “sneezed” and then passed on through further sneezing from one person to another.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and Reproducibility</h2>
<p>One more thing needs to be noted before we conclude this section, and that is the related issues of reproduction and reproducibility. All organic life seeks to reproduce and perpetuate itself through reproduction, not cloning. This distinction is significant, because many approaches to church planting tend to be more consistent with cloning than reproduction. The result is that of merely duplicating the original model or system from which it came. The trouble is that the problems of the prevailing system are simply imported into the new church without serious reflection.</p>
<p>Reproducibility relates to the capacity of living systems to multiply through simple, reproducible mechanisms. It needs to be embedded in the organic system to ensure that mission will perpetuate. If we are to recover latent Apostolic Genius in the West, then like the Chinese church we must ask ourselves, “What is the irreducible minimum of the faith? What is too complex to reproduce?” We too need to eliminate the things that don’t matter. Simplicity is a vital key to multiplication and to spontaneous expansion.</p>
<p>Complex attractional approaches tend to have a contraceptive effect on the reproductive capacities of the church. They can stifle genuine people movements, because effective attractional church requires a professional concept of ministry with a lot of resources. This must sound a clear warning to us as we attempt to negotiate the missional challenges of the twenty-first century. We need to get it right from the start—in the stem cell of the church, so to speak.</p>
<p>When organic systems meet a genuine movement ethos that expresses itself in networked structures, if given the right conditions for reproducibility, then history is in the making. If you’d like to further explore the theory of organic systems, please read chapter 7, as well as the addendum in The Forgotten Ways.</p>
<p>Now let us consider specific habits and practices that help form and release organic systems.</p>
<h2>Suggested Habits and Practices</h2>
<p>Remarkable Jesus movements have the feel of a movement and the structure of an organic network, and they spread like viruses. If we wish to follow in the footsteps of these movements, we must find a pattern of church closer to life itself. In doing this, we suggest the following four habits to awaken and sustain organic growth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stir up movement</li>
<li>Structure organically</li>
<li>Network and communicate extensively</li>
<li>Sneeze the gospel</li>
</ol>
<h2>Habit 1: Stir Up Movement</h2>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Chinese church was truly activated in a powerful way only when all institutional reference points were forcibly removed.1 To recover the missional vitality of the remarkable Jesus movements, we have to reawaken a movement ethos.</p>
<p>Practice One: Change How You Think about the Church If we wish to arouse a movement ethos, we must change the way we think about the church. Start to think and talk about the church as a movement rather than as a centralized organization. Seek to awaken the image of Christianity as a movement of disciples whose calling is to “sneeze” the gospel into every imaginable context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate the group about the nature, flow, and dynamics of</li>
</ul>
<p>movements. Agreat book to read together is The Starfish and the Spider. It’s insightful, reasonably short, and very easy to read.</p>
<p>Read it together, and then begin to discuss the implications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t think about church planting, rather think about “movement</li>
</ul>
<p>planting.” The reason behind this is to begin with the end in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose the group to stories of dynamic movements. The early</li>
</ul>
<p>church is a great place to start. You will also find numerous examples in The Starfish and the Spider, and also in The Tipping Point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulate stories and examples of influential movements, both</li>
</ul>
<p>current and past. Study the Celtic movement, and then translate the applicable principles to your situation.2</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubt always characterizes decline when it comes to</li>
</ul>
<p>organizational life cycles. You will need to deal with ideological/theological doubt as it arises.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Start to Behave like a Movement Stirring a movement ethos will require a change in behavior. We not only have to start thinking about the church as a movement, but also need to start behaving like one. Movements are fluid, adaptive, and open to risks, and almost always begin in the grass roots of society. Maybe that’s a good place to start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradually seek to transform the vision from an organization to a</li>
</ul>
<p>movement focus. If you name yourselves as a movement, you will begin to act like one, so start there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consciously begin to structure organically (see habit 2 in this</li>
</ul>
<p>chapter).</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a culture of permission to dream and try new things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experiment with new mission groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it a covenantal requirement for every church or group within</li>
</ul>
<p>your mission to multiply regularly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore numerous change management processes. You might find</li>
</ul>
<p>one that suits your group perfectly, or you may have to pick and choose from a number of them. A good example of change management process is outlined by Alan Roxburgh and Fred Romanuk in their book The Missional Leader.3</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian Associates International</li>
</ul>
<p>CAI is a grassroots movement in Europe.4 In 1999 they set a long-range goal to identify and develop 500 missionaries sent out to establish one or more missional churches in fifty major cities in Europe by 2010—and they are well on the way to achieving this. By explicitly adopting a movement ethos, CAI sees its core task as initiating a chain reaction of church-planting movements.</p>
<p>As they see it, a church-planting movement is characterized by habitual church planting. To instill this ethos they’ve adopted the following four processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiating: the process of starting a new church community</li>
<li>Establishing: the process of community development</li>
<li>Maturing: the process of growing depth in community</li>
<li>Reproducing: the church planting process within a church</li>
</ul>
<p>community.</p>
<p>What is absolutely critical to their thinking is the central importance of generating a grassroots movement. This they see as critical for the re-evangelization of post-Christian Europe.5</p>
<h2>Habit 2: Structure Organically</h2>
<p>All living systems require structure and organization to maintain their existence. An organic approach seeks to structure the common life of a group around the rhythms of life itself. At the heart of organic structure, we find a network of meaningful relationships that unites the whole system. Structure exists to support life, not to obstruct it. So when it starts to inhibit growth, it should be reviewed and modified. The structures need to be simple, reproducible, and internal. When approaching organic structure, think farmer, not CEO; think gardener, not technician.</p>
<p>Practice One: Distribute Power and Function The role of leadership and the structure it sets in place is to distribute power and function outward in the system (as opposed to centralizing it.) It must cultivate equity, self-sufficiency, and individual opportunity. An organic system recognizes that every member has intelligence and knowhow and aims to identify, foster, and unleash that resource. In living systems theory, this is called distributed intelligence; it is spread throughout the organization and can be found at every level. It’s essential that each person in the network is empowered to perform according to their gifting and interests. Think of Paul’s teachings on the body of Christ in this regard.</p>
<p>In commenting on organic structure, Dee Hock of VISA Corporation advises that the governing structure must not be a chain of command, but a framework for dialogue, deliberation, and coordination among equals. He suggests power and function must be dispersed to the maximum degree, that participation must be open to all connected parties, and that decisions should be made by groups and methods representing all parties, yet dominated by none.6</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than leaders setting direction and making decisions, seek a</li>
</ul>
<p>more community-wide process where all contribute to the issue at hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to involve all stakeholders in making decisions. Stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>must wear their decisions. If someone is in a decision-making level and doesn’t have to live with the consequences of the decision, he or she is not a true stakeholder. Stakeholders are generally those people who have a vested interest in the ministry and have demonstrated that through their actions, devotion, and resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>To distribute function, organize the community around individual</li>
</ul>
<p>passions and gifts. For more detail on this, see chapter 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute intelligence by making room in your meetings and other</li>
</ul>
<p>forums for people to share their ideas and findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage ownership and responsibility. This happens largely</li>
</ul>
<p>through involvement in the ministry, as well as through being a part of the dreaming and decision-making processes. For more information, see the collaboration practice under Networking, below (habit 3).</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize regular times when people can contribute to the dreaming</li>
</ul>
<p>and planning.</p>
<p>An Example of Distributing Power</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For six years the founding group from TPC met as a
leadership team twice per month to review and plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While these meetings were open to others for their information and input, most regarded this group as the central guiding and decision-making body. The result is that it actually disempowered people to take ownership and participate. After a thorough review of their processes, TPC reworked their structures into a more organic form. Leadership is no longer positional but relational—influence is exercised through relationship and spiritual authority, rather than through an official position. Everyone is involved in brainstorming and planning, and decisions are made by the key stakeholders. They have replaced the team meetings with monthly collaboration and dreaming gatherings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice Two: Become a Learning Organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alearning organization is one in which people at all levels, individually and collectively, are continually increasing their capacity to produce results.7 It’s an organization with an inbuilt philosophy for expecting and responding to change, complexity, and uncertainty. To remain adaptive, we must constantly push the boundaries of our own understanding and knowledge. And we must share and interpret this information throughout the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage those in your community who are avid readers and</li>
</ul>
<p>researchers to share their findings and expand the community with their knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply accurate and meaningful information, and focus the</li>
</ul>
<p>community around it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Empower the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers</li>
</ul>
<p>instruct the whole group about their specific area of ministry.</p>
<p>You could make it the focus of a five-month community-wide theme—one month to explore the theory and practice of each area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell the problem before the solution. Always put the problem to the</li>
</ul>
<p>people as the first step, then sit down together and brainstorm a way forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a sister community with whom you can covenant to share</li>
</ul>
<p>knowledge and findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Become part of a broader network (see networking habit below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Readjust or disband teams as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribute DVDs, books, articles, new research, and other helpful</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>material.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt to bring meaning, interpretation, and wholeness—rather</li>
</ul>
<p>than order—to chaos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that an action–reflection approach is critical to</li>
</ul>
<p>learning.</p>
<p>Practice Three: Structure around Life and Existing Energy Instead of trying to fit each new person, in all their diversity, into a rigid framework, seek to build structure around people’s passions, energy, and lifestyles. Aim to build church and mission around people in their context, not the other way around. This means structuring the life of the organization around the life of the people, around the natural ebb and flow of life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build community and mission around existing energy and</li>
</ul>
<p>lifestyles. If there’s a group in your church who love to surf, then structure church and mission around them at the beaches and other connected social hubs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find what people are into, what gives them energy, what they</li>
</ul>
<p>spend their time doing, and explore opportunities to frame church and mission around them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your gathering (church service) times and frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>carefully. Do they inhibit or promote connection with the broader community you are hoping to reach? Is the time when your church gathers the same time when the host community gathers socially?</p>
<ul>
<li>When you notice new energy in your group, poke it, see what</li>
</ul>
<p>makes it tick, and explore ways to support it. Many leaders are intimidated by this, especially if the new energy didn’t start with them. Leaders, it’s not about you—so get over it and sponsor new grassroots energy and initiatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be brave and disband groups and ministries that no longer have</li>
</ul>
<p>life in them. If just a few key people constantly have to prop it up, then maybe it’s time to put it to bed. Do regular assessments of all groups in the church on this basis.</p>
<p>Practice Four: Shared Belief and Purpose Networks are held together in a web of meaningful relationships formed around shared belief and purpose. The effective performance of a network will depend on the cultivation of relationships around these two elements. As Dee Hock says: All organizations are merely conceptual embodiments of a very old, very basic idea—the idea of community. They can be no more or less than the sum of the beliefs of the people drawn to them; of their character, judgments, acts, and efforts. An organization's success has enormously more to do with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles and strength of belief in them than to assets, expertise, operating ability, or management competence, important as they may be.8 A community shaped by a sense of common belief and purpose is better than any number of assets or skills. The key is to nurture comradeship around a united belief and sense of purpose in Jesus. This becomes the foundation on which to structure everything else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend significant time forming a set of common values, beliefs,</li>
</ul>
<p>practices, etc., as already suggested in various elements of mDNA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help new people become familiar with the values, beliefs, and</li>
</ul>
<p>particular calling of the group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host weekend retreats where the story of how and why the</li>
</ul>
<p>ministry began is shared. Use a variety of means to do this: dialogue, story, photos, video, and so on. You can use this environment as a springboard to dream and imagine the future together.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim to distill your identity, purpose, and way of life down to the</li>
</ul>
<p>simplest language possible. It has to be clear and memorable for it to be meaningful and embodied. An effective way to do this is through identifying your unique calling and establishing a set of simple missional practices to suit.</p>
<ul>
<li>TPC initially developed a set of twelve practices to guide them in</li>
</ul>
<p>living out their calling. They were reasonably straightforward, but there were too many, and they were far too detailed. They weren’t easy to remember and definitely were not conversational. Afew years later TPC reworked them into a simple list of three practices phrased as one question,9 to make it easy to remember and talk about. In hindsight this made all the difference for people beginning to live them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor and encourage one another regularly. Host a meal where</li>
</ul>
<p>you focus the conversation on what you appreciate about the other people in the room. Share what excites you about them, where you see godly traits at work, what they’ve taught you, the gifts you notice in them, and so on. Use these times to confirm the gifts and value God has invested in them. If you do this often enough, it will become a habit! This will promote shared belief and purpose.</p>
<p>Exercise in Evaluating Structures and Processes</p>
<ol>
<li>One at a time, evaluate all your structures and</li>
</ol>
<p>processes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What are their strengths and weaknesses?</li>
<li>On a scale of 1–10, do they support or inhibit</li>
</ol>
<p>community, ministry, and mission?</p>
<p>(1 = strongly inhibit, 10 = strongly support. Be ruthless with anything below 5.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What structures can be reworked? How would you do</li>
</ol>
<p>it?</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What structures need to replaced? What are some</li>
</ol>
<p>suggestions for new structures? Do you need to wipe the slate clean and start again? (This could be a viable option; if so, don’t be afraid to do it. If you choose this path, make sure you move at a pace set by the community, and be sure to collaborate at all levels.) TPC: An Example of Structuring Organically</p>
<h2>Third Place Communities structures their community in the following way:</h2>
<p>Households: These comprise the basic gathering of church. Households meet anywhere—homes, parks, cafés, and they can meet any time. The smaller unit of community gives space for genuine friendships and discipleship to take place. All households meet three times per month and in their own unique way express the values and purposes of TPC. Households are usually no bigger than twenty people.</p>
<p>Tribe: The Tribe is the collection of all TPC households and gathers formally once per month. The Tribe also connects and engages informally through shared projects, proximity in third places, and general life rhythms.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram below, the sun symbolizes the core mission and DNA—their identity and ethos. This is what binds them together and is found in every group. The circles represent the principal unit of church (the households), while the arrows signify the multichannel relational networking among the churches.</p>
<p>(TPC is also connected to a broader network of missional communities from around the country, which are not pictured in the diagram. This takes place through events, personal visits, e-mail, and phone. This is understood to be the Clan—the family of Tribes.) The Household, the Tribe, and the Clan; they are simple to run and easy to reproduce—most people can do it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Habit 3: Network and Communicate Extensively</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Networking and communication are crucial for organic systems to thrive. Anetwork is a collection of independent people and groups who act autonomously but link across boundaries to work together for a common purpose. The task of leadership is to bring the various elements in the system into meaningful communication and relationship. This will require the leader to focus on developing a relationally networked system rather than an institutional structure for the church.</p>
<p>Practice One: Develop Kingdom Synergy Akey characteristic of missional churches is that they develop meaningful connections beyond the local church. In God’s economy the simple but profound reality is that we are much better working together than apart. The problem is that our organizational default tends to focus us on the needs of our own group, and we miss out on the many benefits of networking with others. The beauty about networking is that the outcome is often greater than the sum of the parts. When diverse gifts and knowledge rub up against each other, new forms of knowledge and possibilities arise. This is kingdom synergy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a large pool of missional practitioners and communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These colleagues will prove to be valuable allies. Locate them, recognize and honor their good ideas and habits, swap findings, and seek to learn from one another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before making new plans, look around to see if anyone else in the</li>
</ul>
<p>broader network is doing something similar to what you hope to achieve. Don’t reinvent the wheel if you can legitimately collaborate with and learn from others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Combine your resources and train people together. That might</li>
</ul>
<p>mean cooperating on a series of workshops or intensives or may even equate to an in-depth internship-style program. But remember not to totally outsource the training function, or you will eventually lose the capacity to train locally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Host regular network days and workshops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a resource bank and make it available across the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize a retreat with another missional group. Hanging out</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>together over a weekend sharing food, life, and stories is an effective way to inspire and energize both groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have communion together often. At the heart of this practice is the</li>
</ul>
<p>recognition that Jesus is in our midst and that we are united and brought together through him.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Ensure Flow of Information The free flow of information is vital for the health and growth of a network. Leaders of networks don’t withhold information to use as power; they share it widely and use it to empower. That’s a big difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Church newsletters and calendars are significant communication</li>
</ul>
<p>tools for sharing new information and updating people on what’s happening around the traps. Take pride in this communiqué; don’t just slap it together in a few minutes. It’s a core informationsharing tool for your group.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you gather, have significant time set aside for people to</li>
</ul>
<p>share.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly send out articles through e-mail, and point people to</li>
</ul>
<p>Web sites and other important resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about and promote books for people to read. Maybe review</li>
</ul>
<p>and recommend a book each month. Start a book club where people read the book of the month and then catch up for a chat and coffee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide details: we must empower people to communicate with</li>
</ul>
<p>each other individually and as a whole group. To do this, people will need each other’s contact details. Provide access to a database with such details, including e-mail lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide communication tools: if people are going to communicate</li>
</ul>
<p>with one another, they will need the means to do so. Set up an Internet group so people can communicate with one another simply and easily. Social utility Web sites such as Facebook are great for this. It’s simple to set up your own group. Anyone can upload information, messages, links to Web sites, resources, photos, and videos. Members can easily message one another individually or send a message to the whole group without typing addresses.</p>
<p>Myspace, Bebo, Orkut, hi5, and many other social networking sites provide similar services, all for free.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could also develop a group on shapevine. com and use the</li>
</ul>
<p>video conferencing features. Shapevine is dedicated to the development of decentralized Christian networks and education.</p>
<p>Information Flow at VISA “The greatest delight from all my days leading Visa, were open staff meetings, from which we never wavered.</p>
<p>Within a day after every board meeting, staff meetings were held to include every employee of the company at every level including the newest. They were conducted by the most senior person present. At the meeting, every decision of the board was fully disclosed. Every employee was free to ask any question about the decisions, or anything else of concern to them. Their questions were answered fully. ‘That’s confidential’ was not considered an answer. ‘I don’t know but I will find out and tell you at the next meeting’ was permissible, but only if the promise was faithfully kept.”10 (Dee Hock, Founder of the VISA company)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice Three: Collaborate and Dream Together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defer idea generation to the whole church community as much as possible. When you need fresh ideas, or wish to discover a new way forward, or begin to plan for a new mission initiative, include everyone in the process.</p>
<p>Don’t simply brainstorm as a small team, but extend the task to the crowd. It will foster ownership, and in the end you will receive a higher quality of ideas than if you just did it among yourselves. As a team, don’t plan everything, but rather seek to awaken the dream and ideas from others. Smart missional leaders will work out how to tap into this resource and unleash the genius from within.</p>
<p>The function of leadership here is to set the context for collaboration.</p>
<p>The next step is to interpret what the group is saying and communicate it back to them in a meaningful framework consistent with the group’s calling.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions to stir your group’s missionary imagination:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is God preparing us for? How can we play our part in</li>
</ul>
<p>expanding God’s mission?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can we multiply our communities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would our host community look like with God at the core?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is God already at work in the community around us? How</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>can we join God in what he’s doing?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is good news for the people and culture we’re connecting</li>

<p>How Google Creates New Ideas Agreat example of this process is found in the way Google generates new ideas. All workers are encouraged to post new ideas on the Google intranet. Periodically, everyone gets the chance to review and vote for their favorite ideas. The top ideas are given time and resources for development and, hopefully, implementation. The person who dreamed up the idea is given time off their regular work to develop their idea with a small team.</p>
<p>What a brilliant ethos! Imagine if every church did this in relation to new mission.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here is a simple exercise that can be done with your</li>

<p>community or leadership team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw on three bits of paper three images or phrases</li>
</ul>
<p>that illustrate your dream for mission as you imagine it three years from now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share those dreams in pairs.</li>
<li>Ask each pair to choose two of their six dreams to</li>
</ul>
<p>bring to the larger group and place on a board.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the dreams are all posted, cluster the dreams into</li>
</ul>
<p>themes, and give one title per cluster.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each person then picks the cluster they resonate with</li>
</ul>
<p>most.</p>
<ul>
<li>Working in small groups, flesh out the dreams and</li>
</ul>
<p>brainstorm into actionable steps.</p>
<p>Practice Four: Always Seek a Win-Win Outcome Healthy networks are built on the idea of win-win alliances. The outcomes from this approach are synergistic in that they are mutually beneficial. Win-win is a belief based on the idea that there is often a third alternative. Character, relationship, respect, and appreciation are the foundations of win-win. We have found Stephen Covey’s Seven Habits very helpful in training people in this approach, particularly the three social habits.11</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Covey’s Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, especially</li>
</ul>
<p>the social habits. Discuss these and consider how they enhance a networking ethos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate these meaningfully into your church and organizational</li>
</ul>
<p>life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget self-promotion. Do what you can to help others succeed in</li>
</ul>
<p>mission.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the other options; win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, and win.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are helpful alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>See the issue from another point of view. Seek first to understand,</li>
</ul>
<p>then to be understood.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the key issues and concerns involved.</p>
</li>

<h2>Habit 4: Sneeze the Gospel</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful elements of organic systems is the innate capacity to reproduce spontaneously and exponentially. The habit, “sneezing the gospel,” in essence is focused on the church’s ability to create an environment where the gospel and witnessing community grows naturally and swiftly.</p>
<p>The gospel itself is a very powerful idea that can spread just like a virus if the conditions are right. The rapid and spontaneous growth of the early church is testament to this fact. The setting was just right; there was a common language, a predominant culture, and, thanks to the Romans, extensive infrastructure. Not to mention a widespread spiritual hunger brought about by the meaninglessness of paganism. As people freely traveled around the known world, the gospel was “sneezed” and passed on through further sneezing from one person to another. From twenty-five thousand to twenty million in two hundred years, that’s epidemic! We suggest that sneezing the gospel is enhanced when we aim for simplexity, release early and often, and aim for viruslike growth. These are the three practices we recommend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice One: Aim for Simplexity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term simplexity is taken from the realm of biology, where it brings together two key ideas that are critical to organic systems—namely, simplicity and complexity. What occurs in movements is the capacity to distill a message to its core while at the same time retaining both its original meaning and depth. “Jesus is Lord” is one such example. It captures a complex idea of monotheism in one simple, three-word confession. This is not only sneezable, but also profoundly transformative.</p>
<p>To sneeze the gospel, both the message and message community must be easily and rapidly transferred. The motto here is simple to get, simple to spread. Remember that when Paul goes into Thessalonica, he is kicked out nine days later, and he can write two letters to them and call them a church.</p>
<p>In the West, we have complicated and intellectualized the gospel. The problem is that the more complex the message, the slower the possibility of quick adoption. We need to learn again from the phenomenal movements of history. Until we do so, exponential growth will evade us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distill the gospel to its most pure and simple. What are the core</li>
</ul>
<p>essentials, its irreducible minimum? Make sure you connect this with the existential need of people you are trying to reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to refine our ideas until they are thoroughly “sneezable”</li>
</ul>
<p>by anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The same is true for the organizational ethos. Develop simple ways</li>
</ul>
<p>of expressing the ideas that describe as well as mobilize the church. In this way it becomes sneezable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make church as simple and reproducible as possible. Keep each</li>
</ul>
<p>core unit of church small and simple to run, easy to duplicate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid clutter, people have enough already: shed all that does not</li>
</ul>
<p>matter.</p>
<p>Practice Two: Release Early and Often This phrase, taken from the software development world, is the idea that underlies the release of beta versions of software. By releasing software before it is fully completed, the programmers receive significant feedback from users and add it to the solution to create a better product. Likewise, we suggest that you encourage innovation and experimentation, but that you don’t wait for the perfect plan. People will learn on the way in the place of action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a culture of feedback from all stakeholders. Learn from</li>
</ul>
<p>mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly research new areas for mission. Get as many people in</li>
</ul>
<p>your groups as possible to be involved in this. Don’t just leave it to leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continually recruit and prepare new teams as suggested in the</li>
</ul>
<p>chapter on apostolic environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically gather together all the mission bands across your</li>
</ul>
<p>community (or network) for mutual learning, reflection, and encouragement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistently equip and energize all mission groups. Remember</li>
</ul>
<p>that they are the heroes and ought to feel deeply valued by leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build new expressions of church around new believers. Don’t</li>
</ul>
<p>absorb them all into one community. Each group should be taught basic missionary skills of contextualizing gospel and community.</p>
<p>Remember, they are not necessarily running large organizations but rather simple churches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build new mission around people’s passions, gifts, and lifestyles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice Three: Aim for Viruslike Growth In setting up an organic system to enhance the church’s reproductive capacity, we are essentially aiming for spontaneous, viruslike growth. The gospel should be simple to get and simple to pass on, just like a virus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the movie Pay It Forward and discuss the principles</li>
</ul>
<p>involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be persistent. All ideas that have gone viral were persistent to the</li>
</ul>
<p>point of hitting a critical mass, after which the idea moved to spontaneous growth. But be careful not to bug people to the point of annoyance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think and pray carefully about the initial host community you</li>
</ul>
<p>befriend. Are they open to your group and core values? Do you already have significant connections there? Is this host group well connected and networked? Will they introduce you to others in the community (recall the “person of peace” concept of Luke 10).</p>
<ul>
<li>As we have suggested, keep the core components of church simple,</li>
</ul>
<p>reproducible and small. Keeping the core unit of church small increases your surface area, providing increased proximity and offering the host community numerous connection points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine if everyone in your community took a multiplication</li>
</ul>
<p>approach to mission. Consider the following exercise: Assume you have twenty-five members.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each person covenants to bring five people to Jesus in a ten-year period. Include a commitment to disciple and challenge them to do the same (five people each).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s say this cycle was repeated five times in ten years, just</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>once every two years. The outcome would be 78,215 new disciples. Not bad for twenty-five people!</p>
<ul>
<li>Now imagine that every church covenanted to do the same, to</li>
</ul>
<p>plant five churches every ten years. And then those churches took the challenge and started another five... and so the cycle goes.</p>
<p>The Starfish and the Spider Spiders are creatures with eight legs coming out of a central body, and if you look closely, you will see a spider also has a head with eight eyes. If you chop off the spider’s head, it dies. It could possibly survive without a leg or two but certainly wouldn’t survive without its head. At first glance, a starfish looks similar to a spider. Like the spider, the starfish appears to have a bunch of legs coming out of a central body. But that’s where the similarities end. The starfish doesn’t have a head, and its central body is not in charge. In fact, the major organs are replicated throughout each and every arm. If you cut the starfish in half, it won’t die; instead, you’ll have two starfish to deal with. Some varieties can replicate from just a single piece of arm. They can achieve this magical regeneration because a starfish is basically a network of cells, with everything it needs to reproduce spread throughout the entire body.12</p>
<h2>The Tipping Point</h2>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell, in his book The Tipping Point,, highlights the mechanisms by which some ideas achieve popularity while others fade into oblivion. He unveils a number of similar patterns at play in nearly every influential trend. Gladwell identifies three key factors that determine whether a trend will tip into wide-scale popularity.13 While we know that the gospel is far more than an idea, these findings highlight the elements that amplify the flow of ideas. We found this helpful as a template for reflecting on our own local ministry; we hope you do as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Law of the Few</li>
</ol>
<p>Success is largely dependent on the involvement of people with a distinct and rare set of social skills. To attain widespread popularity, a few key people must champion an idea before it can reach the tipping point. They are known as connectors, mavens, and salesmen. The aim is to identify and use these people types in getting an idea off the ground.</p>
<p>Connectors are people who link us with other people. They are individuals who know lots of people and have ties in many different social contexts. Connectors act as conduits between people, helping create connections and relationships. You know these people. They are those with apostolic, hospitality, evangelistic, pastoral, and serving traits.</p>
<p>Mavens are those we rely upon to connect us with new information. They accumulate knowledge, know how to share it with others, and have a strong compulsion to help people make informed decisions. You know these folk as well. They are people with gifts of wisdom, knowledge, prophecy, faith, discernment, and teaching, Salesmen are persuaders, who have a noticeable quality that goes beyond what they say, influencing others to want to agree and join with them. These are predominantly the evangelists, prophets, teachers, and apostles in your midst.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Stickiness Factor</li>
</ol>
<p>This refers to the unique quality that compels an idea to “stick” and influence new behavior. It is often counterintuitive to popular wisdom and inspires people to pay close attention. Stickiness is hard to define, and its presence or absence often relies heavily on context. What helps the gospel stick? Incarnating the gospel in life and community, credibility, personal testimony, acts of generosity and kindness, hospitality, extravagant love for the world and its inhabitants, to mention a few.</p>
<p>Six Principles for stickiness:14</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplicity. "To strip an idea down to its</li>
</ol>
<p>core, we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short is not the mission—sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound" (16).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Unexpectedness. “We need to violate</li>
</ol>
<p>people’s expectations. We need to be counterintuitive.” “We can use surprise—an emotion whose function is to increase alertness and cause focus—to grab people's attention.” “For our idea to endure, we must generate interest and curiosity” (116).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Concreteness. “We must explain our ideas</li>
</ol>
<p>in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information.” “In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: ‘Abird in hand is worth two in the bush’” (17).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Credibility. “Sticky ideas have to carry</li>
</ol>
<p>their own credentials. We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves....” Ronald Reagan asked, “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago” (17).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Emotions. “How do we get people to care</li>
</ol>
<p>about our ideas? We make them feel something.” “We are wired to feel things for people, not for abstractions. Sometimes the hard part is finding the right emotion to harness” (17–18).</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Stories. “How do we get people to act on</li>
</ol>
<p>our ideas? We tell stories.” “Hearing stories acts as a kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively” (18).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Power of Context</li>
</ol>
<p>If the environment or historical moment in which an idea is introduced is not right, it’s not as likely to spread.</p>
<p>While a variety of complex factors and variables play a role in sparking a trend, it’s often a few small but influential changes in an environment that allow these factors to tip. Think John 4, and the Samaritan Woman at the well. That very interaction with one person tipped the town of Sychar into belief. In fact, Jesus pointed to the power of context and timing when he said, in verse 35, “... open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.” When conditions are right, receptivity to the idea will be high. If receptivity is not high, then work on the conditions, not the idea.</p>
