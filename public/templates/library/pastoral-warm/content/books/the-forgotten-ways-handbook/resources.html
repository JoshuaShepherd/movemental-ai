<h2>Examples of Discipleship Norms</h2>
<p>Mosaic: At Mosaic in Los Angeles, they have arranged their minimum standard for those considering involvement into four basic areas of commitment.1</p>
<ul>
<li>A Holy Life</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a pledge to life transformation. They acknowledge that everyone is imperfect but that together they will strive to live holy lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participation in Ministry</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a commitment to move beyond being a spectator. The minimum level is to meet with others for worship, be involved in a small group, and find a place of service that utilizes individual gifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tithing</li>
</ul>
<p>Every person who feels a part of Mosaic is asked to be a generous giver and tithe 10 percent of their income or more.</p>
<ul>
<li>An Evangelistic Lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>People commit to using their unique gifts and personalities to build meaningful relationships with those who don’t know Christ and help others come to faith.</p>
<p>InnerCHANGE: Amissional order dedicated to incarnating the gospel among poor communities, InnerCHANGE upholds its minimum discipleship norms with the following six commitments:2</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Humility</li>
</ul>
<p>Acommitment to seek to imitate the humility of Christ, who emptied himself and became a servant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Simplicity</li>
</ul>
<p>Acommitment to an income and lifestyle that allow each missionary to live incarnationally with the poor. Adedication to temperance in all things, and to giving joyfully and generously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Purity</li>
</ul>
<p>Acommitment to honesty, transparency, and fidelity in all relationships.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Acommitment to compassion for the poor in words and action, to share the good news of eternal salvation, and to establish relevant expressions of Christ's kingdom among them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Community</li>
</ul>
<p>Acommitment to support fellow team members in prayer, love, and reconciliation, to express one’s gifts as a complement to one’s team members, and to love and encourage as they work to develop and use theirs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Prayer</li>
</ul>
<p>In recognizing that prayer is ministry, a commitment to stillness before God, to listening before speaking, and to meditating upon God’s word.</p>
<p>Examples of Community Mission Practices Third Place Communities When we think about our lifestyle and practices as a missionary community, we consider how God, the prime missionary, has acted throughout history. We acknowledge that God is always active in fulfilling his promise to re-create and make all things new. God is always brewing something within, among, and around us. We therefore ask “What is God brewing within, amongst, and around us?” and make the following promises: Context Promises Practices Examples Within TRANSFORM Regular engagement with scripture reading, reflection, lectio, to become more journaling, meditation like Jesus Daily conversation with God examen, journaling, contemplation, confession, listening, fasting Action–reflection training participate and contribute, internship, coaching, books, DVDs, seminars, intensives Giving financially to TPC mission posture of giving, yearly pledge Amongst PARTICIPATE gathering weekly with others in TPC household, tribe, social, in Christian collective expression community Encouragement and accountability learning together, prayer, communion, small gatherings, confession Shared mission pub, courtyard, third place rhythms, social events, community projects Multiplying our communities continually identifying and developing potential for growth, starting new households, and mission Around CONTRIBUTE Daily acts of generosity and kindness with our things, skills, to the world by time and money, joining God in welcoming strangers his missionary Weekly acts of hospitality &#x26; eating, drinking, partying, venture celebration third place rhythms, riteof-passage celebrations Regular meaningful engagement sharing our faith, ongoing conversations, exploring issues, deepening relationships Care for the world pursuing justice and mercy, care for creation As you can see, these three commitments or promises begin with the letters of their name, TPC—an easy way to remember what is normative for the community. Accountability occurs by asking one simple question with three parts: “What is God brewing within, amongst, and around?” This question is asked at all levels from personal interactions, within small groups, and also in the larger gatherings.</p>
<p>Small Boat Big Sea Small Boat Big Sea, a mission community located in the northern beaches of Sydney, has developed a simple order to its communal life, abbreviated with the acronym BELLS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bless: We will bless at least one other member of our community</li>
</ul>
<p>every day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat: We will eat with other members of our community at least</li>
</ul>
<p>three times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen: we will commit ourselves weekly to listening to the</li>
</ul>
<p>promptings of God in our lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn: We will read from the Gospels each week and remain</li>
</ul>
<p>diligent in learning more about Jesus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent: We will see our daily life as an expression of our sent-ness</li>
</ul>
<p>by God into this world.</p>
<p>Red emerged from South Melbourne Restoration Community, which Alan led for many years. The community has recently reorganized itself into a network of missional gatherings across Melbourne, Australia. Each group in the network has covenanted to uphold a few simple common practices, which are summarized under the heading TEMPT3 and constitute a way of expressing the values that lie at the heart of their movement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Together we follow</li>
</ul>
<p>“We commit ourselves as the people of God to live an authentic expression of Christian community.” We realize that we are called to walk the journey of discipleship with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement with Scripture</li>
</ul>
<p>“We commit ourselves to constantly engage with the Holy Scripture, recognizing that it is our handbook for life.” We choose to let the Bible interpret us. We recognize that the bible is God’s word and we are committed to its study. We recognize that the Bible is a book designed to be read in community</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission</li>
</ul>
<p>“We commit ourselves to join with God in his missionary endeavor to grow the Kingdom by sharing our faith, multiplying our communities, and welcoming strangers.” We believe that God’s heart aches to be in relationship with His lost creation; therefore, we as his people feel compelled to communicate this love through our words and deeds, by bringing justice, showing mercy, and communicating the Gospel, with the world around us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passion for Jesus</li>
</ul>
<p>“We commit ourselves to passionately reach out to Jesus as we respond to his love for us.” We have experienced the radical love of Jesus, and this fuels a passion within us to live out as his disciples in our everyday lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>“We commit ourselves to walk the road of discipleship together and to become more like Jesus every day.” We are all called to follow Jesus and to strive towards growing more like the people he wants us to be. In a world of consumerism and self-interest we choose a different path. We chose to die to self in order to find true life in Jesus.</p>

<h2>Example of mDNA Assessment</h2>
<p>The following table is an example of matching habits and their related practices with the mDNA matrix. The aim of this exercise is to determine the mDNA elements each habit and practice activates. For example, the habit Organizing Community around APEST activates all six elements, while Meaningful Engagement hits only five of the six. This is a simple way to match your habits and practices with the corresponding mDNA elements, thus allowing you to assess weaknesses and strengths and to work toward streamlining your activity.</p>
<p>Use this as a template to create your own chart on computer, cardboard, whiteboard, or whatever is most practical. List the various habits and practices common to your church in the left-hand column, then as a group discuss and check the elements you think are activated when you engage in that particular practice. This process can be done prior to choosing a set of habits and practices or after you have been practicing them for a while. The goal is to incorporate habits and practices that activate as many of the mDNA elements as possible.</p>

<p>The Six Thinking Hats of Edward de Bono</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The six hats represent six modes of thinking and are directions to think rather than labels for thinking. That is, the hats are used proactively rather than reactively. The method promotes fuller input from more people. In de Bono's words, it “separates ego from performance.” Everyone is able to contribute to the exploration without denting egos, as they are just using the yellow hat or red hat (or whatever hat). The six-hats system encourages performance rather than ego defense. People can contribute under any hat, even though they initially support the opposite view. The key point is that a hat is a direction to think, rather than a label for thinking.</p>
<ol>
<li>White Hat: Think of white paper. It’s neutral and carries</li>
</ol>
<p>information. The White Hat has to do with data and information. The White Hat asks what information we have here. What information is missing? What information would we like to have? How are we going to get that information?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Red Hat: Think of red and fire and warmth. This has to do with</li>
</ol>
<p>feelings, intuition, hunches, and emotions. “Putting on my red hat, this is what I feel: __________.” “My gut feeling is __________.” “My intuition tells me prices will soon fall.”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Black Hat: Think of the stern judge wearing black robes who comes</li>
</ol>
<p>down heavily on wrongdoers. This is the caution hat. Prevents us from making mistakes, making decisions hastily, doing silly things, illegal things, etc. It points out why something cannot be done or why something will not work.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Yellow Hat: Think of sunshine. The yellow hat is for optimism and</li>
</ol>
<p>the positive view. This looks for feasibility and how something can be done. It looks for benefits—but they must be logically based.</p>
<p>“That might work if we/I __________.”</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Green Hat: Think of vegetation and rich growth. The green hat is for</li>
</ol>
<p>creative thinking, for new ideas, additional alternatives, putting forward possibilities and hypotheses. This requires creative effort.</p>
<p>“We need some new ideas here.” “Are there any alternatives? Don’t worry how bizarre they might sound at first.” “Could we do this differently?” “Could there be another explanation?”</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Blue Hat: Think of the sky and an overview. This is for process</li>
</ol>
<p>control. The Blue Hat thinks about the thinking being used. It sets the agenda for thinking. It suggests the next step in the thinking. The blue hat can ask for other hats. It asks for summaries, conclusions, and decisions. It can make comments when you have it on: “Could we summarize how far we have got?” “I think we should look at the priorities.” “I suggest we try some more green-hat thinking now.” This is usually for the chairperson or organizer of the meeting.</p>

<p>Vital Online Resources for the Application of The Forgotten Ways mPULSE. This online test is designed to help identify and ‘measure’ the presence of Apostolic Genius (comprised of the six elements of mDNA) in your church. mPULSE (missional pulse) is designed to take the pulse of churches adopting the movement style approach to church and mission described in The Forgotten Ways. It will help in both assessing the ‘missionality’ of the organization, as well as provide a strategic tool for the development of Apostolic Genius as you apply the model. Do it once a year to take the pulse of your church/organization. Go to www. theforgottenways. org/mpulse APEST test: Similarly, in order to fully develop a missional type ministry in your church and/or organization, we have developed the online APEST test.</p>
<p>This allows you and your team to assess (and develop) Ephesians 4:11 ministry in your midst. There are both individual tests as well as 360o feedback tests to identify where each individual is located within the APEST profile. Go to www. theforgottenways. org/apest You can also engage in blog conversations with Alan and others on www. theforgottenways. org</p>
