<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>About four years prior to releasing the first edition I attended a seminar on missional church where in making a point the speaker asked a question: "How many Christians do you think there were in the year AD 100?" He then asked: "And how many do you think there were when Constantine came on the scene, say, AD 310?"2 Here are the somewhat surprising answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD 100: as few as 25,000 Christians</li>
<li>AD 310: up to 20,000,000 Christians</li>
</ul>
<p>He then asked the question that has haunted me to this day: "How do you account for the fact that a tiny, persecuted Jewish sect became the most significant religious force in the Roman Empire in two centuries?"</p>
<p>It was as if God was calling me to dedicate myself to finding the answer. It was a quest to understanding what it is that could produce such amazing growth and impact. I wanted to apply my findings for the church in any other time and place, including of course the twenty-first century. I totally dedicated myself to the task. This quest led me to discover a generative system that undergirds all genuine, highly transformative expressions
