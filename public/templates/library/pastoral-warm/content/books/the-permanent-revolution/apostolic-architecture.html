<h1>Apostolic Architecture</h1>
<p>This outsourcing of learning to institutions and professionals has a double impact: the impact on the so-called laity is that it discourages use of their own capacities to think and theologize for themselves.</p>
<p>Serious theologizing (that is, reflecting on God), intrinsic to discipleship itself, is thus outsourced to professionals.</p>
<p>It creates a needy dependence on the clergy, which produces intellectual apathy in the so-called laity. (Ironically, this is something the clergy complain about all the time.) Stated more bluntly, the system itself, the one they steward, perpetuate, and defend, nurtures the very thing that they bemoan.</p>
<p>In all these reflections, we do well to remember the profound words of Roland Allen when he reflected on the apostolic movements—what he rather poetically called "the spontaneous expansion of the church": The spontaneous expansion of the Church reduced to its element is a very simple thing.</p>
<p>It asks for no elaborate organization, no large finances, no great numbers of paid missionaries.</p>
<p>In its beginning it may be the work of one man, and that a man neither learned in the things of this world, nor rich in the wealth of this world....</p>
<p>The organization of a little church on the apostolic model is also extremely simple, and the most illiterate converts can use it, and the poorest are sufficiently wealthy to maintain it No one, then, who feels within himself the call of Christ to embark on such a path as this need say, I am too ignorant, I am too inexperienced, I have too little influence, or I have not sufficient resources.</p>
<p>The first apostles of Christ were in the eyes of the world “unlearned and ignorant” men: it was not until the Church had endured a persecution and had grown largely in numbers that Christ called a learned man to be His apostle.31 On a more disturbing and personal note, and one that has serious implications for the whole Christian information system from publishing to seminaries, I (Alan) remember Chinese underground church researcher Curtis Sergeant once challenging me about this.</p>
<p>In the West, he told me, we seek to become experts in order to “sell” our knowledge for mainly economic reasons—we thereby try to make ourselves indispensable—linchpins who intentionally create dependency.</p>
<p>We do not give our knowledge away freely because that is our means of income and the source of our value proposition to churches and Christian organizations.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a legitimate form of income, but it becomes problematic precisely at the point where it impedes the capacity of Jesus’s ecclesia to grow and mature.</p>
<p>Sergeant noted, and I believe rightly, that apostolic movements give knowledge away and would never think of attaching a dollar value to it.</p>
<p>The original apostles were not consultants and did not seek to create dependencies based on their specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>From an apostolic point of view, biblical truth belongs to the people of God, and we, if anything, are simply its stewards.</p>
<p>This sounds a clear warning to all those (including the two of us) who consider ourselves educators, knowledge workers, consultants, and authors who try to make ourselves indispensable to the transfer of essential information.</p>
<p>We must 242 the permanent revolution ask ourselves if we are creating unnatural dependencies or are empowering God’s people to live into their own truths.</p>
<p>There are existing models of education and training that are more consistent with discipleship approaches and apostolic bias than the ones we now have.</p>
<p>We must find a way to make them more the norm in leadership and spiritual formation.</p>
<p>Placing theological reflection back in the local ecclesia itself is a good step in the right direction.</p>
<p>And if we do not have models that suit, leadership should seek to produce them.</p>
<p>We can, and must, design and innovate our way out of the current training morass if we are committed to being more movemental. A Balance in the Force Planting the gospel and thinking in terms of movements as opposed to planting churches are good ways of conceiving the processes, or foundations, involved in architecting movements.</p>
<p>But the process needs to be bolstered by frameworks if they are to find expression.</p>
<p>Frameworks imply structure, and indeed some form of structure and organization is needed.</p>
<p>We suggest that one of the useful ways of structuring for movements is to develop what has been called sodalic, or sometimes apostolic, groupings or bands.</p>
<p>Movements attempt to harness the energies of all their members, but they also discover ways to release the potential of their most committed workers for the benefit of the wider movement.</p>
<p>The role of this more select group of people is to act as the pioneers of the movement going into previously unreached fields, as well as the consolidators who strengthen existing gains.</p>
<p>Jesus mobilized the masses, but the driving heart of his movement consisted of the twelve apostles and the seventy-two disciples sent out by the Lord (Luke 10:1).</p>
<p>Patrick intuitively understood this principle as did the later Catholic religious orders, the Moravians, the Methodists with their circuit riders, the Protestant missionary societies, and the Salvation Army.32 Ralph Winter has argued that God’s redemptive mission has been advanced by two complementary but distinct structures.</p>
<p>He describes these redemptive structures as modalities and sodalities: “A modality is a structured fellowship in which there is no distinction of sex or age, while a sodality is a structured fellowship in which membership involves an adult second decision beyond modality membership and is limited by either age or sex or marital status” (Table 11.2).33 Most local churches fit into the modality definition.</p>
<p>They are structured to be home grown, evangelistic, and discipling agencies.</p>
<p>Commitment to Christ is the basic requirement for membership, and only the most serious of offenses result in expulsion.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, most of the churches apostolic architecture 243 that received letters fit this description.</p>
<p>In contrast, Paul’s missionary band (comprising up to thirty people, including Titus, Timothy, and Barnabas) could be described as a sodality or task-oriented mission structure.</p>
<p>Inclusion was not automatic; a second adult decision was required to join the band.</p>
<p>Not only commitment to Christ but continued commitment to the purpose and standards of the group was required of members.</p>
<p>It is tempting to see Paul (as well as the other apostles) as doing it all alone, but clearly this is wrong.</p>
<p>Like all the other ministries, apostles saw themselves as extensions of the ministry of Christ and his body, the ecclesia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they seldom, if ever, operated without others around them.</p>
<p>Although Paul is often placed in the spotlight when it comes to the gospel spreading throughout the Mediterranean, a close reading of the text indicates that he did not work alone: he had anywhere from thirtyfive to ninety-five coworkers who, with different levels of regularity, were involved in his apostolic ministry.34 He most definitely had an organization with various levels of involvement and stakeholding.</p>
<p>Whether you call them coworkers, fellow-soldiers, or just plain teammates, Paul had a mosaic of partnerships with people who aided him in his apostolic The church local The church in mission form Diocesan, parish form Task oriented, selective focus Structured primarily for nurture and care Mobile, flexible, lean Conserves new ground Breaks new ground, crosses barriers First decision peoplea Second decision peoplea Pastoral leaders Apostolic leaders Resources for sodalities Creates modalities and sodalities Occasionally multiples Inherently expansionistic Five-generation life cycle Extended generational life cycle Connectional ecclesiology Can be transdenominational Near-neighbor missionality Cross-culturally capable Builds and establishes Inherently entrepreneurial aAll believers make a decisive first choice to become followers.</p>
<p>But only some are converted again to surrendering their lives to serve Jesus in a concentrated and intentional way. 244 the permanent revolution Outer ring Inner circle Trophimus The core ministry.35 From what we can discern, Paul’s apostolic band might look like that in Figure 11.3.</p>
<p>The demanding, translocal, cross-cultural nature of Paul’s ministry necessitated a structure different from that of a local church.</p>
<p>Paul’s ministry involved evangelism and gospel planting in a hostile environment spread out over a wide geographical area.</p>
<p>It could be carried out only by a team of individuals called together for that specific purpose.</p>
<p>It would not have been realistic to expect such work from every member of the church at Antioch.</p>
<p>Paul did expect the local expression of the church to participate in his mission through prayer and financial support.</p>
<p>But he called only a few individuals out of their local church to join his apostolic band who all added to the strength of a highly focused team to Paul’s missionary endeavors.36 Ralph Winter argued that the expansion of the church has always been carried on most effectively when these modalities and sodalities accepted each other’s legitimacy and worked together.37 The New Testament church existed in both forms—the translocal and the local—and each had elements of one in the other.</p>
<p>Neither is inferior.</p>
<p>When each accepts and receives the other’s role, the church is wired for movement (Figure 11.4).</p>
<p>Reframing church structure around modality and sodality helps us understand one of the roles that the local church is to play in relation to apostolic architecture 245 apostolic ministry: to empower what is already taking shape in apostolic people.</p>
<p>This implies a higher level of sensitivity and flexibility than is usually found in the local church.</p>
<p>It takes a real commitment to the extension of Christianity for a local community to release its apostolic leaders to pursue their callings.</p>
<p>In our experience, when the local community does not release them, they likely end up leaving anyway, but without the network or resources to best fulfill their calling.</p>
<p>Church Resource Ministries’ Sam Metcalf, a keen advocate of Winter’s typology, gives a good summary in his lecture notes that shows the issue of commitment is a critical factor that distinguishes these two basic structures:38 Sodalities are primarily task oriented and focus around a shared sense of mission that is often narrowly defined (examples are most parachurch agencies like Navigators and Campus Crusade for Christ).</p>
<p>Part of their function is to help modalities be healthy and to create new modalities (examples are Church Resource Ministries, Exponential, Future Travelers, Forge, Missio, 3DM, and other parachurch agencies created to support the church).</p>
<p>Sodalities frequently multiply modalities as well as more sodalities, as church planting agencies do.</p>
<p>They are apostolic structures in that they facilitate and extend the apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>The life span and life cycle of a sodality are typically longer than those of a modality because the sodality can enforce discipline. 246 the permanent revolution People can be fired from a sodality for not doing their job.</p>
<p>That is a standard that the church in its local form rarely attempts.</p>
<p>Although sodalities can form within denominations in the Protestant movement, they are frequently transdenominational in reach and focus.</p>
<p>The stimulus for ongoing renewal and spiritual vitality most commonly flows from sodalities into the modalities.</p>
<p>In the urban church planting movement in Melbourne that I (Alan) used to lead, we took the modality-sodality dimension with great seriousness.</p>
<p>So when we planted a church in our red-light district, we first set up a sodalic group, St.</p>
<p>Kilda Gatehouse.</p>
<p>Gatehouse performed all the functions of a sodality (missional functions, outreach, church planting, training) in the local area and in effect planted, and subsequently supported, the church plant called Matthew’s Party, which did the discipling, ran local services, conducted counseling, and so on.</p>
<p>Matthew’s Party in turn supported Gatehouse in any way it could, such as financially and by releasing possible new leaders into the wider ministry.</p>
<p>We did the same when planting congregations in the Jewish community of Melbourne: we set up Celebrate Messiah (led by my brother, Lawrence), an agency that has planted three congregations and has led international work among Jews in Israel and Russia.</p>
<p>This proved to be an effective strategy, but the key is to be sure that the sense of mutuality and relationship is maintained in both structures, even if it means writing such a relationship into the constitution or by-laws.</p>
<p>They must be deliberately designed for interdependence.</p>
<p>Hugh Halter and Matt Smay also recommend and illustrate a similar approach in their book And, based on the experience of working for Missio, a training agency, and planting a local movement with many congregations (called Addulum).39 There have been, and continue to be, some remarkable sodalities in the history of the church: the monastic movement in the early period (Cistercian, Benedictine), the missional orders (Franciscans, Sisters of Charity), the Protestant missionary organizations (China Inland Missions, Overseas Missionary Fellowship), and the parachurches (Campus Crusade, Youth for Christ) are all classic examples of sodalities that have advanced the cause of Christ and brought renewal to the church.</p>
<p>Some of the more notable examples of new sodalic missional orders in our day is associated with the so-called New Monasticism, a movement deliberately committed to taking the gospel to the poor.</p>
<p>Examples include, among others, Rutba House Fellowship in North Carolina; Urban Neighbors of Hope in Melbourne and Bangkok; Innerchange in San Francisco, apostolic architecture 247 London, Cambodia, Romania, and Venezuela; and The Simple Way in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To Organize or Not to Organize?</p>
<p>Putting aside the Christendom heritage and how that still biases our organizations, most denominational templates were formed following the model of the centralized management systems of the industrial era, models that are now rightly considered defunct by most corporations.</p>
<p>We believe that it is well past time for us to return to our most primal and effective form: the apostolic movement.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that we are at our very best when we have little of the paraphernalia that we now consider vital to the church.</p>
<p>The U.S. church spends over $70 billion every decade on plant and resources, and we are experiencing decline in adherence and membership at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Leadership needs to look beyond the expediencies of the status quo and make choices to design for advance and health.</p>
<p>We do not think it is possible to improve on the blueprint that is written in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In reembracing the permanent revolution, we will be well on our way to the recovery of a church inherently designed for advance. ‌conclusion it was design expert bruce mau who said that we typically do not pay any attention to design until something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Design seemingly comes out from hiding at these moments, and we suddenly begin to pay attention to the deeper, often unseen world of design that so radically shapes, informs, influences, and directs our imagination and practice.</p>
<p>We stand at a pivotal moment in history where the issues of design are calling out for us to pay attention and reimagine our vocation from within a context where Christianity is increasingly finding itself at the edge of the cultural landscape.</p>
<p>It is from within this place of marginality that we are poised to rediscover and reactivate our most generative forms of ministry and leadership.</p>
<p>And while the prophetic and evangelistic ministries invite a more thorough exploration, it is the apostles, and their distinctly missional vocation, who present themselves to us at this hour.</p>
<p>They are, like the other four APEST ministries, a gift of grace to the church in all ages, and a particular grace for this time and place.</p>
<p>As with all of God’s other gifts and graces, they beckon a response.</p>
<p>To the degree that we allow ourselves to stand under the ascended Christ and allow his wisdom and authority to shape our imagination and practice, we will experience revolution.</p>
<p>We are designed for continuous movement, and apostles are the permanent revolutionaries given to the church to catalyze the permanent revolution.</p>
<p>If we can receive them yet again, we not only open ourselves up to a permanent revolution, we also open ourselves up more fully to the One who has given them to us.</p>
<p>It is not too much to say that in the vocation and person of Jesus, apostles stand at the door and knock.</p>
<p>If we let them in, we will, once again, God willing, experience the permanent revolution that we were intended to be in the first place. ‌afterword I can remember coming out of theological college in England in the early 1980s and moving into my first parish job where I was to be the local vicar. I had an endless number of ideas and aspirations of how this local expression of the body of Christ could, with God’s Spirit, push the kingdom forward.</p>
<p>There were places of great darkness, and we would bring the light of Jesus.</p>
<p>The kingdom would advance and heaven would be brought to earth.</p>
<p>We would do things that were beyond out of the box, that were beyond the hallowed halls of the Sunday worship service.</p>
<p>We would continue worshiping on Sunday, of course, but we would innovate vehicles of mission and discipleship to push forward the destiny of God’s sent people.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, this was met by a less-than-tepid response by my parishioners: “That’s not your job.</p>
<p>Your job is to care for us [as a pastor would] and teach and preach from the Bible on Sunday and Wednesday nights [as a teacher would].</p>
<p>We give our tithe to pay missionaries in other countries [and your salary].</p>
<p>You’re the pastor.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that.” Now I had not grown up in the church.</p>
<p>At sixteen I picked up the Bible, read it cover to cover, and became a Christian. I was under the impression that what I had read in the Gospels and in the book of Acts was how the church actually functioned.</p>
<p>It was a bit jarring to walk into the local church for the first time and see that it was only a shadow of what I’d read in scripture.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, that’s always a tough pill to swallow and let’s just say the pill only went halfway down. I continued with the pastoral care and brought strong preaching from the Word, but on the side (and then slowly into church life) we brought these more entrepreneurial kingdom endeavors.</p>
<p>Some of them worked, some of them didn’t.</p>
<p>But asking me to stop trying new things to advance the kingdom was like asking a fish not to swim in the water: It’s how I was created.</p>
<p>It’s how I function. I recognized the importance of pastoral care and teaching, and I certainly wasn’t suggesting the removal of them in our church.</p>
<p>But intuitively I was 252 afterword asking for the addition and the proper place of the Apostolic voice.</p>
<p>And at that time I didn’t even know that’s what I was asking for.</p>
<p>All I knew was that I was called to lead this particular church, and I couldn’t help but start new things.</p>
<p>So I continued in the local church, serving faithfully in the traditional senses, but constantly experimenting and responding to fresh vision and revelation from the Lord, pushing into places where there was no gospel presence.</p>
<p>After several years of doing this, serving in the poorest place in all of Britain, a few years in the United States, and then back to the United Kingdom, something happened: All of that pioneering led to the creation of a spectacular missional vehicle that would not only transform our church into the largest church in England, but also spawned a missional movement in Europe and now onto the shores of American soil.</p>
<p>Today, these midsized groups of twenty to fifty people on mission together are called Missional Communities and they have, in many places, started to change the way the Western church functions.</p>
<p>Now this book you are holding is not about Missional Communities, and it is certainly not about my story.</p>
<p>But it is about how my story doesn’t need to be a rare one or even the exception to the rule.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that most apostles, after years of being misunderstood or cast out, simply give up, either by leaving the church or by slowly conforming to the more accepted and traditional roles of teacher/pastor. I struggled for years and years, never realizing there was another way of understanding my vocation, and when I finally understood how I was created, God used our church and my leadership for his purposes.</p>
<p>But that only happened when I fully embraced my place as an apostle.</p>
<p>My story can be the common story.</p>
<p>This book is about the searching for that common story, about how the releasing of the apostolic genius in the local church will bring about other missional and discipling vehicles that will lead the body of Christ to its destiny.</p>
<p>It’s about understanding the place of the apostle within the whole of the five-fold ministry gifts, how it functions uniquely within the church, and how it can be released to take the church into the future.</p>
<p>To watch the kingdom unfold before us as the Spirit leads.</p>
<p>Like the Paul or Columbo or Aidan or John Wesley before us, the Western church desperately needs to re-legitimize the apostolic voice.</p>
<p>Not only understand it.</p>
<p>Release it.</p>
<p>Why the urgency? I come from a place where less than 1 percent of the population is in a church on any given Sunday. I look around in the states, in this place I now call home, and I see that Gen Y (the oldest of whom have already turned 30, had kids, bought homes) are only attending church on any given Sunday at a 4 percent clip.</p>
<p>The Western church, yes, even afterword 253 the North American church, are staring over the precipice of complete irrelevance and stagnation and the apostolic voice needs to step up into its God-given place and be the catalyst of a new missional and discipling movement. I am not a “doom-and-gloom” futurist about the church in the West, but I am a realist.</p>
<p>We need all five ministries from Ephesians 4 in their proper place, functioning together for this movement to happen.</p>
<p>That means now is time for the restoration of the apostolic voice.</p>
<p>For that to happen, what we must see is that every “vocation” develops its own scriptural templates, practices, and paradigms.</p>
<p>But for quite some time the apostolic vocatio, long in exile, has lacked these basic necessities that have been so readily available to the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>One of the signs of a particular vocation—churchwise or secular—is the acceptance and development of these tools, which confirms its own legitimate standing in relation to other vocations. I see this book as a significant step forward in that legitimization process.</p>
<p>It develops a vocational language and practice, intertwining features and paradigms from other overlapping disciplines and thought constructs, and combines them to formulate a unique platform.</p>
<p>It allows those in other vocations, like the shepherd for example, to look in on the apostolic and say “Ahh!</p>
<p>That’s what the apostolic does!</p>
<p>That’s what they are good at!</p>
<p>That’s where they fit in the big picture!” It isn’t to say that the apostolic is more important.</p>
<p>It’s to say that without it, the Body of Christ is incomplete as it serves a key function in leading the church toward its destiny in the same way that we are incomplete if we lack compassion for hurting and broken people.</p>
<p>When I started in ministry more than thirty years ago, no such strain of thinking or book existed. I was looked at with dis-ease and a certain amount of paranoia.</p>
<p>It was generally accepted that I was called to the local church, but no one quite knew what to do with me.</p>
<p>My hope and prayer is that if you find yourself in a similar situation, if you have been created with that apostolic gifting and voice, that you will find hope and fresh vision within the pages of this book.</p>
<p>If you are not, my prayer is that God will give you revelation as to why apostles are so necessary and how he might be intertwining your life and ministry with that of this specific ministry gift.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that they are inexorably linked.</p>
<p>Above all, know that this book is truly a gift, one that many before you hoped for long ago, and one that has finally been written.</p>
