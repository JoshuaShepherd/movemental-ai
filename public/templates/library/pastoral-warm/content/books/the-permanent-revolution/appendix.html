<h2>Chapter Two: An Elegant Solution</h2>
<p>As we shall see in Part Two, the apostle is the most translocal of all the ministries.</p>
<p>Apostles have the most responsibility for the regional cohesion of the movement.</p>
<p>But they also have to keep strong relational connections to the local churches—hence, our use of the term glocal.</p>

<p>For instance, church historian David Aune, in his comprehensive study of the nature of the prophetic, notes the complex relationship between the prophetic ministry and the increasing institutionalization of the church: “In the absence of the more complex bureaucratic organization which accompanied the institutionalization of early Christianity, prophets appear to have played a more visible and active role in guiding Christian communities in decision making by reiterating the norms and values which were an integral part of Christian tradition and by providing the communities with visible evidence of the presence and activity of God and Jesus.</p>
<p>The growth of local bureaucracies, often in the form of the triad of offices consisting of bishop, presbyters and deacons, resulted in the increasing exclusion of prophets from active roles in the guidance of the communities.” D. E.</p>

<p>Patton and Woods are helpful here: “The impulse of some artistic, passionate, and outspoken members of a church—those, perhaps, with heightened prophetic sensibilities—is to withdraw from the community of believers who might not faithfully support their art or adequately appreciate their outcries over injustice.</p>
<p>They may feel free in their isolation, but only for a while.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>In their seclusion, they end up surrounding themselves only with others who agree with them.</p>
<p>As such, they abandon the more complex, demanding, and often frustrating environment of the larger community.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes the frustration within the community is the very notes 279 thing that energizes and refines the prophetic sensibility.” P. D.</p>

<p>For instance, Kim says, “Would we have embraced the church growth movement as readily as we have otherwise with its goal of ‘bigger = better’?</p>
<p>Would we have as uncritically let business world practices, language and ‘job descriptions’ encroach into church life and administration (e.g., ‘executive pastor’)?</p>

<p>This kind of evangelistic training resonates only with the proclamation folks, leaving the others wondering if they are truly evangelistic.</p>

<p>Apostolic ministry, when isolated from the other ministries, operates under the same human restraints as the other callings: it does not give us complete access to a panoramic view of the gospel.</p>
<p>But it does provide insight into a foundational part of the gospel that is often displaced: extension.</p>
<p>Since the gospel is meant for all, then it is quintessentially apostolic in nature.</p>
<p>It is meant to travel across social and spatial boundaries, and apostolic ministry best illustrates this facet of the gospel to us.</p>
<p>The missional implications of the gospel, and the trajectory of Christianity as a living system, are functional qualities that find their most vivid demonstration in apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>For instance, it is a lot easier to understand Paul as apostle if we begin to see that for him, the gospel was not just a set of propositions to believe but a dynamic spiritual force, a revolutionary movement with a distinct vision, a way of operating, and an agenda—in fact, nothing less than the transformation of the world.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated in the universal scope of the gospel as mentioned in Romans 5:18 (“all people”), Colossians 1:19 (“all things”), and 1 Corinthians 15:27–28 (“all things).” At the core of the gospel is a message for all ethnicities, and the apostle’s job is to make sure that this message is faithfully delivered.</p>
<p>The wording of the subhead for this section comes from W.</p>
<p>Simson, who in his Starfish Manifesto (Oct. 2009), http://en.starfishportal.net, discusses prophetic intelligence for apostolic architecture.</p>
<p>For an online copy of the book, go to http://en.starfishportal.net/.</p>
<p>We know that the reference to prophets here is not to the Old Testament prophets because apostles did not exist in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The reference here is to the apostles and prophets of the New Testament church, which Paul mentions again in Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we know this text includes apostles outside the twelve and Paul because it alludes to prophets as well.</p>
<p>The question is, which prophets?</p>
<p>What were their names?</p>
<p>If the scope of application for apostles is only the twelve, how do we apply the same metrics of application to the reference of prophets?</p>
<p>Surely one foundational category (apostles) cannot be strictly confined to the twelve or Paul, while the other foundational category can be highly ambiguous, with no apparent point of reference.</p>
<p>The only conclusion we can come to is that the reference to apostles and prophets as being foundational refers primarily to the ministries that flow out of these functions.</p>
<p>The word entrepreneur finds its linguistic roots in Latin and comes from the combination of intrare, meaning “to enter” or “to penetrate in between,” and prehendere, meaning “to grasp or seize hold of.” These two concepts of entering and seizing lie behind the concept of the entrepreneurial mind-set.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial people have the ability to recognize opportunities and act on them with innovative vision and zeal. notes 281 In many ways, this conforms to best thinking in terms of organizational learning, as well as the dynamics of innovation.</p>
<p>Learning takes place when programming is subjected to questioning.</p>
<p>Serious evaluation, feedback, and some discomfort are necessary prerequisites to learning and innovation.</p>
<p>But the key remains the same: asking the right questions.</p>
<p>And that is clearly a prophetic function.</p>
<p>This process, called anything from “surfing the edge of chaos” to “the burning platform,” is vital to getting existing organizations moving again and is the sweet spot for innovation.</p>
<p>In fact, what we now know from the fields of leadership and organizations existed theologically long before in the organization of the church, where it is embedded in our deepest ecclesiological codes.</p>
<p>Acts 21 describes a rather confusing encounter between Paul the apostle and Agabus the prophet.</p>
<p>Agabus warns Paul of the imminent danger for him in Jerusalem, advice that Paul disregards.</p>
<p>The likely interpretation is that because Paul was determined to carry the collection from the Gentiles into Jerusalem, he did not heed this warning and ended up short-circuiting his apostolic ministry through imprisonment.</p>
<p>Agabus was trying to provide some direction to Paul’s ministry, but Paul had his own strategy and time line.</p>
<p>He was so invested in his personal mission (here, getting to Jerusalem) that it was hard for him to heed the warning of imminent danger. “Who Are These Guys?” New Covenant Ministries International, http:// www.ncmi.net/WhoAreTheseGuys/tabid/54/language/en-US/Default.aspx. “The Order of Mission,” http://www.missionorder.org/.</p>
<p>This law, developed by Jane Mansbridge, a sociologist, maintains that “every social movement tends to splinter into sects, unless it wins quickly, in which case it turns into a collections of institutions.” Because the very dynamic that binds people to a movement (its ideology and cause) tends to be idealistic, radical, and exclusive, this will work against them if they cannot produce fruit from their efforts.</p>
<p>Their radical exclusivity will inevitably turn on itself.</p>
<p>The socialist movement in the United States demonstrates this law.</p>
<p>The labor movement turned into an institution and the Communist party into a sect.</p>

<p>We explore the inexorable association with innovation and the generative APE types in Chapter Four.</p>
<p>This shift to evangelism as a local church function has precipitated a major crisis in the parachurches that were set up to do evangelism on behalf of local churches.</p>
<p>In many ways, the parachurches arose out of the unfaithfulness of local church leadership to take responsibility for evangelism.</p>
<p>The Reveal study stemming from the Willow Creek Association acknowledges this problem.</p>
<p>Evangelistic ministry, taken on its own, can precipitate great growth in the church, but it is unsure of what to do with new members once they are integrated into a group and attend regularly. 282 notes Much of the theory and story of the Future Travelers’ learning journey is found in A.</p>

<p>Some point to Phillip as functioning cross-culturally through his travels to Samaria and predominantly Gentile cities, but we have to remember that the name Phillip is thought by most scholars to be a Greek, or Hellenistic, name.</p>
<p>It is possible that Phillip, through his family of origin, was already acculturated into, and even developed an affinity for, a more Hellenized context—hence, his selection by the church in Jerusalem to work with the Grecian widows who were being overlooked in the distribution of food.</p>
<p>They also selected a proselyte from Antioch, which reveals their bias in selecting people who could relate to those who were not of Hebrew descent.</p>
<p>We see this same pattern of retreating to places of solitude in several of the prophets’ ministries in scripture.</p>
<p>Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist, and Jesus spent time away from their context of ministry, only to return to that context to speak or act on what they had experienced.</p>
<p>Paul Patton and Robert Woods help bring clarity to this issue of critical distance by contrasting the prophet with the traditional understanding of the detached critic: “Prophetic criticism requires critical distance.</p>
<p>But how much?</p>
<p>In the conventional view, the critic is an unattached spectator, a dispassionate outsider.</p>
<p>In contrast, the prophet is a connected critic: someone who is connected to the people she criticizes through a shared tradition and group identity.</p>
<p>So, ‘critical distance is best measured in inches, not miles.’” The prophetic ministry is not designed for isolation.</p>
<p>Critical distance plays its most effective role when it prepares the prophet to return to the community with fresh insight and critical engagement of his or her context.</p>

<p>It is articulated through the APEST test (www.apest.org), developed by Alan Hirsch and Brian Schubring of Leadership Vision Consulting, which helps you identify your primary and secondary gifting profiles.</p>
<p>Another way of saying it is that in any system of interaction (for example, between individual human beings), the part of the system with the greatest flexibility in its behaviors will control the system.</p>
<p>To be sure, when a system increases its complexity, it also increases its ability to engage the complexity of its environment and adapt to its unique challenges.</p>
<p>Increasing complexity is tricky business because at some point, too much complexity can become a liability.</p>
<p>This is the very thing that overly bureaucratic organizations encounter.</p>
<p>Conversely, not enough complexity will limit the organization’s ability to engage the complexity of its environment.</p>
<p>Too much or too little can cause any living system to lose its edge and become vulnerable to environmental challenges.</p>
<p>All the churches going through 3DM training apply the model, and many others report application.</p>

<p>In 1 Corinthians 4:14–21, Paul is not just reminding them of his instrumental role in bringing them into existence as a community through the gospel.</p>
<p>This serves only to frame his parental rights to address the sexual immorality in 1 Corinthians 5 that is threatening the purity and overall vitality of the community.</p>
<p>Later in the letter, Paul draws further implications from his role as father by drawing from the traditional Jewish marriage customs in which the father of the bride-to-be is charged with safeguarding his daughter’s virginity between the time of their betrothal and the time in which he actually leads her into the bridegroom’s house.</p>
<p>As the father of the Corinthians, Paul has a vested interest in seeing them remain pure and undefiled, fully devoted to their husband, Christ, until they are presented to him at the wedding. 2 Corinthians 11:1–2.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Crofton addresses the notorious difficulty of sorting out the “we” statements of Paul in 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p>He accurately observes that Paul uses “we” in 2 Corinthians as a rhetorical device to “blur the distinction between himself and his apostolic task.</p>
<p>The presence of Paul in this letter is almost never that of a singular person.</p>
<p>Personal apostleship is consistently swallowed up by generic apostleship.</p>
<p>There is no apostolic parousia [presence] form, for Paul desires to reduce rather than promote the actualization of his presence in the letter.</p>
<p>The first person singular pronoun is virtually absent; Paul’s consistent use of ‘we’ rather than ‘I’ focuses attention away from Paul the apostle toward Paul and his colleagues, toward apostles in general.” J. A.</p>

<p>Ephesians 3:1–8.</p>
<p>Economics is not only about value; it is also about the exchange of value.</p>
<p>If we can elaborate on Paul’s metaphor here of oikonomia, the gospel is valuable in and of itself in relation to God, but its value is fully realized only when it enters the marketplace and interacts within the economy of human relationships, institutions, society, and culture.</p>
<p>Apostles are economists of the gospel because they initiate this exchange and add value through the gospel to our social economies. J. H.</p>
<p>Schutz, Paul and the Anatomy of Apostolic Authority (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox Press), pp. 35, 36. notes 285 Ibid., p. 123.</p>
<p>What we must realize is that the real power always resides in the gospel itself and that the apostle is always only an interpreter and integrator of its force in the community or movement.</p>
<p>The gospel forever remains the ruling concept; all other agents are subordinated to it, including the apostle and the faith community itself.</p>
<p>So in Paul’s writings, for instance, not a word is said about the community being directly subordinated to Paul.</p>
<p>Rather, because the gospel takes precedence, both Paul and the community can be subordinated to it.</p>
<p>Paul can preach only what he has already preached, and the community can receive only what it has already received.</p>
<p>The gospel is thus a double-sided standard—both preaching and receiving.</p>
<p>It is a standard for authentic faith as well as for authentic apostleship.</p>
<p>By virtue of their common dependence on and the need for their obedience to the one gospel, faith and apostleship are brought into the closest possible relationship.</p>

<p>Without the apostolic person (and to a certain extent the evangelist), the gospel tends to move around like a ball in the pinball machine.</p>

<p>What follows is an elaboration of the material contained in Hirsch, The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Brazos Press, 2006).</p>
<p>In my (Alan) centerpiece book, The Forgotten Ways, I suggest that these codes themselves comprise a sixfold complex of distinctive elements, each called mDNA (missional DNA), that together make up apostolic genius—the life force that pulsates through every transformative Jesus movement in history.</p>
<p>The six interrelating elements are Jesus is Lord—the heart and soul of Jesus movements, which is the central and organizing element; disciple making—ensuring the embodiment and transmission of the message through adherence to Jesus’s way; the missional-incarnational impulse, describing a way of extending and planting the Jesus movement; an apostolic environment, which explores the nature of the at least fivefold ministry that is the subject of this book; organic systems, which explore the church’s organization as movement and its viral, reproductive tendencies; and communitas, which describes the type of community that forms in the context of ordeal, missional challenge, adventure, and risk.</p>
<p>Each chapter in Part Two of The Forgotten Ways explores each of these elements.</p>
<p>See also the glossary in The Forgotten Ways, p. 283.</p>
<p>For example, it is implied throughout the common use of the indicative and imperatives in the New Testament itself.</p>
<p>The indicative creates identity and 286 notes gives this a basis in Christ and his work in the world.</p>
<p>The imperatives arise directly out of a sense of who we are in Christ.</p>

<p>We acknowledge once again that aspects of this verse refer to the unique role of the twelve apostles.</p>
<p>But we, along with others, suggest that something of the foundational aspect of apostolic ministry is inherent in all forms of apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>The apostolic function continues to provide something of a catalytic function for the ministry of the people of God.</p>
<p>See, for instance, Andrew Lincoln in the Word Biblical Commentary where he notes that the apostles referred to in Ephesians 2:12 encompass the twelve but extend to others who fit the category. “Ephesians,” Word Biblical Commentary, commentary on 2:12.</p>

<p>Even the office of the bishop, the institutional replacement of the prior apostolic role, serves as a custodian of apostolicity (viewed here as inherent in the church and in the New Testament scriptures); it is viewed as “having in himself all the other ministries,” which are in turn conferred to others by ordination.</p>
<p>See J.</p>
<p>McQuarrie, Principles of Christian Theology (London: SCM, 1966), p. 391.</p>
<p>In instituting the bishop, Christendom took the pioneer aspect out of the equation, institutionalized apostolicity in church and office, and reshaped it in a distinctly pastoral image to suit the diocesan context, but it did keep some authentic aspects of the apostolic role that were useful to it.</p>
<p>This founding role is one of them, and in it a true function of the apostolic can still be discerned.</p>

<p>Adapted from the insights of Mike Kim in “Our Journey into Rediscovering Apostolic and Prophetic Foundations, Part 3,” House2House Ezine, Jan. 29, 2010, http://www.story.house2house.com/2010/01/29/ our-journey-into-rediscovering-apostolic-and-prophetic-foundations-part-3/.</p>
<p>Mike Kim says, “Like scaffolding that sticks around beyond its usefulness, leaders often default on staying longer in their role for the sake of ‘ministry quality’ that ends up severely limiting the net quality and quantity of workers in the harvest.” Chapter Six: Come Back, Peter; Come Back, Paul D.</p>
<p>Scoggins, “Nurturing a Generation of ‘Pauline’ and ‘Petrine’ Apostles,” Apostolic Ministry, Apr. 4, 2009, http://bit.ly/g3xZKf.</p>
<p>It was the nineteenth-century German theologian Martin Kahler who is credited with saying, “Mission is the mother of all theology.” notes 287 Even here, Peter is addressing people with large amounts of religious capital, specifically Jews.</p>
<p>So although they may be from different countries and provinces, and consequently different cultural spheres, Peter is still within the orbit of the already existing people of God. “Generally, the opening statement of this Peter cycle reports that the apostle ‘went here and there among all the believers’ or, more literally—‘passed through all of them,’ that is, through all of the areas in the region where believers resided.” F. S.</p>
<p>Spencer, Journeying Through Acts: A Literary-Cultural Reading (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2004), p. 112.</p>
<p>The fact that Peter is functioning alone, without any “witnesses” traveling with him (such as the episode in Acts 8 with the Samaritans), shows the generic nature of his ministry in this region.</p>
<p>Peter is simply doing what he does best and was commissioned to do by Jesus in John 21.</p>
<p>He is feeding the sheep out of an apostolic vision.</p>
<p>It is not until Acts 10 that Peter sees the need to take six witnesses with him to Caesarea in order to meet Cornelius, the God-fearing Gentile, and present the gospel to him and his household.</p>
<p>It is possible that Peter does the same thing in Corinth in light of the controversies swirling around factional groups claiming “Cephas” as one of their leaders.</p>
<p>At any rate, even his interactions with Cornelius reveal that Peter is still interacting within the orbit of people who have significant levels of religious capital, God fearers.</p>
<p>This encounter stretched Peter, but it should be noted that Peter is not interacting with Gentile pagans.</p>
<p>This kind of cultural distance shows up more visibly in Paul’s ministry. D. E.</p>
<p>Myerson, Tempered Radicals: How Everyday Leaders Inspire Change at Work (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2003).</p>
<p>Petrine apostles today can take on the form of church consultants.</p>
<p>But we need to be clear about this: the impact is not just a more effective operational organization, but rather a more distinctly missional one.</p>
<p>And it is not just boosting the church’s evangelistic appeal either.</p>
<p>Such apostleship should help mobilize the church for missional and incarnational expressions and, as Reggie McNeal says, “change the scorecard” of what growth and health look like.</p>

<p>McNeal, Missional Renaissance: Changing the Scorecard for the Church (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2009). “Intrapreneurship is now known as the practice of a corporate management style that integrates risk-taking and innovation approaches, as well as the reward and motivational techniques, that are more traditionally thought of as being the province of entrepreneurship.” “Intrapreneurship,” http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship.</p>
<p>The categorizations here are inspired by N.</p>
<p>Thornberry, Lead Like an Entrepreneur: Keeping the Entrepreneurial Spirit</p>
<p>Alive Within the Corporation (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006).</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to describe what we are attempting to do here is captured by Max Weber’s concept of the ideal type.</p>
<p>As articulated by Joseph Blenkinsopp, Weber’s ideal type is “a construction based on abstraction and 288 notes conceptualization that has the purpose of guiding inquiry back into the mass of available data.</p>
<p>They are a means of provisional classification, allowing for some preliminary understanding of the phenomenon, creating and testing hypotheses, distinguishing between constants and variables, and identifying deviations.” J.</p>
<p>Blenkinsopp, Sage, Priest, Prophet: Religious and Intellectual Leadership in Ancient Israel (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox Press, 1995), p. 116.</p>
<p>Our effort to classify apostolic people and their ministries should be seen as an attempt to construct an ideal type; as in Weber’s understanding, we are not trying to create water-tight compartments with hardand-fast definitions.</p>
<p>The term deep structure was first used in R.</p>
<p>Drazin and L. E.</p>
<p>Sandelands, “Autogenesis: A Perspective on the Process of Organizing,” Organization Science, 1992, 3, 230–249.</p>
<p>It should be abundantly clear by now that we do not believe in apostolic succession as it is formulated by Rome and affirmed to a lesser degree by other variations of sacramental, high church ecclesiology.</p>
<p>We see that this was part of the later reappropriation of apostolic authority used to bolster the institution of the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is unlikely that Jesus, the archetypal prophet, who reserves his harshest words for religious professionals and religious institutions, would authorize any institution in this way, thereby substituting one for another.</p>
<p>Rather, we should read this for what it is: a commissioning of an apostle—in this case, the one who was to lead the others.</p>

<p>There is no evidence, outside of Acts 2 and 10, that Peter founded any churches at all in the Pauline sense.</p>
<p>This could be why 1 Peter is addressed to churches in the Asia Minor Province, an area where Paul had developed a church planting movement.</p>
<p>Peter seems to be operating in his apostolic vocation by addressing the already existing people of God through these letters.</p>

<p>Whatever has been initiated in the missio Dei, the Incarnation, and the Cross is not yet complete until Jesus returns, with all that this means for the world and the church.</p>
<p>There is also a well-noted relationship between suffering and sanctification in Peter’s writings, a suffering that arises from the tension felt between the times.</p>
<p>These are distinctly eschatological themes.</p>
<p>While Paul is in Jerusalem, he is always stirring up trouble and stepping on toes.</p>
<p>He may find himself in politically charged environments, but he does not navigate them well.</p>
<p>One has to wonder why he stirs up all kinds of trouble while the other apostles, still ministering in word and in prayer in the Jerusalem church, seem to be getting along fairly well with others in the city.</p>
<p>Paul is culturally savvy, but he is not necessarily politically savvy.</p>
<p>Peter, in contrast, is quick to accommodate the popular census, evidenced by his actions in Antioch.</p>

<p>From a conversation with Dallas Willard in March 2010.</p>
<p>All this squares well with the formative thinking of the sociologist Max Weber.</p>
<p>Weber maintained that the process of institutionalization and renewal involved a constant return to the charismatic center in order to relegitimize or, in our language, refound the subsequent movement.</p>
<p>To remain true, all religious organizations require a form of renewal that encompasses a return to the original ethos and the power of the founder.</p>
<p>And whether one applies this to a denomination or to Christianity as a whole, one can refer to this rediscovery of one’s original message as radical traditionalism because it goes back to the organization’s deepest tradition and reinterpret it for a new context.</p>
<p>Quoted in Hirsch and Frost, ReJesus, p. 77.</p>
<p>Although many people use the term radical to mean a departure from the traditional, it in fact refers to a return to the root cause of a thing.</p>
<p>Thinkexist .com defines radical as “of or pertaining to the root or origin; reaching to the center, to the foundation, to the ultimate sources, to the principles, or the like; original; fundamental; thorough-going; unsparing; extreme; as in radical evils; radical reform; a radical party” (http://thinkexist.com/dictionary/ meaning/radical/).</p>

<p>The designation skunk works is widely used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with working on advanced or secret projects.</p>
<p>Although we think the idea is good, what we have in mind is something that is more a part of the actual organization itself rather than being an isolated unit with little or no legitimacy.</p>
<p>Morris, Entrepreneurial Intensity, p. 19.</p>
<p>We are indebted to Morris for the insights set out in this section.</p>
<p>An example of this is what is happening to the publishing world today.</p>
<p>Digital media are game changers.</p>
<p>This has been accelerated by the introduction of the electronic readers and, even more so, Apple’s iPad.</p>
<p>Also, what is less known about the acute forms of entrepreneurial intensity perhaps is that many of these never make it to the light of day.</p>
<p>The problem is that such innovation is so far ahead of the game as not to be able to change it.</p>
<p>Such organizations and individuals can find themselves stranded.</p>
<p>An example is Macintosh’s Newton, its early tablet computer that was way ahead of its time.</p>
<p>For more about Fresh Expressions, see http://www.freshexpressions.org.uk/. ”The group’s purpose is to develop something quickly with minimal management constraints.</p>
<p>Skunk works are often used to initially roll out a product or service that thereafter will be developed according to usual business processes.” http://bit.ly/dS4Piu.</p>
<p>The approach is different from having an inhouse research and development function in that it is usually located far from the center of the organization and is somewhat secretive so that it can operate without the normal constraints of the organization.</p>
<p>However, because it is thus marginalized from the center, it seldom has an impact on the culture of an organization in a systemic and meaningful way.</p>
<p>See Hirsch and Ferguson, On the Verge, for the idea of 40:60 appeal.</p>
<p>Proven models, or algorithms, can play a significant role in the viability of any enterprise, but that role is inherently limited when we take in the scope of the missional mandate to seed the gospel among every group of people.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial force driving a franchising type of church planting movement will propel it across geographical boundaries, but it will struggle in crossing cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>Mass-producing the prevailing models of church may prove to be efficient in the short run, but in the long run, if the nature and scope of apostolic ministry do not begin to expand to include cross-cultural, and therefore incarnational, approaches, then despite our notes 293 apparent progress in geographical expansion, we will still be ignoring the more complex dimensions of the adaptive challenge.</p>
<p>The nature and scope of apostolic ministry need to experience a sort of disenfranchising in order to reach its full capacity for missional impact.</p>

<p>In light of this, we suggest that the more standard, and we would suggest secular, approach is to have a board of chickens rule and direct the pigs.</p>
<p>This might be fine in big corporations, but in start-ups or, in our case, missional projects, this is not good practice.</p>
<p>It is hard to see Paul outsourcing direction and policy to a board. J.</p>

<p>Nevius wrote his ideas in 1899 in The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches: His Basic Principles, where he suggested the following strategic guides to missions.</p>
<p>Christians should continue to live in their neighborhoods and pursue their occupations, being self-supporting and witnessing to their coworkers and neighbors.</p>
<p>Missions should develop only programs and institutions that the national church desires and supports.</p>
<p>The national churches should call out and support their own pastors.</p>
<p>Churches should be built in the native style with money and materials given by the church members.</p>
<p>Intensive biblical and doctrinal instruction should be provided for church leaders every year.</p>
<p>It is amazing that we are still trying to get missionaries to adopt these principles over 110 years later.</p>
<p>The “three-self” church strategy states that a church should be selfgoverning, self-supporting, and self-replicating.</p>
<p>These ideas infused Nevius’s thinking (they originally were called the Venn-Anderson principles).</p>

<p>For Nevius, see “John Livingstone Nevius,” http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/John_Livingstone_Nevius.</p>
<p>The further irony is that the state-sponsored church of China today is formally called the “Three Self Church,” and although it is growing, it is being seriously outpaced by the underground house church movement, which now intentionally practices the three-self principles.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that David Bosch added to the three-self principles the additional concept of self-theologizing.</p>
<p>This is a significant addition, but we opt to reformulate these principles for the Western context. D. J.</p>

<p>The authors compare this to the Baptist growth over the same period and noted that the Baptists insisted on similar educational qualifications only later in the twentieth century, which also initiated the decline of the Southern Baptists at that point.</p>
<p>The collegiate university was originally modeled after the inclusion of all the elements of the “universe.” As such, it sought to include as part of its repertoire of training and education a sampling of the basic fields and practices found in society.</p>
<p>If we reapply this rationale to seminaries and theological universities, it seems logical to include and organize the university around 300 notes the universal categories of ministry in Ephesians 4 that no less constitute the very church that those seminaries seek to serve and empower.</p>
<p>This is a far cry from the discipleship-based action learning system that the Bible itself maintains is necessary for theological integrity and to transfer faith meaningfully.</p>
<p>We typically quote Jesus as saying, “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), but we fail to put this in its immediate context, which changes the equation entirely.</p>
<p>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples” (John 8:31).</p>
<p>Understanding of truth, and experiencing the freedom found in it, is predicated on first being a disciple.</p>
<p>One cannot know truth divorced from the context of discipleship.</p>
<p>This insight is gleaned from friend and colleague Caesar Kalinowski.</p>

<p>Paul’s network of associates shared one fundamental characteristic inherent to the designation of coworker: their assistance to the apostle during one or more phases of his ministry.</p>
<p>Whether the coworkers labored independently on Paul’s behalf or served directly at his side, each of them helped him establish and maintain the work of the gospel.</p>
<p>This assistance grew out of the special relationships Paul developed with his coworkers.</p>
<p>Some of these relationships spanned many years, numerous missions, and various situations.</p>
<p>In others, association with Paul was more occasional in nature.</p>

<p>The book of Acts provides further insight into the activities of these apostolic bands.</p>
<p>In a given city, they preached the gospel and made disciples who were formed into a fellowship of believers.</p>
<p>The band then traveled to other centers to strengthen newly formed churches and returned to home base to report on the success of the mission and prepare for the next (for instance, Acts 14:21–28).</p>
<p>Winter, Perspectives on the World Christian Movement, points to the effectiveness of the monastic orders in the spread of the Christian faith during the postapostolic and medieval eras.</p>

<p>Smay, And: The Gathered and Scattered Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 2010).</p>
<p>Paul explicitly talks about the apostolic ministry (in this case, along with the prophetic ministry) as being foundational to the whole ecclesial project (Ephesians 2:20).</p>
<p>He also says that he sees it as his work to lay foundations (1 Corinthians 3:10–12).</p>
<p>Probably reflecting these, elsewhere he says that in relation to the other giftings, God has placed apostles first (protos) in the church (1 Corinthians 12:28).</p>
<p>However we might envisage this, it must mean that the apostolic has some kind of priority and prominence in the ministry mix.</p>
<p>Following the explicit commands and example of Christ in power relations, disciples are not allowed to conceive of their influence in a hierarchical manner (Luke 22:25–27; Philemon 2:1–11), and so when he says “first” in these places, it must mean something more akin to his use of themelios in Ephesians 2:20.</p>
<p>And so we believe that the apostolic ministry is in fact the grounding, orienting, or simply catalyst, one in relation to the other ministries and has a very important and ongoing place in the church.</p>
<p>In fact, Alan has argued that it is precisely this slippage of our moorings from our Founder that lies at the heart of all toxic expressions of Christian religion.</p>
<p>See A.</p>
<p>Hirsch and M.</p>
<p>Frost, ReJesus: A Wild Messiah for a Missional Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2009).</p>
<p>Without any consideration for any alternative position, the inherited teachings in this regard have effectively have become the theological justifications of the forces favoring equilibrium, for the spiritual coup d’état, and it has been effectively played out over the centuries. U.</p>
<p>Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How Got Licked (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1935, repr. 1994), p. 109.</p>
<p>Prophets also had itinerant ministries, as evidenced in the Didache, a Christian document composed in the later part of the first century of the church, but their ministry was focused on the people of God, not extending the gospel into new territories.</p>
<p>Most itinerant prophets ended up settling into a local community.</p>
<p>In fact, much of the Cessationist readings of the twentieth century have been shown to be precisely this type of tendentious exegesis—in this case, their personal and preferential distaste for all things charismatic.</p>
<p>Any attempt to undermine the fundamentally multidimensional ministry structure of the New Testament church turns out to be a selective, nuanced, and anachronistic reading.</p>
<p>Taken at face value and on its own terms, the New Testament itself makes no suggestions of the rescinding of the church’s ministry.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, any attempt to make it say something else is manipulative and dishonest.</p>
<p>See, for instance, L. D.</p>
<p>Edles and S.</p>
<p>Appelrouth, Sociological Theory in the Classical Era: Text and Readings (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Pine Forge Press, 302 notes 2010).</p>
<p>Every movement goes through phases of evolution and development, and the Jesus movement was no exception.</p>
<p>Jesus founds the movement, radically changes and empowers the apostles, and commissions them to disciple the nations (Matthew 28:18–20).</p>
<p>The apostles, though not alone in the ministry of Christ to the world, were the effective driving force in the expansion of the church.</p>
<p>Their translocal, boundary-crossing, somewhat entrepreneurial form of leadership kept the church on the missional trajectory Jesus envisioned.</p>
<p>Their distinctly missional form of leadership was an integral part of the church’s life and consciousness and enjoyed a definitive place in the intellectual real estate of the church.</p>
<p>It is logical that later generations would seek to try to encode and routinize their dynamic ministry.</p>
<p>For instance, this happens in the New Testament itself.</p>
<p>Describing the later Pauline communities, historian Harry Maier notes, “The evidence generally suggests that while Paul was still alive the process of institutionalization was in its early stages.</p>
<p>The passage of time, the growth of the group, the physical absence of the apostle, the repeated action of certain members—all these factors encouraged the development of organizational patterns, however informal.” H. O.</p>

<p>Chapter Three is in many ways an extensive elaboration of this in relation to the role of the Founder of Christianity in the ongoing movement that claims his name. “Herein lies an irresolvable dilemma for religious organizations: although religious movements are born out of firsthand religious experiences, they cannot survive and prosper without some form of stability and order.</p>
<p>The charism (the originating grace or gift) has to be diffused, ritualized, and mediated by the organization so that the initial gift of the founder can be made accessible through the organization itself.</p>
<p>While O’Dea saw this process of institutionalization as inevitable and even necessary, he also saw that it was paradoxically the process that would dilute or possibly even obliterate the initial message and ethos of the founder.</p>
<p>Yet this routinization of charisma has a tendency to snuff out the life it was meant to protect and enhance.</p>
<p>The crisis inevitably dawns when the outward forms of worship no longer match the inward experience and spiritual condition of the participants.</p>
<p>Decline becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>Authentic Christianity is subverted and constant renewals become necessary ... hence the need to re-Jesus the movement.” Frost and Hirsch, ReJesus, p. 77.</p>
<p>While institutionalization as structuring the common life is a normal process, institutionalism is another matter entirely.</p>
<p>When the institution takes on the notes 303 status of an –ism, a belief system, then it invariably begins to lay claims to authority and ultimately becomes idolatrous.</p>
<p>Because of this, we think it best to call the level of institutionalizing in the New Testament as “structuring” the organization or “rhythming” the life of the community because it has not yet hardened into the much more rigid institutionalism that would come with the legalization of Christianity with Constantine.</p>
<p>In other words, the persecuted underground church of the first few centuries was preinstitutional or simply structural rather than fully institutionalized.</p>
<p>The Church in Catholic theology is seen to be the mystical body of Christ, and the priestly system replaces the mediating work of Jesus.</p>
<p>The pope becomes the sole representative of Jesus on earth.</p>
<p>All this is the result of the transfer of the initial grace/charism of the movement into the institution.</p>
<p>The institution is then totemized; it becomes divine in itself.</p>
<p>For the tragic struggle between form and function in religious movements, see O’Dea, “Five Dilemmas of the Institutionalization of Religion.” Interestingly O’Dea is a Catholic theologian and priest.</p>

<p>Duguid, The Social Life of Information (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2000), for a discussion of how social context is important to the development and interpretation of information and ideas.</p>
<p>This accounts for one of the reasons that we always have to be deliberate and return continuously to the Founder of the Christian movement in an ongoing loop of renewal and relegitimization.</p>
<p>Again this is the core topic of Frost and Hirsch, ReJesus.</p>
<p>Another aspect worth noting here is that the biblical worldview itself is against such depersonalization of ideas.</p>
<p>Theological ideas should always guide and inform the relationship between God and his people.</p>
<p>In Hebraic perspective, ideas are never important in and of themselves.</p>
<p>They serve a greater reality.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we do not believe ideas are not important.</p>
<p>We have already asserted that they are.</p>
<p>But they must never be depersonalized and abstracted from that which they point to and from where they came from.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that there is not a canon of ideas (rightly contained in scripture) that serves as a authority and standard for the church’s thinking and behavior.</p>
<p>We are very orthodox (and conservative) in our view of scripture as authoritative for all matters of life and faith.</p>
<p>We are simply referring to the distinct idea that infers that we have effectively extracted (and replaced) the essence of apostolic ministry by encoding the doctrine that they taught.</p>
<p>This particular doctrine, and it is that, was used as a reason to reject the actual ministry.</p>

<p>He goes on to note that “the requirements of bureaucracy override such traditional differentiations of religious leadership as ‘prophet’ versus 304 notes ‘priest,’ ‘scholar versus saint,’ and so forth.</p>
<p>Thus it does not matter very much whether a certain bureaucratic functionary comes out of a protestant tradition of ‘prophetic’ ministry or a Catholic tradition of a ‘priestly’ one—in either case, he must above all adapt himself to the requirements of his bureaucratic role.” P. L.</p>

<p>It seems that certain styles of leadership change as an organization moves through its life cycle.</p>
<p>To start something from scratch requires something of the entrepreneurial risk-taking type of leader, something of a visionary (to use Miller’s term, the prophet-barbarian).</p>
<p>To structure for growth requires a different type of leadership again, one better able to manage the affairs of a growing concern.</p>
<p>In fact, when that is necessary, the initiating leader might actually become a hindrance to the organization’s health.</p>
<p>At the end of the life cycle are people who at best are maintainers of the system and at worst hinder its possible revitalization.</p>

<p>Applying this to the trajectory of early Christianity, the early experience of ecclesia was drawn from the Greco-Roman household (oikos) structure, which naturally supplied the initial organizational template for the church in the beginning.</p>
<p>The leadership roles emerged organically, from below, and were a natural development considering the connection the early church had with the household, its primary meeting place.</p>
<p>Over time, these roles became formalized and gave birth to models of leadership like those we see in Rome in the writings of Clement with his promotion of the elder-deacon model, or in the writings of Ignatius promoting the threefold bishop-elder-deacon model of leadership.</p>
<p>Because these roles ensured the smooth operation of the community along with a higher degree of stability, they formed the templated pattern of organization that later became a formalized, rigid hierarchy consisting of a single bishop ruling over a collection of house churches with a council of elders and administrative deacons.</p>
<p>Over time, the clearly biblical roles and functions of apostle (and prophet and evangelist for that matter) are referred to less and less as the more operative, somewhat more bureaucratic approaches to leadership replace them.</p>
<p>Here are the roots of the shepherd-teacher hegemony.</p>

<p>Campbell, The Elders: Seniority Within Earliest Christianity (London: T&#x26;T Clark, 1994). notes 305 We see a hint of the beginnings of conflict in Acts 8 when Peter and John make a special trip to Samaria to lay hands on the Samarians to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Mush discussion swirls around this event and why the Holy Spirit was given to them in this way. A plausible explanation was that the gospel was beginning to stretch beyond the ethnic boundaries of Judaism, which would raise questions about the legitimacy of non-Jewish converts.</p>
<p>Peter and John go down to Samaria and lay hands on them to legitimize their conversion, communicating the authenticity and acceptance of the Samaritans into the Jesus movement.</p>
<p>However, the conversion of Cornelius would stretch their views of who was allowed to enter the kingdom.</p>
<p>Instead of the apostles playing a significant role in the legitimization of the conversion of a new people group through the laying on of hands, the Holy Spirit moved separate and apart from them and legitimized the Gentiles’ status as having equal rights to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>We are deeply indebted to Martin Robinson, the key British missiologist, for many suggestions for this list.</p>
<p>The issue of apostolic women is complex because they tend to be more hidden and require more research to uncover.</p>
<p>In addition, the limitations placed on women by the wider society means that it is harder to point to them as founding movements and easier to see their moral and practical influence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some female movement leaders are in this list. K.J.A.</p>
