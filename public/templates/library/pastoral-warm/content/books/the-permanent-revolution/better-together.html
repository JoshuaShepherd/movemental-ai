<h1>Better Together</h1>
<p>The idea of a life-sharing community which is much more than a human association of the like-minded, a mutual insurance of common interest, and more too than the sum of its several parts and members, is essential to Christianity.</p>
<p>—R.E.O. White</p>
<p>Mark Conner, a friend and a leader of Citi Life Church in Melbourne, Australia, is deeply committed to building his leaders into a team that appreciates and values each other's differences and unique perspectives.</p>
<p>Here is one of the team exercises he uses illustrates the importance of diversity: he places an object (say, a statue) in the middle of a round table and asks people to share what they see.</p>
<p>He notes that three things happen.</p>
<p>First, everyone sees the object differently.</p>
<p>Second, no one sees it accurately because each one sees it from where he or she sits.</p>
<p>And finally, the only way everyone can see it accurately is when each person listens to everyone else’s perspective.</p>
<p>Without multiple perspectives, this exercise shows, we cannot develop an accurate view of the challenges and opportunities in front of us.</p>
<p>This is true in every area of life and ministry—for problem solving, decision making, vision creation, and strategic planning. 56 the permanent revolution</p>
<p>It was the pioneering leadership studies guru W.C.H.</p>
<p>Prentice who once noted that leaders succeed because they have learned two basic lessons: people are complex, and people are different.</p>
<p>That is precisely the reason it is important to enlist the motivation and active participation of everyone in an organization.1 Honoring diversity positions the leader to tap into the vast unused, largely dormant reservoirs of human capital.</p>
<p>This point applies directly to the APEST model.</p>
<p>To function primarily out of a constricted shepherd/teacher (ST) model ignores a vast surplus of spiritual and human capital contained within the apostolic/ prophetic/evangelist (APE) ministries.</p>
<p>If we reactivate the potential of APEST, it will not just revolutionize our understanding of the church; it will position us for the permanent revolution that Jesus intended (Ephesians 4:12–16).</p>
<p>In Chapter One, we made a case that APEST is in fact an extension of the ministry of Christ through the body of Christ.</p>
<p>So it should not be surprising that each of the APEST typologies brings out different aspects of the gospel itself.</p>
<p>For instance, prophets tend to gravitate toward definitions of the gospel that focus on covenant faithfulness, justice, and restoration.</p>
<p>Shepherds highlight forgiveness, healing, and perhaps the communal aspects of the work of Christ.</p>
<p>Teachers likely focus on the implications for worldview and ideological perspective.</p>
<p>Evangelists, true to their calling to be recruiters, catalysts, and the bearers of good news, emphasize the call to trust in Jesus, be saved, and to give one’s life to his cause.</p>
<p>Apostles highlight the seminal nature of the gospel and how it informs and motivates the church.</p>
<p>Each ministry vocation acts like a facet of the gospel’s diamond, and each brings a unique perspective, insight, and contribution to the life of the church.</p>
<p>While our understanding of the gospel is enriched by our various vocational perspectives, it will also be constricted by the narrowing concerns and perspectives of each individual calling.</p>
<p>The ministry of the church is meant to be multifaceted; when each perspective is taken on its own, divorced from the rest, and perceived to be the whole, a one-dimensional and incomplete understanding of the gospel will result.</p>
<p>Many of the battles of the church can be understood as stemming from this inability to see a theological issue from a broader perspective.2</p>
<p>Each ministry brings its own unique contribution to the task of the church; it can also be said that each brings out the different qualities of the other.</p>
<p>In dealing with issues related to foundational ministries, we better together 57 need to note that there are particular relationships and synergies latent in the partnerships between the apostolic and the other two marginalized ministries: the prophetic and the evangelistic.</p>
<p>This explores the uniqueness of these connections.</p>
<p>We begin by looking at the close association of the prophet and the apostle.</p>
<p>Prophetic Intelligence for Apostolic Architecture Paul declares in both explicit teaching and implicit modeling (which is the way he operates) that the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Ephesians 2:20).3 As you will no doubt guess, for similar hermeneutical reasons used in Ephesians 4, we reject the traditionalist, procrustean interpretation that this applies only to the original apostles and prophets.4 There is clearly a partnership between the two that moves beyond a random pairing to something essential for the ongoing, foundational health of the movement itself.</p>
<p>Two obvious questions come to mind.</p>
<p>Why this is the case?</p>
<p>And how do these two ministries relate to one another?</p>
<p>Edge Workers Inc.</p>
<p>We can see an essential as well as functional relationship between apostles and prophets in the New Testament:</p>
<p>Acts 13:1–4</p>
<p>Indicates the role that prophets played in key apostolic decisions.</p>
<p>Acts 15:32</p>
<p>Prophets affirm what God is doing in the Gentile mission in Antioch.</p>
<p>Acts 15:40</p>
<p>Paul partners with the prophet Silas.</p>
<p>Acts 21:8–11</p>
<p>Paul receives prophetic guidance and warning (Agabus).</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:20</p>
<p>Paul’s central affirmation that the church is “built on the foundations of apostles and prophets” substantiates what was common practice and observation in the Jesus movement.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11</p>
<p>Affirms the essentially fivefold nature of the church’s ministry.</p>
<p>12:28</p>
<p>Indicates the foundational role of apostles and prophets (listed first) in relation to the other gifts.</p>
<p>58 the permanent revolution</p>
<p>We think that part of the explanation for this persistent link between prophets and apostles is found in their similar roles of being generators of new forms of thinking and doing: both are generative forms of ministry.</p>
<p>And both end up raising uncomfortable questions about the status quo but for different reasons.</p>
<p>Their respective visions differ in nature; one is grounded in holy discontent and arises out of the demand of faithfulness to God, the other grounded in the urgency arising from the missio Dei (that is, the missionary God, the sent and sending One) and the integrity of the church as its key agency.</p>
<p>As we shall explore in great detail later in the book, there is an intrinsically entrepreneurial orientation in the apostolic calling—an aptitude that enables apostles to generate innovative ways to resolve problems and exploit new opportunities.</p>
<p>But theologically, there is a world of difference between simply pursuing a great idea for the wrong reasons and pursuing a good idea for the right reasons.</p>
<p>This is where the prophetic function so naturally complements the apostolic function: because of their spiritual sensitivity, prophets provide the necessary guidance and accountability so that the apostolic person might engage in authentic missional innovation and not simply entrepreneurialism for its own sake.</p>
<p>This squares completely with our own experience in the broader church as well as personally.</p>
<p>For instance Debra, Alan’s wife, is constantly bringing a prophetic challenge and viewpoint to Alan’s more apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>It certainly is foundational to movements like New Covenant Ministries International in setting up what they call apostolic-prophetic teams.</p>
<p>Recall what we said in the Chapter Two about the nature of prophetic intelligence (see Figure 2.1): that prophets sense the gap between God’s vision for the world and the status quo, and they call us to narrow the gap in the name of faithfulness to God and his cause.</p>
<p>Just as prophets have a high level of intolerance for gaps between value and reality, so apostles are intolerant of passivity in the face of the challenge to fulfill their calling as church in the world.</p>
<p>This makes them want to work to help close the gap that the prophets intuit (see Figure 2.1).</p>
<p>Add to this their natural aptitudes for pioneering and their sense of sentness, and it is clear that they are distinctly missional entrepreneurs.5 This apostolic-entrepreneurial connection with prophetic intelligence is illustrated in Figure 3.1.</p>
<p>Apostolic people naturally pursue the opportunities, but prophets ensure that they take the right pathway to get there.</p>
<p>The prophet, in other words, provides the necessary intelligence to guide apostolic decision making, direction, and design.</p>
<p>By asking the right questions and calling for faithfulness to God’s intent, purpose, and design, prophets play a crucial role in keeping the church on track.6 This type of relationship is confirmed through countless conversations we have had with partnerships between better together 59</p>
<p>God’s Values and Reality apostolic and prophetic people.</p>
<p>Certainly it is true to my (Alan’s) experience with Debra.</p>
<p>Her prophetic intuition and warnings to me have been profound in helping guide my apostolically leaning ministry.</p>
<p>Tim has similar experiences with his wife, who is also prophetic in nature.</p>
<p>No leadership function is designed to function alone.</p>
<p>Because of their catalytic role in the system, apostles especially need the other ministry vocations to be able to operate in a humble, mature, and efficient way.</p>
<p>And prophets, because they are sensitive to God and his values, are best equipped to play this unique role with apostles.</p>
<p>They serve to call apostolic entrepreneurialism away from pragmatism toward true faithfulness.</p>
<p>This is clearly evident in the New Testament itself, and it squares with experience in both historical and contemporary movements.7 New Covenant Ministries International places the apostle-prophet relationship at the heart of the movement’s approach to mission.8 For instance, it requires that all new church planting projects be started by a team of apostles and prophets.</p>
<p>It is also a methodological cornerstone for members of the Order of Mission, the international missional network of which Mike Breen is the senior guardian.</p>
<p>By building APEST into its lifeshapes system—a formation process that lies at the very basis of the organization’s approach—it ensures that these relationships are rightly understood and honored.9</p>
<p>Going Out, Going Deep</p>
<p>There is another way to understand the nature of the apostolic and prophetic as being foundational and in inextricable partnership.</p>
<p>As we have seen, prophets reproach all forms of superficiality, especially when it comes to God and the things he is concerned with. A major characteristic of prophetic ministry therefore is a call to go deep, to identify 60 the permanent revolution with culture and place through participation in the local rhythms of that context.</p>
<p>It is because of this call to depth that the prophetic ministry is best associated with the incarnational aspects of mission.</p>
<p>Incarnational approaches also require that we go deep, take culture seriously, and go to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, incarnational ministry requires prophetic patience and attentiveness to what God is already doing in neighborhoods and people’s lives, and it honors the need for justice and shalom among peoples.</p>
<p>This is the very stuff of biblical prophecy.</p>
<p>As the person delegated with guardianship over the missional (sent by God and sending agency) impulse, the apostolic is vocationally responsible for maintaining the outgoing impulses of the church.</p>
<p>These two impulses—the missional (going out) and the incarnational (going deep)—associated as they are with the respective ministries of apostles and prophets provide two vital dimensions for a foundation for ecclesia (Figure 3.2).</p>
<p>One demands breadth and extension, and the other requires depth and rootedness.</p>
<p>They are the warp and woof of mission</p>
<p>Mission Impulse: Going Out (Apostolic Driver)</p>
<p>Context for the Establishment of</p>
<p>Ecclesia as a Sustainable Movement Incarnational Impulse: Going Deep (Prophetic Driver) better together 61 and together create the foundations on which movements are built.</p>
<p>The connection between the apostolic and prophetic goes beyond their vocational chemistry as outliers: they combine to provide the movement with its most basic support structure: the foundation.</p>
<p>As the apostle goes forward, the prophet helps keep the apostle grounded in God’s reality and provides critical feedback through questions and observations.</p>
<p>As the prophet goes deep, the apostle reminds the prophet of the grander missional objectives of extension and multiplication.</p>
<p>Without the apostle, there would be no real movement or extension, and the church might drift into a socialized gospel that has little regard for the missional objective of catalyzing movements, disciple making, and church planting.</p>
<p>But without the prophet, the movement might tend to become shallow and lack the spiritual funding required to transform its host environments radically.</p>
<p>Apostles and prophets are both foundational and work best in reflexive environments where each is supported and challenged by the other.</p>
<p>The dialectic between the two ministries is thus vital for the health and sustainability of ecclesia as movement.</p>
<p>The new monastic movement associated with Shane Claiborne, Jonathan Wilson Hartgrove, and Scott Bessenecker, for example, tends toward the prophetic-incarnational, while the church planting movements associated with Mike Breen of 3DM, Neil Cole of Church Multiplication Associates, and Jeff Vanderstelt of Soma Communities, among others, tend to the apostolic-missional.</p>
<p>Missional-incarnational movements seek to combine the two impulses’ understanding that each is a correlative of the other.</p>
<p>Ensuring Growth: Avoiding the Iron Law of Involution Having explored something of the special relationship of the apostolic and the prophetic, it is necessary to probe into the largely unexplored relationship between the two ministries that are most responsible for church growth and movement extension: the apostolic and the evangelistic.</p>
<p>How are they similar, how are they different, and how can we tell them apart?</p>
<p>One of the concepts in social movement theory is the iron law of involution, which maintains that because social movements (religious or otherwise) are strongly ideological and radical in nature, they need to achieve tangible outcomes in terms of their perceived mission or else face inevitable disintegration into sects and splinter institutions.10 Involution thus happens when a revolution recoils back on itself because it does not have the impact it seeks.</p>
<p>By fostering growth and 62 the permanent revolution achieving desired outcomes in their own ways, the apostolic and the evangelistic ministries work against the forces of social disintegration.</p>
<p>Instead of involution, which a system dominated by shepherds and teachers will likely produce, they maintain the impetus needed for a permanent revolution.11</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the so-called church growth movement was one the greatest movements of God in the past century, and it remains so.</p>
<p>Almost single-handedly, it has reversed the hemorrhaging of the church that had resulted from the loss of the evangelistic ministry and the stifling conservatism of mid-twentieth-century evangelicalism, and it has given the church a way through the corrosive effects of the secular, death-of-God theology of the 1960s.</p>
<p>The profoundly seminal thinking of missiologist Donald McGavran led to a thorough restructuring of the church by the many theorists and practitioners who came after him.</p>
<p>In effect, McGavran’s work was instrumental in reorganizing the church around the lost function of evangelism.</p>
<p>For instance, the “seeker-sensitive movements” of the 1980s and 1990s put evangelism at front and center of the church’s purpose in the world.</p>
<p>Gone was the church conceived purely as a teaching and pastoral center.</p>
<p>Gone was the outsourcing of evangelism to the many parachurches that had popped up in the twentieth century—Youth for Christ, Navigators, Campus Crusade, and the like.12 The local church took evangelism seriously again.</p>
<p>The age of the evangelist-leader was upon us, along with contemporary worship, the megachurches, and church outreach.</p>
<p>And it has been a remarkable phenomenon: tens of millions of people have been evangelized as a result.</p>
<p>The reason we raise this bit of history is to highlight not only the vital link between the two ministries (and there clearly are similarities) but also the important differences.</p>
<p>In our experience it appears that the two distinct ministries of apostle and evangelist, even when and where they are taken seriously, are almost always confused.</p>
<p>Loss of clarity in strategically important times and issues is always a problem.</p>
<p>So when evangelism is thought to be synonymous with apostolic ministry, not only is apostolic ministry effectively co-opted to the evangelistic (which is the more understood), but the possibility of the much-needed apostolic impact is seriously diminished by default.</p>
<p>This is not to minimize the critical ministry of the evangelist; rather, we mean to help contribute to the church’s understanding of apostolic ministry, which is devastatingly underdeveloped.</p>
<p>Clearly this confusion needs to be cleared up if we are to reengage apostolic ministry in our churches. better together 63</p>
<p>Understanding the Differences Between Apostles and Evangelists</p>
<p>To truly understand the meaning and impact of both apostolic and evangelist ministries and their interrelationship, we need to understand how they are different.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main differences as we see them.</p>
<p>The core apostolic task (not an office) is to extend Christianity as a whole.</p>
<p>As the primary custodian of the DNA of the church, apostles are called to advance the cause as an integrated faith system, as well as establish it in new contexts.</p>
<p>Evangelists, on the other hand, are recruiters to the cause: they are gifted with the ability to catalyze faith in Jesus and thereby gain new adherents to the movement.</p>
<p>Apostles and evangelists are therefore different in motivation and outcome.</p>
<p>Apostles almost always catalyze movement primarily through mission and church planting, whereas evangelists create church growth by adding people to the movement through conversions.</p>
<p>The impact is clearly different.</p>
<p>For instance, when Bill Hybels is on record as stating that Willow Creek does not do church planting, he is indicating that his primary vision and motivation is evangelistic, not apostolic.</p>
<p>This certainly does not diminish his leadership and influence; it simply qualifies it.</p>
<p>He is possibly one of the greatest evangelistic leaders of our age and leads one of the most influential movements, but that does not mean he is apostolic.</p>
<p>One of the clearest pointers of authentic apostolic ministry, particularly Pauline versions, is church planting.</p>
<p>Organizational Design—Addition or Multiplication?</p>
<p>Although both evangelistic and apostolic leadership are growth oriented, they tend to design the systems they lead differently because of the differences in calling, motivation, and technique.</p>
<p>The evangelistic person tends to design an organization that will transfer the message en masse as well as well incorporate additional converts to the community.</p>
<p>The apostolic person will likely design in order to mobilize converts into the ongoing mission and to extend the church’s reach.</p>
<p>Viewed in terms of orientation, the one is centripetal and the other centrifugal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if evangelistic ministry (because it primarily focuses on winning individuals to faith a decision at a time) is by nature additional, then it can be said that an apostolic ministry (because it is concerned with movement) is by nature exponential.</p>
<p>For instance, we believe that the American megachurch is largely the result of evangelistic approaches and leadership because it was the direct result of the church’s taking evangelism seriously.</p>
<p>It has brought 64 the permanent revolution millions of new converts into the church, but then it did not quite know what to do with them once they were baptized, so it simply reframed previous notions of the size of the local church and then managed the outcomes.13 Willow Creek’s Reveal study, which understood through research into the capacity of Willow Creek Association to produce mature disciples, pretty much admits this.</p>
<p>Seeker-sensitive approaches have a huge evangelistic impact, but it is not as effective in terms of maturing and releasing disciples into the missional purposes of God for their lives.</p>
<p>Those in the church growth movement came under more distinctly apostolic influences when they became inspired by the concept of exponential growth and multiplication and reproducibility.</p>
<p>In other words, multisite thinking and church planting movements were a direct result of more apostolic approaches to ministry.</p>
<p>Having chosen that math of multiplication, the trajectory is set in a decidedly apostolic direction when the church is conceived of as a genuine people movement where everyone is empowered (discipled) as an agent of the church’s mission.</p>
<p>In apostolic perspective, effectiveness is measured not by weekend attendance (as in contemporary churches) but by the church’s capacity to multiply its impact by church planting as well as activating the APEST gifts and human capital inherent in the church.</p>
<p>An example of this shift became evident in a conversation that I (Alan) had with a senior leader in a church with five thousand members.</p>
<p>He said that rather than simply adding one new location or campus to the church, the leaders’ job was to help every member see that he or she is a location.</p>
<p>This is multisite thinking conceived in a completely different light.</p>
<p>Mike Breen can recall the exact moment his world shifted from an evangelistic design to an apostolic one:</p>
<p>I was in a time of prayer, leading a megachurch at the time and one of the largest in the country, and God seemed to visit me in a very specific way.</p>
<p>He was able to show me the whole of the community and he seemed to say, “You know, you can have the whole megachurch thing.</p>
<p>Or you can have something else.” That something else was that the Lord gave me this vision for a continually reproducible network of lightweight and low-maintenance communities (which led to the innovation of lay-led, midsized missional communities).</p>
<p>We wouldn’t simply grow by adding people to worship services; we’d grow by multiplying disciples who could then multiply missional communities, who could multiply worshipping campuses who could multiply churches and into other networks and cities.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be seeing new people come to faith better together 65 and discipling them by addition but by multiplication.</p>
<p>What I’ve seen with St Thomas Sheffield in the U.K. and the churches we’ve begun to work with in the United States with 3DM is this dramatic shift from adding to one place to multiplying everything on every level. I remember thinking that I’d never seen anything like it and I wouldn’t even know what we’d call such a thing.</p>
<p>It was something completely new and innovative.</p>
<p>It was so different from the other “models” of church that I had seen or embraced.</p>
<p>An example of this shift from evangelistic to apostolic design is demonstrated by our friend and collaborator Dave Ferguson and the New Thing Network.</p>
<p>As a multisite megachurch and a church planting movement, they are reconceiving the whole system from an apostolic perspective.</p>
<p>It also describes what is happening in the many megachurches involved in the Future Travelers’ learning journey: using existing platforms to launch movements that have global reach.14</p>
<p>Orbits of Influence</p>
<p>Another difference between apostolic and evangelistic ministry can be detected by observing their natural orbits, or zones, of influence and impact.</p>
<p>Although a historical case can be made for itinerant evangelists who roam far and wide, it seems that most evangelists operate in close relationship and proximity to a local congregation or movement.</p>
<p>Remember that evangelists are basically recruiters to the cause; they have to have a strong relational link and commitment to the cause they so ardently promote.</p>
<p>They also have strong relational links to non-Christian people in the broader community.</p>
<p>Their gift exists in making the connection among gospel, converts, and the local community of believers.</p>
<p>In this way, they act somewhat like worker bees, collecting pollen and bringing it back for processing in the hive.</p>
<p>Evangelists are by nature attractional: they act as doorways for new people to come into the ecclesial community.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the impact of their ministry and calling, evangelists are unlikely to wander too far from home base; they are what we call supralocal.</p>
<p>Because of a lack of a meaningful theological thinking on the topic, most American church leaders make the mistake of associating being entrepreneurial with apostolic ministry, that is, someone who is entrepreneurial is also apostolic.</p>
<p>Certainly evangelists can also be highly entrepreneurial 66 the permanent revolution and culturally inventive.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurialism is a skill that can serve all the APEST functions, but it does not take the same form in all of them.</p>
<p>It is a categorical mistake to assume entrepreneurial people are automatically apostolic.</p>
<p>Both mice and elephants have four legs, a tail, and a mouth, but they are clearly not the same animal.</p>
<p>Apparent similarities can be deceptive.</p>
<p>Culture Creators, Engagers, and Redeemers At first glance, it would seem that all the church needs to do in order to address the decline of Christianity in the West is to reactivate its evangelistic people.</p>
<p>And as we have seen, evangelism certainly has brought renewal and growth to the church over the past forty years.</p>
<p>But given that evangelists usually function in an attractional way within the cultural orbit of the church, their effectiveness decreases the further they move from their cultural base.</p>
<p>This has some serious implications for a church that finds itself increasingly stranded in a context that now requires a distinctly missional approach.</p>
<p>Using an evangelistic strategy in a missional situation can create as many problems as it resolves.</p>
<p>In On the Verge, Dave Ferguson and I (Alan) suggest that for most of history, churches in the West have perceived themselves as the privileged religion of Western civilization—effectively a civil religion.</p>
<p>The churchstate alliance in Europe and the associated church-culture alliance in the United States have granted Christianity a privileged status.</p>
<p>It has created the situation where, except for some dissenting minorities, most people are automatically considered to be Christian and have some direct, albeit nominal, association with the church.</p>
<p>In other words, these countries have had a churched culture for almost seventeen centuries.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the church can assume that most people have a relationship with it, and all they need to do is some convincing to appropriate the claims of Christ more thoroughly.</p>
<p>If people are not coming to church, all we need is to do some evangelism, and they will.</p>
<p>We have not seen the need to do any cross-cultural translation of the gospel normally required of missionaries going to completely non-Christian cultures.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Western church now finds itself in an increasingly dechurched, and now genuinely unchurched, society.</p>
<p>We can no longer assume that simple evangelistic outreach will work.</p>
<p>In fact, this may well be the source of much of our crisis in the church.</p>
<p>Given that we are now in a missionary situation in the West, we have to employ missional (that is, apostolic) approaches to resolve a distinctly missionary problem.15 Simply applying an evangelistic solution to a missionary problem will be a big category error, especially in a time that requires theological clarity and decisive strategy.</p>

<p>To help resolve the problems, we need to incorporate apostolic imagination and practice back into the churches’ self-concept and strategies, one that goes beyond the more evangelistic approach of addition to include the more exponential approach of the apostolic.</p>
<p>Table 3.1 highlights some further differences between the apostolic and evangelistic ministries.</p>
<p>The Spatial Profiles of APEST We believe that it is important to explore the range of influence normally associated with each type of ministry.</p>
<p>What is the natural orbit of influence for each ministry, and how can we ensure that this influence is focused and maximized to benefit the overall mission of the church?</p>
<p>These questions will have importance in understanding the distinction between generative and operative forms of leadership later in this book.</p>
<p>We suggest that shepherds and teachers are most at home within a definite cultural and geographical locality.</p>
<p>We have already noted that good shepherds will likely experience diminished influence to the degree 68 the permanent revolution that they cannot recall the names and stories of the people in their care.</p>
<p>Shepherds therefore must be very attentive to the local and the particular.</p>
<p>Although perhaps somewhat less localized than shepherds, teachers are best suited to situations that encourage attentiveness and personal engagement.</p>
<p>At least organizationally, they have tended to prefer stable environments suited to educational purposes such as the seminary.</p>
<p>Evangelists typically operate within the broader cultural and geographical boundaries of the organization (that is, they are supralocal).</p>
<p>This means that they are often found venturing out of the strict confines of the local ecclesia.</p>
<p>This distance has geographical dimensions, but it is best seen in cultural terms.</p>
<p>Evangelists go in and out of the community, but they typically do not venture too far beyond their base cultural framework.16 They are seldom cross-cultural missionaries but rather act as doorways into the local community of faith.</p>
<p>The very nature of the prophetic ministry requires some spiritual distance from the more parochial interests of the local community so that it can be addressed and called to repentance and change.</p>
<p>Prophets need critical distance from the community in order to speak and act objectively.17 Withdrawing from the center and moving toward the edge does more than create space for listening to God; it also affords prophets a certain level of objectivity that those who are more absorbed in the life of the community do not enjoy.</p>
<p>As covenant people, however, prophets feel bound to the people of God in love and can never be too distant lest they damage their capacity to speak with love and commitment.</p>
<p>Richard Rohr says that prophets are at their best “on the edge of the inside.”18</p>
<p>Apostles, because of the missionary calling, are the most distant from the epicenter of a movement.</p>
<p>Their pioneering and adventuresome nature propels them beyond the cultural and geographical boundaries of the local community into new contexts.</p>
<p>Although not always cross-cultural, they are likely to deal with the engagement of Christianity at the edges of the church.</p>
<p>Peter and Paul are a case in point. (In Chapter Seven, we compare and contrast the ministries of these two archetypal apostles and show how these in turn are exemplary for other forms of apostolic ministry.)</p>
<p>Because the vocations of shepherds and teachers are appropriate for an established community, they are best characterized as being integrative and operative.</p>
<p>They are natural integrators who help with the assimilation of people and information throughout the community.19 They are also operative because they are more inclined to drive the routine aspects of running and maintaining the community or organization than charting a new course.</p>
<p>They optimize efficiency and resourcefulness rather than generate new forms. better together 69</p>
<h2>S T</h2>
<h2>E P</h2>
<p>A</p>
<p>Operative-Integrative Generative-Adaptive</p>
<p>Because evangelists, prophets, and apostles typically function within and beyond the more parochial interests of the local ecclesia, we suggest that these ministries are best characterized by the terms generative and adaptive (see Figure 3.3).</p>
<p>They are generative because of the effect they have on both the local community and the development of Christianity as a whole.</p>
<p>As ministries that operate toward the edge, away from the center of the organization, they provide the center with new insights necessary for organization learning and for an authentic missional encounter with their environment.</p>
<p>They are adaptive because their capacity to function effectively away from the center demonstrates an innate ability to adapt to diverse, chaotic, and often complex environments.</p>
<p>The center is significantly more routine and predictable than at the edges.</p>
<p>Pioneers and Settlers A good way to understand the spatial and relational dimensions of APEST is to use the metaphor of pioneers and settlers.</p>
<p>If we view the church as the primary agent of God’s purposes in this world, his elect 70 the permanent revolution community that is called to both embody and extend the kingdom of God in human affairs, then we can see why we need the activities of both pioneers and settlers.</p>
<p>Pioneers by nature take on the challenge to go to places and contexts that others have not explored.</p>
<p>In many ways, this tracks the work of the kingdom of God as it expresses itself far beyond the confines of Christianity.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, God is the archetypal pioneer: He is involved in the lives of all people, seeking to call them to himself in and through Jesus.</p>
<p>The church, specifically the pioneer, joins him in this mission.</p>
<p>Pioneers seek the journey.</p>
<p>However, hard-core pioneers particularly are more likely to keep on moving, continuing to open up new territory than to stop and build.</p>
<p>Unless they are accompanied by people more given to settling new territory, much of the gain can be lost.</p>
<p>Settlers, on the other hand, care deeply about guarding and maintaining the ground that the pioneers have gained, thus making sure it stays under the reign of God.</p>
<p>Settlers ask and seek to answer a number of questions:</p>
<p>It is good that new ground has been gained and that people have come to know Jesus, but will the lives of these people be better?</p>
<p>Will there be transformation?</p>
<p>Will they be living into the reality of the kingdom?</p>
<p>Will the Word become incarnated into their lives?</p>
<p>However, settlers by nature can become so settled that they are resistant to moving forward or embracing change.</p>
<p>If we do not learn to manage the inherent tensions between pioneering and settling, we can end up damaging the missional fabric of the church.</p>
<p>Pioneers will look to move forward into the frontier, while the settlers will look to stay behind and maintain the establishment.</p>
<p>What can ensue from this tension to go in different directions is a breaking away of the pioneering types from the settler types, fracturing the organic structure of the body (Figure 3.4).</p>
<p>In many ways, maintaining APEST dynamics, with built-in biases toward either pioneering or settling, is vital to the missional fitness of the movement as a whole.</p>
<p>Both forces are necessary.</p>
<p>Leadership must learn to manage, and even harness, these tensions to deliver effective mission. better together 71</p>
<p>We often think that church ought to be a place with no tensions.</p>
<p>But this sentiment creates a false sense of harmony that works against the purposes of God and his kingdom: to gain and then maintain the ground won through pioneering and settling.</p>
<p>In fact, a false sense of peace, based as it is on passive aggression, will eventually create more conflict and will threaten the church’s capacity for fulfilling its task, as we can see in most church splits.</p>
<p>Organizational psychologists Kenwyn Smith and David Berg say it this way: “It is indeed a paradox that while the existence of conflict and opposition threatens a group’s life, the absence of the same forces is also a serious threat.</p>
<p>Emotionally, a group that does not provide room for the conflicting and ambivalent reactions evoked by group life is not a place where either the individuals or the group as a whole can thrive.”20</p>
<p>Contained within APEST are competing values and interests.</p>
<p>Therefore, left to their own impulses, each of the ministries will seek to delegitimize the others.</p>
<p>They will seek to alleviate tension by eliminating its perceived source or isolating themselves from the others.</p>
<p>The historical pattern (see Chapter Six and the Appendix) is that the more destabilizing, generative forms of ministry (the APEs) end up getting edited out of the equation by the more stabilizing ST types.</p>
<p>There is no conspiracy theory here.</p>
<p>Homeostasis ensures a tendency to oversimplify and ignore the inherent complexity that comes with diversity.</p>
<p>There is a part of us that finds shelter in overly simplified understandings of people, organizations, and the world.</p>
<p>This is very true when it comes to the pioneer-settler tension inherent in APEST.</p>
<p>Without pioneers, we rarely, if ever, gain new territory.</p>
<p>Without settlers (what 3DM now calls “developers”) we rarely, if ever, keep the new territory.</p>
<p>We need to allow the tension to be creative, not destructive.</p>
<p>By placing a high value on both and ensuring that both groups learn to operate together to advance the kingdom, we develop missional fitness that can extend the kingdom and maintain health along the way.21 72 the permanent revolution</p>
<p>In the left diagram of Figure 3.5, we see settlers leading out but they never reach the frontier.</p>
<p>In the middle diagram, the pioneers are pushing toward the frontier, but because settlers are not there to develop the new ground, they end up losing it.</p>
<p>The right diagram of the figure indicates a better congruence between the two forces of pioneering and settling: as they work together, both are able to penetrate and maintain a new frontier.</p>
<p>A Missional Dialectic This chapter has sought to draw out some of the rich relationships and differences that exist within the APEST typology of ministry.</p>
<p>It has not been exhaustive by any means.</p>
<p>In fact, an exploration of the various possibilities that arise with different combinations opens up new vistas on ministry in and through God’s people.</p>
<p>But unlocking these potentials must begin with a viable acceptance of the legitimacy and space of the other.</p>
<p>Perhaps a good way to close this chapter is by highlighting the profoundly adaptive potentials inherent in a fully fledged APEST ministry.</p>
<p>Progress in any arena of life always involves a tension between the forces of progression and the forces of conservatism.</p>
<p>Thesis leads to antithesis and then to synthesis.</p>
<p>Every automobile needs both brakes and accelerators—to have only one would render it ineffective.</p>
<p>In fact, life itself requires stability (but not too much) and adaptation to changing environment (but not too much) in order to be healthy, invigorating, and sustainable.</p>
<p>Clearly these tensions exist with the fivefold typology of Ephesians 4:11.</p>
<p>The healthy, mutually enriching, but always tense relationship between the prophet and all the others is vital for spiritual health.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the partnership of apostle and prophet is important in the Ephesians 2:20 dynamics of laying the right foundations in the church.</p>
<p>Both need to collaborate, as well as tussle at times, in helping the church to grow in adherents and extend to new territory.</p>
<p>In the church, the pioneer needs the settler, and vice versa, if we are going to live under the Lordship of Jesus and be the kind of movement that he intended in the first place.</p>
<p>Truly we are better together than we are apart.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must seriously strive for the unity of the Spirit in the bond of true peace (Ephesians 4:3), recognizing that we are very different and that Jesus intended that we should be (Ephesians 4:7–11) and so become the mature and transformative church that lives under the rule of Jesus (Ephesians 4:12–16). ‌Missional Ministry for a Missional Church a church where everyone gets to play</p>
