<h1>Conclusion: The Mission Has a Church</h1>
<p>The ongoing renewal of Christianity is tied to the health and presence of apostolic ministry in its Pauline and Petrine expressions.</p>
<p>Apostolic ministry is not just about starting new movements but also about continually reforming, reviving, and propelling the church toward its missional calling.</p>
<p>Without these functions, the ministry mix of the church is impoverished, and its ability to thrive diminishes.</p>

<h2>The Nature of Mission and Renewal</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is not so much that the church has a mission but that the mission has a church."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To define Christian mission purely on human terms is theologically inaccurate and misunderstands its nature: mission is rooted in the being and purposes of God.</p>
<p>As God's people, our task is to discern what God is doing and to join Him.</p>
<p>This perspective shifts the focus from the Church crafting its own mission, to understanding that the mission of God precedes and empowers the Church itself.</p>
<h2>Rediscovering the Primal Purpose</h2>
<p>Being the Church that Jesus intended involves participating in God’s eternal purposes for the world.</p>
<p>Renewal is more than merely reinventing ourselves; it is about rediscovering the primal power of the Spirit and the gospel already present in the Church’s life—reconnecting with our purpose and recovering forgotten ways.</p>
<p>This potential has always existed but has often been overshadowed by layers of tradition, ritual, dogma, and worldliness.</p>
<p>Robert Quinn refers to the rediscovery of our foundational scripts as “discerning the inner voice of the organization,” describing this inner voice as the organization’s moral center.</p>
<p>He asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[The] articulation of the inner voice of an organization is often the first step toward revitalizing [an organization] and uncovering a vision filled with resonance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than concocting a mission from scratch, we must listen again to the Church's inner voice, reconnect with our defining scripts, and re-engage with our deepest sense of meaning.</p>
<h2>Petrine Apostleship and Organizational Renewal</h2>
<p>Petrine approaches to renewal do not impose a new purpose on their members; instead, they help them rediscover their purpose and train them to listen for the organization’s inner voice.</p>
<p>While realigning with this inner voice may threaten the institution’s status quo—often built on self-preservation—it is essential for the ongoing vitality and legitimacy of the Christian movement.</p>
<p>Lawrence Cada, in his study of religious orders, describes the “founding charism” as an order’s unique, gospel-transformed vision of the world.</p>
<p>The use of charism (grace) highlights that an organization's purpose is fundamentally a gift—a divine bequest unique to each organization.</p>
<p>Recovering this gift means a "return to the sources." Apostolic refounding, therefore, is fundamentally about this return.</p>
<p>Organizational renewal is the process of discovering an organization’s true identity and mission.</p>
<p>The authority for transformation comes not from leaders or groups, but from God’s calling.</p>
<p>The key to revitalizing religious organizations is to recover and reappropriate their founding charism.</p>
<p>Dallas Willard encourages younger leaders to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Stir the primal coals of your movement, do what they did, say what they said."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a call to be radical traditionalists—not as a blind return to conventionality, but as an innovative reinterpretation of the founding charism for contemporary expression.</p>
<h3>Radical Traditionalism: Continuity and Innovation</h3>
<p>Consider Volkswagen’s reinvention of the Beetle or the Mini: while these vehicles retain continuity with their origins, they are also radically new.</p>
<p>This kind of radical traditionalism is also seen in religious renewal movements—such as the return to Wesleyan roots in Methodism or the charismatic renewal within mainline denominations in the 1980s.</p>
<p>All apostolic ministry involves this return to the founding message, reinterpreted into new contexts.</p>
<p>Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, in their work on organizational dynamics, advise us to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Preserve the core and stimulate progress."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Revitalization requires both continuity and discontinuity—a conservative dimension and a radical one.</p>
<p>Radical traditionalism involves rediscovering the founder’s vision and matching it with innovation.</p>
<h2>Renewal with a Long Tail</h2>
<p>Both Pauline founding and Petrine refounding require crafting and living into new organizational practices and rhythms anchored in foundational principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recentering the Church on its Christological roots</li>
<li>Developing robust discipleship processes</li>
<li>Creating leadership development pathways</li>
<li>Forging new approaches to mission</li>
<li>Shaping organizational structure for purpose-fit</li>
<li>Overcoming risk aversion</li>
</ul>
<p>Because apostolic work is foundational, its most important results often lie beneath the surface, sometimes unnoticeable for long periods.</p>
<p>Many fail at this stage not due to a lack of ideas or resources, but due to a lack of perseverance and courage.</p>
<h3>The “Flywheel Effect”</h3>
<p>Jim Collins describes organizational progress as a “flywheel effect”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In building a great organization, there is no single defining action...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather, it feels like turning a giant, heavy flywheel.</p>
<p>Pushing with great effort—days, weeks and months of work, with almost imperceptible progress—you finally get the flywheel to inch forward.</p>
<p>Each turn builds upon previous work, compounding your investment of effort.</p>
<p>This is how you build greatness."</p>
<p>Apparent successes tend to have a long, unspectacular prehistory.</p>
<p>For example, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese church after the Maoist revolution was built on foundational, apostolic groundwork laid generations before.</p>
<h3>Laying Deep Foundations</h3>
<p>This “long tail” echoes Jesus’s teachings on the kingdom’s slow, subversive growth: seeds becoming trees, yeast leavening dough.</p>
<p>Initial insignificance—seen in Christ’s own ministry—may give way to great long-term impact.</p>
<p>Patient trust in core ideas (the “DNA”) is paramount.</p>
<h2>Adventures in the Borderlands</h2>
<p>Renewal is inherently dialogical, requiring both:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Reconnection with central, founding ideas 2.</p>
<p>Engagement at the organizational “edges”</p>
<p>The revitalizing move outward—into unknown territory—is essential.</p>
<p>Renewal often emerges through “surfing the edge of chaos,” a concept from living systems theory.</p>
<p>Engagement with the world forces the Church to interpret and translate its message, catalyzing theological and spiritual renewal driven from the margins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The main stimulus for the renewal of Christianity will come from the bottom and from the edge, from sectors of the Christian world that are on the margins."</p>
<p>—W. C. Roof</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, movements of mission outside the Church have generated inner renewal.</p>
<p>Systemic renewal seldom comes from disengagement or insularity.</p>
<h3>The Edge as the Site of Innovation</h3>
<p>Without borderland engagement, organizations become self-reinforcing and resistant to change.</p>
<p>Intelligence and decision-making are derived solely from inherited traditions, which eventually become sacrosanct and disconnected from present realities.</p>
<p>Real learning and renewal arise from a dialectic engagement—struggles at the edge, where new problems invite innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Donald Schön notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are those who choose the swampy lowlands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They deliberately involve themselves in messy but crucially important problems and, when asked to describe their methods of inquiry, they speak of experience, trial and error, intuition and muddling through."</p>
<p>Reflective practitioners who can translate hard-won, edge-derived wisdom into organizational learning are invaluable.</p>
<h2>Drawing Near to God, Taking It to the Streets</h2>
<p>Apostolic ministry mediates the vital dialectic of renewal: as “classic edge people,” apostles extend Christianity into new situations, ensuring that the gospel DNA is faithfully transmitted across contexts.</p>
<p>As guardians of the DNA, they safeguard foundational truths, recognizing that error at this level mutates all that follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Preserve the core and stimulate progress."</p>
<p>—Collins &#x26; Porras</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apostolic ministry is necessary not only for expanding the church’s reach but also for maintaining the health of its home base.</p>
<p>Founding any movement in a fallen world inevitably requires refounding.</p>
