<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>One of the most intriguing pieces of evidence that Western Christendom is over, or is rapidly disintegrating, is the emergence of a broad spectrum of initiatives to plant untraditional, postdenominational congregations in the Western cultures once self-defined as Christian.</p>
<p>These initiatives are enormously diverse, although they all share a commitment to experiment with forms and styles of community life that are clearly not beholden to the received traditions of the Western churches.</p>
<p>In terms of the practices and patterns of their gathered life, they are decidedly countercultural.</p>
<p>Although no defined theological consensus guides them or serves as their common ground, many of these initiatives are generating a biblical and theological engagement that is challenging and encouraging.</p>
<p>Convergence may be too strong a term for what is happening, but there is clearly a mutually constructive theological conversation emerging among theologians like Alan Hirsch, Michael Frost, Tim Catchim, and the participants in the missional church conversation.</p>
<p>This book is an important resource for that discussion and a motor to advance it further.</p>
<p>The term missional came into broad use after a small group of missiologists published Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America in 1998.1 The term immediately became a cliché that today means everything or nothing.</p>
<p>Its original sense, focusing on the essential purpose and character of the church as the called and sent instrument of God’s mission in the world, has been recognized and enriched by the work of such pioneer planters of post-Christendom Western indigenous churches (my term) as the authors of this book.</p>
<p>Alan Hirsch neatly summarized the thrust of the missional church proposal when he wrote in his The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A missional church is a church that defines itself, and organizes its life around its real purpose as an agent of God's mission to the world. In other words, the church's true and authentic organizing principle is mission. Therefore when the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In The Permanent Revolution, Alan Hirsch and Tim Catchim propose a revolutionary missional ecclesiology shaped by the New Testament account of the apostolic missionary strategy. From the outset, the Christian mission focused on the calling and forming of communities that would continue the witness to the person and work of Jesus Christ that had brought them into being. To reclaim that strategy, Hirsch and Catchim argue that the functions of Word ministry in Ephesians 4:11ff—apostolic, prophetic, evangelistic, pastoral, and teaching—are essential for the formation of authentic and faithful witnessing congregations. This emphasis is linked with a strong critique of Western Christendom's reduction of these essential functions to the last two: pastoral (or shepherd) and teaching. The problem of clericalism that results from that reduction is certainly one of the major and most daunting challenges that the Western Christian movement faces as it moves out of the protections of established Christendom.</p>
<p>Especially crucial for the missional ecclesiology today is the recovery of the apostolic function in the church. It is this ministry that ensures that the church is always centered on its calling to be the agent and instrument of God's mission and that everything it is and does relates to and demonstrates that calling. I share this conviction and have argued that the Nicene marks of the church need to be interpreted in the reverse order—apostolic, catholic, holy, and one—so that apostolicity defines every aspect of the life and action of the church. Only when apostolicity functions in that way can God's mission be served obediently.</p>
<p>In the missional church discussion, this conviction has been linked with the critique of Western ecclesiologies that replace the central and decisive theme of mission with various theologies of institutional maintenance. This book's focus on apostolicity clearly converges with this insistence that mission defines the church, and the authors' exposition of the practice of apostolicity broadens and deepens the discussion in truly generative ways.</p>
<p>Hirsch and Catchim persuasively argue their proposal of a revolutionary ecclesiology from many perspectives, exegetical and theological, as well as organizational and sociological. To flesh out the practice of apostolicity, they turn to diverse insights from the world of organizational behavior and leadership in Western cultures. This approach can be understood as an exercise in contextualization. It expounds the way in which apostolic ministry ought to work in Western cultures by calling on the research and analysis of corporate organizational behavior, which constantly generates new theories and interpretations. This leads to their "interesting conclusion that underscores the purpose of this book: it seems that the degree to which a system is willing to acknowledge and legitimize apostolic ministry is directly proportional to the ability to be entrepreneurial and have higher levels of entrepreneurial intensity." This claim will undoubtedly trigger a range of responses from critical to laudatory.</p>
<p>That may well be one of the primary merits of the bold proposal of this missional ecclesiology: it will generate questions that need to be debated passionately and thoroughly. And it should. The lasting value of this theological proposal will be measured by the quality of the debate that it evokes. It speaks to a number of issues that have dogged the missional church process since it started—for example:</p>
<p>The character and role of leadership in the missional church</p>
<p>How Jesus’s own formation of the disciples (described in the four gospels) and the apostles’ formation of their churches (continued in the epistles) define our formation today</p>
<p>The dialectical tension between the church’s dependence on the empowering work of the Holy Spirit and the intentional actions of Christians in obedience to the biblical mandate</p>
<p>The appropriate reception of the Christendom legacy with both critique and gratitude</p>
<p>The faithful translation of the gospel and the formation of witnessing communities in diverse cultures, without being assimilated into those cultures and becoming ultimately their captives</p>
<p>It is significant that the theological process represented by this book (and its predecessors) is shaped by the hard challenges of secularized post-Christian cultures such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is just as significant that some of the most intriguing examples of post-Christendom Western indigenous churches have emerged in the midst of the most advanced, even hostile, secularization. Health-giving theology should emerge from the crucible of such faithful, radically obedient mission. The Permanent Revolution is an example of the kind of theological work that is urgently needed to "equip the saints for the work of ministry" (Ephesians 4:12) apostolically, prophetically, evangelistically, pastorally, and instructively.</p>
