<h2>Lessons from the Frontier: American Westward Expansion</h2>
<p>During the earliest days of European settlement in North America, the vast frontier invited adventure.</p>
<p>The dichotomy between settlers and pioneers shaped national character—pioneers like Lewis and Clark, through tenacious and visionary effort, opened new frontiers for future generations.</p>
<p>Historian Frederick Jackson Turner argued that the frontier—real or conceptual—fundamentally shaped American identity.</p>
<p>Its closing, he warned, potentially signaled the loss of the driving force propelling society forward.</p>
<h2>The Pioneering Spirit in Christian Leadership</h2>
<p>Christianity itself is a faith founded by pioneers—Jesus, the “pioneer and perfecter” of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), and Paul, whose journeys modeled groundbreaking apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>Apostolic pioneers across history—from St.</p>
<p>Patrick to William Booth—embodied courage, resolve, and innovation.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Pioneers</h3>
<p>Pioneers may mobilize the community to explore new edges or move from the organizational center to the edge themselves, facing unique challenges:</p>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>Ability to Invent the Future While Dealing with the Past</p>
<p>Pioneers live in “in-between times” (the end of Christendom, for instance), recognizing that old maps seldom suffice for new territories.</p>
<p>They must chart new paradigms.</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>Willingness to Break with Traditional Ideas and Methods</p>
<p>Frontiers demand innovation; tradition may be helpful in the center, but new contexts demand new forms.</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>Ability to Play Multiple Roles</p>
<p>Pioneers must be chefs and hunters, navigators and map-makers—“leaderplex,” as Robert Hoojberg calls it.</p>
<p>Paul serves as an excellent model: planter, architect, ambassador, and cultural adapter.</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>High Tolerance for Risk</p>
<p>Pioneering ministry involves sacrifice and the inevitability of failure—"fail early, fail often" (Thom Kelley).</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>Need to Be Different Despite Pressure for Sameness</p>
<p>Supporters often pressure pioneers to conform to traditional measures of success.</p>
<p>Enduring this requires hardiness and ambiguity tolerance.</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>Understanding That Many Want the Pioneer to Fail</p>
<p>Innovative pioneers challenge old assumptions, often meeting resistance or even hostility.</p>
<p>Apostolic leaders must break away from certainty and institutional security to create new categories of ministry.</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>Embracing Isolation</p>
<p>Machiavelli wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing is more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than achieving a new order of things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prophets and apostles are often persecuted and must stand alone for the sake of reform.</p>
<h2>Apostolic Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Since entrepreneurship is core to apostolic ministry, organizations must create space for innovation alongside proven methods.</p>
<p>Both exploitation (leveraging what works) and exploration (seeking new possibilities) are necessary.</p>
<h3>Seven Elements of Entrepreneurial People</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Internal Freedom to Explore:</strong> The ability to try new options while anchored to gospel core. 2. <strong>Sense of Holy Dissatisfaction:</strong> The drive to find better ways to advance God’s mission. 3. <strong>Capacity for Ideation:</strong> Combining new concepts and disciplines in creative theological ways. 4. <strong>Ability to Take On Risk:</strong> Implementing new ideas, even at personal cost; action is as important as theory. 5. <strong>Permission and Space to Experiment:</strong> Leadership must create a culture of experimentation and learning from failure. 6. <strong>Dogged Determination:</strong> The resolve to pursue new ideas in the face of resistance and failures (as with Edison’s light bulb, or Paul’s apostolic perseverance). 7. <strong>Innovative Implementation:</strong> Ideation must be coupled with action—dreams alone do not change the world.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Typology of Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Based on Morris's model, four types of organizational entrepreneurship can be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nominal:</strong> Low frequency, low innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Little sustained entrepreneurial effort.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sporadic:</strong> Occasional bursts of innovation without cohesive vision.</li>
<li><strong>Franchised:</strong> Repetition and codification of a single, successful model.</li>
</ul>
<p>High efficiency, low innovation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Sustained, disruptive, and adaptive innovation that keeps the organization in permanent renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic entrepreneurship is rare in churches but essential for dealing with disruptive change.</p>
<p>The Chinese Church under Communism exemplifies this intensity.</p>
<h2>Balancing Mastery and Originality</h2>
<p>James March distinguishes between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Risk, experimentation, innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Refinement, production, implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are vital; systems must oscillate between mastery and originality to survive and thrive—a "dynamic disequilibrium" that propels adaptation and growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When you fall in love with the system you lose the ability to grow."</p>
<p>—Seth Godin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change requires effort and comfort with discomfort—initially, new approaches will seem inferior to old ones.</p>
<p>However, innovation is essential for the Church’s ongoing relevance and vitality.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Apostolicity in the Church</h2>
<p>Mainline and evangelical churches frequently operate on nominal or franchised models.</p>
<p>Innovation initiatives (such as the UK's Fresh Expressions) often remain marginal unless truly embraced by the broader system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We either innovate or continue to experience decline."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The future of apostolic ministry depends on legitimizing innovation—not only at the margins but at the Church’s heart.</p>
<p>The appropriate balance of exploration and exploitation will foster systems that are both adaptive and sustainable, ensuring the Church's ongoing movement and renewal. risk taking, and implementation have to operate together if entrepreneurial ventures are to take place.</p>
<p>This explains why genuine entrepreneurialism is so rare in Christian circles.</p>
<p>We suggest that churches or other organizations that want to become more missional need to be intentional in determining policy and deliberate in making budgetary commitments in a missional direction.</p>
<p>Some may write this all off as idealistic.</p>
<p>And while we certainly have an apostolic vision for the church, we are also completely convinced about the capacity of the apostolic vocation, given to the church by our Lord himself, to both catalyze and maintain movements.</p>
<p>This is not just wishful thinking: it is historical and theological thinking.</p>
<p>As we have seen, both scriptures and church history clearly link the presence and function of the apostolic in exponential movements and in church growth and health.</p>
<p>Some will question whether it is truly possible to experience a permanent revolution.</p>
<p>The routinization of charisma, the process of institutionalization, reification, and a host of other factors all conspire to work against such durability.</p>
<p>Entropy and dissipation are part of the physical and social fabric of reality, yet the very nature of the church’s mission calls for continuous movement; it requires the ever-expanding saturation of cultural and geographical spheres with the gospel until the task is done or our Master returns.</p>
<p>We suggest that the concept of perpetual advance and renewal is directly linked to the presence and activity of the apostolic ministry; they are the permanent revolutionaries who maintain the permanent revolution.</p>
<p>As long as Wesley was alive and active, the movement continued to grow.</p>
<p>The same is true for people as diverse as Aimee Semple McPherson and John Wimber.</p>
<p>The loss of the apostolic influence opens the door to encroaching decline. the enterprise of movement 177 It is not that the apostolic ministry is all that is needed.</p>
<p>We have already noted its interdependent relationship with the other four giftings in the APEST ministry matrix.</p>
<p>But each of these giftings is designed to make a unique contribution to the church being fit for its missional task.</p>
<p>The apostolic gifting is specifically given to the church to generate and sustain missional movement.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial energy, although not exclusively associated with Pauline forms of apostleship, is nonetheless the mark of it.</p>
<p>Paul embodies both the pioneer and the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>He was also a top-rate innovator who was able to translate the gospel and plant it in new cultural contexts without imposing Jewish cultural forms—no mean feat.</p>
<p>Because Pauline work involves breaking new ground when seeding the gospel into new territories, it takes time for seeds to germinate, grow healthily into plants, and begin to produce fruit.</p>
<p>Neil Cole is instructive here.</p>
<p>He dedicates three chapters of his seminal book Organic Church to exploring the slow, unobserved, even subversive nature of seedlike growth.</p>
<p>All plants begin with underground, invisible-to-the-eye, seemingly unfruitful work of seed growing.25 In all these cases, the quality and nature of the initial DNA is of extreme importance.</p>
<p>Skipping the stage of laying foundations of church life and then expecting good results is like tilling and watering the ground without planting the seeds and expecting fruit; all you will get is a field of mud.</p>
<p>Cole also reminds us that if we are deceived into thinking that simply getting people to sit in an auditorium one morning a week for an hour is what it takes to start a church, we have completely missed the significance of many of Jesus’s teachings about seeds and trees and the like.26 Seed sowing involves the patient work of the farmers, somewhat all too aware of their reliance on elements outside their control.</p>
<p>Planting the gospel properly will produce healthy growth, fruit, and ultimately a harvest, but it all depends on whether we work the basics correctly.</p>
<p>And here again we come back to the DNA work, which implants original meaning and purpose of ecclesia.</p>
<p>And although this in a sense belongs to all ministry, it is particularly bound to the function and calling of the apostle as the custodian of the DNA of God’s people.27 The implications of attention to the apostolic work of seed sowing are worked out in Cole’s subsequent book on organic movements, Church 3.0.28 Here he compiles a list that he and colleague Paul Kaak 178 the permanent revolution created of what they call “the ten essential principles of spontaneous multiplication movement”:29 Decentralized without a central control center that must approve all decisions.</p>
<p>Self-contained and self-replicating units of people at every level of development.</p>
<p>Minimally structured; it is dictated by the life of the church, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Not financially crippled and not dependent on outside resources.</p>
<p>All resources for the harvest are found in the harvest.</p>
<p>Driven by ordinary Christians who have been transformed by God and feel an urge to share the good news.</p>
<p>Relationally linked rather than corporately or organizationally bound.</p>
<p>Reproducing at all levels simultaneously (developing from micro to macro).</p>
<p>Driven by a momentum that must be first and always spiritual and then strategic.</p>
<p>Personal transformation precedes community transformation.</p>
<p>Characterized by evangelism that must move from individual conversions to group conversions.</p>
<p>Aware that kingdom life must begin to touch the domains of society and culture, not just individual lives.</p>
<p>We list them here not just because they are a brilliant example of apostolic imagination and practice, but also because they demonstrate that movements are in fact a direct fruit of what is sown in and through the initial seed planted.</p>
<p>In other words, if we must begin with the end in mind, we must also end with the beginning in mind.</p>
<p>If what you want is apostolic movement, you must begin with an apostolic seed—the foundation.</p>
<p>Each seed contains the whole potential for the forest, but it is all contained in the initial seed.</p>
<p>Each element in the system has the full capacity for the whole.30 Founding the church in the way of the archetypal entrepreneur Paul requires keen attention to the nature and quality of gospel seeds and church foundations.</p>
<p>Facing the issues raised in the founding phase raises questions of the relationship between risk and responsibility.</p>
<p>How do we know if our efforts will be productive?</p>
<p>How much time and energy do we invest before we the enterprise of movement 179 decide to move on?</p>
<p>Risk taking is one thing, but being irresponsible and reckless is another story.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial feature of apostolic ministry clearly involves risk taking, but how do we navigate and manage these risks?</p>
<p>The startling fact is that 80 percent of all starts-ups fail.</p>
<p>This alone causes many people to avoid starting anything at all; there is a very high chance of failure and no one wants to fail.</p>
<p>But understanding why failure rates are so high can help us maximize our chances of success.</p>
<p>Most start-ups fail because they lack in one or more of the following aspects: a thorough grasp of the key ideas that inform the project, the right people to lead and operate it, or adequate resources (financial or otherwise) to get them over the initial high-investment phase.</p>
<p>This was some of the hard-earned learning from some of my (Alan) biggest failures—closure of a major missional project called Elevation, which involved a business that experienced some hard times.31 I soon discovered that surviving a start-up requires at least three essential components: The right idea.</p>
<p>Having the right idea basically goes back to the issue of the DNA of the missional enterprise.</p>
<p>Not only is this an issue of theology (who), ecclesiology (what), and the like, it is also a matter of strategy (how).</p>
<p>In business circles, this is the business plan, and it requires a thorough grasp of every aspect of the business: market research, product placement, budgeting, customer relations, and the unique selling proposition (what makes this project different in relation to that of the competition).</p>
<p>For apostolic practitioners, this will involve helping the key stakeholders see and understand the nature of God and the gospel, but it must also move beyond that into helping them conceptualize how the community will go about its core tasks.</p>
<p>The right people.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that having the wrong people in the right places is disastrous for any project—even more so when the stakes are high, as in entrepreneurial start-ups.</p>
<p>Choosing wisely here is critical in high-risk ventures.</p>
<p>This is clearly a principle in the New Testament church.</p>
<p>People of the right calling, character, and commitment are to be placed in leadership of the church (for example, Romans 12:1–8; 1 Timothy; 2 Timothy).</p>
<p>People without these characteristics should never be put in a start-up.</p>
<p>One of the key lessons I learned from the Elevation experience was what I call the stakeholder principle: all members of the core team must have significant skin in the game in order to participate fully in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>People who are not stakeholders should not be allowed to make key decisions because they do not have to live with those decisions.</p>
<p>The greater the degree of 180 the permanent revolution stakeholding, the greater the right to make determinative decisions. A metaphor may help.</p>
<p>Two animals, the chicken and the pig, contribute to a breakfast of bacon and eggs.</p>
<p>One contributes something that can be reproduced and the other gives its life.</p>
<p>Both are stakeholders in the breakfast, but only one gives everything.</p>
<p>The principle here is that in entrepreneurial start-ups, the pigs must rule!32 The right resources.</p>
<p>This one is obvious to some degree.</p>
<p>Although it relates to the issue of funding, it should not just be thought of narrowly as buildings and budgets.</p>
<p>It should include personal resources as well.</p>
<p>At core this means assessing whether you have the wherewithal to go the whole distance, financially and otherwise.</p>
<p>Jesus’s warnings about counting the costs in constructing a tower or going to war, while referring to discipleship in particular, is appropriate advice here as well (Luke 14:28–32).</p>
<p>You do not want to start something you are not willing to finish.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs should plan for the worst-case scenario in relation to uptake.</p>
<p>All entrepreneurial start-ups should try their best to have all three aspects figured out if they want to maximize sustainability beyond the early phases and want to become part of the 20 percent that survive.</p>
<p>While some with two bases covered might survive, it is highly improbable that any enterprise, business or missional, will survive long with just one.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Elevation probably had one and a half (wrong people, half-baked business plan, enough money), and it cost us dearly in both financial and leadership capital as a result.</p>
<p>Before this is dismissed as mere business-speak and inappropriate to the issue of apostolic ministry, it is not hard to find a very similar approach in Paul’s practices.</p>
<p>As the archetypal apostolic entrepreneur in the church, clearly he dedicated much of his life to articulating the DNA of the emerging movement and ensuring it kept on track with the right ideas.</p>
<p>Also, he was clearly very interested in making sure the right people were in the right places.</p>
<p>Remember his refusal to include John Mark in what most people categorize as his second missionary journey (Acts 15:36–40).</p>
<p>In fact, at times he sounds like a line manager issuing orders about who should and should not be leading (see 1 Timothy 3:1–13; 2 Timothy 4:14; Titus 1:6).</p>
<p>Paul also spent significant time on the issue of resourcing.</p>
<p>For instance, he arranged for offerings to be taken up and distributed throughout the budding movement, and he himself was a tent maker.</p>
<p>All three of these aspects of entrepreneurialism can be demonstrated in the ministries of the great missional entrepreneurs like St.</p>
<p>Patrick (and the enterprise of movement 181 the Celts) and John Wesley (and the Methodists) and in more contemporary ones like Mike Breen, the McManus brothers, and Neil Cole.</p>
<p>The American evangelist George Whitfield famously called his revival a “rope of sand” (unsustainable) because it lacked the strategic capacities and long-term impact that the strongly apostolic Wesley seeded into the movement he founded.</p>
<p>These included classes (discipleship), training and equipping laity, church planting, accountability to DNA, and decentralized organization.</p>
<p>Whitfield had little or no idea of how to create movement that went beyond the salvation response.</p>
<p>He did not have a comprehensive plan and did not mentor leaders (did not recruit the right people) even though he probably had significant support (resources).</p>
<p>Apostolic movements clearly have strategy, good theology, method, and the right personnel.</p>
<p>That is partly why they change the world.33 Apostolic leadership is entrepreneurial in nature.</p>
<p>To the degree to which we can value it and embed high-intensity entrepreneurialism into the culture of the organization itself, we create the kind of missional movement that can advance the cause of Jesus in our day.</p>
<p>To value something is to give it the weight of your commitments, live into it, and see whatever project arises from these commitments through.</p>
<p>It is time to get entrepreneurial in the church; in other words, it is time to become apostolic again. ‌The Spirit of Innovation creating new futures for the jesus movement We are better at (involuntary) doing out of the box than (voluntary) thinking out of the box.</p>
<p>The society that abolishes every adventure makes its own abolition the only possible adventure. J.</p>
<p>Jordan When the forms of an old culture are dying, the new culture is created by a few people who are not afraid to be insecure. george bernard shaw once famously said, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world while the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.</p>
<p>Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” Although that may seem foolish, actually Shaw grasped what many social science writers are now only beginning to explore: the supposed lack of apparent rationality in many of the choices we make.1 Not only are we all far less rational in our decision making than has been assumed, but what often is called ridiculous and contrarian can turn out to be the source of much creativity.</p>
<p>Consider the following statements that arose squarely from the predictable thinking of their day: “The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered a means of communication.”—Western Union internal memo, 1876 “The problem with television is that the people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for 184 the permanent revolution it.”—New York Times, after a prototype demonstration at the 1939 World’s Fair “The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a novelty—a fad.”—Advice from a president of the Michigan Savings Bank to Henry Ford’s lawyer, Horace Rackham, who ignored the advice and invested $5,000 in Ford stock, selling it later for $12.5 million Now consider that Albert Einstein failed the most basic measure of conventional rationality: matriculation in college.</p>
<p>Add to this that Apple’s Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame were both college dropouts, not to mention that our Lord was crucified for being a radical maverick.</p>
<p>Clearly an unconventional, contrarian mind is often a characteristic of innovators and category breakers.</p>
<p>While all this hints at the almost perennial issues of pragmatism versus idealism and conventional versus contrarian thinking, it also relates to the ability to take risks, break out of tradition, and face derision.</p>
<p>These so-called unreasonable people are responsible for the vast majority of innovations and entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
<p>History, it seems, does favor the brave fools who are willing to break from conventional wisdom to explore new options.</p>
<p>Apostles are, in the end, our “unreasonable people,” the pioneers and “holy fools” (2 Corinthians 11:16–21) who adapt the world to suit their vision of it as defined in Christ.</p>
<p>They are responsible for the real spiritual progress across the ages.</p>
<p>The Age of the Unthinkable When Plato said that “the problem with the future is that more things might happen than will happen,” he was alluding to the general annoyance we feel when confronted by uncertainty and ambiguity.2 It would be much safer to move into the future knowing exactly how it will look.</p>
<p>But we do not get to experience the future in that way.</p>
<p>In fact, as we know all too well, life itself is not risk free, certain, or predictable.</p>
<p>There will always be a degree of uncertainty and open-endedness to life and the human experience.</p>
<p>Stanley Gryskiewicz, in his book Positive Turbulence, addresses the importance of ambiguity in the creative process: Ambiguity is a state in which many possibilities exist.</p>
<p>To make an analogy, when an artist faces a completely blank canvas, there are literally millions of pictures that could be created.</p>
<p>It has been the spirit of innovation 185 said that the first stroke of the artist’s brush destroys countless numbers of possible paintings, and each successive dab of paint limits the number of paintings that are possible on that canvas even more.3 But as history amply shows, we prefer regularity and predictability and want to forgo the perils of adventure in exchange for a more manageable experience of life, especially in institutions.</p>
<p>Here, at least in part, lies the psychology behind institutionalism: all institutions, religious or otherwise, are designed to provide the safety of predictability achieved through ritual, dogma, and control through regulations, policies, the promise of reward, or the threat of discipline.</p>
<p>That is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is the boon that institutions confer on us: by providing regularity, recognizability, and ritual, they relieve us of having to incessantly develop new ways of doing things.</p>
<p>But when risk averseness becomes obsessive or a core aspect of the ethos of any organization, it is destructive.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for the church.</p>
<p>Christian spirituality requires that we find ourselves by giving ourselves away, that we risk loving until it hurts us, and that we engage in the risky enterprise of mission.</p>
<p>We are to be the kind of people whom Jesus himself modeled.4 Oddly, mission, the very thing that births the church in the first place and remains its abiding call, sets the preconditions for perpetual movement.</p>
<p>Mission implies that we have a preferred future, a definite and desired outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, being based on God’s particular, and as yet a partly fulfilled vision for the world, its adherents cannot accept the status quo.</p>
<p>Mission is dicey because of the real possibility that things will not go as planned.</p>
<p>And it is precisely this uncertainty, the contingency of it all, that makes investing in a mission risky business.</p>
<p>Yet there can be no avoiding it: God’s people are called to be a missional movement.</p>
<p>This means we must act even when it seems to violate our penchant for safety and security—and perhaps especially then.</p>
