<p>In Missional Communities, Reggie serves as that guide who introduces you to the people, practices and scorecard of this fresh growth plate of the kingdom.” —Eric Swanson, coauthor, The Externally Focused Quest and To Transform a City “Once again, Reggie McNeal has been reading my mind!</p>
<p>He has given voice to those of us who dream of a church that is not just a conspiracy of strangers but a redemptive community on mission for God.</p>
<p>For those who dare to make the journey this book provides some invaluable navigational charts for how to get there.” —Gary Brandenburg, lead pastor, Fellowship Bible Church Dallas, Dallas, TX From Reggie McNeal, the bestselling author of The Present Future and Missional Renaissance, comes the third book in the series that helps to define and illuminate the popular missional movement.</p>
<p>This newest book in the trilogy examines a natural outgrowth of the move toward a missional orientation: the deconstruction of congregations into very small Christian communities.</p>
<p>For all those thousands of churches and leaders who have followed Reggie McNeal’s bold lead, this book details the rise of a new life form in churches and the promise that they hold for greater vitality and meaning in every aspect of their ministry, their members’ lives, and their impact in their communities. REGGIE MCNEAL (Columbia, South Carolina) is the missional leadership specialist for Leadership Network.</p>
<p>Drawing on twenty years of leadership roles in local congregations and his work over the last two decades with thousands of clergy and church leaders, McNeal counsels local churches, denominational groups, seminaries and colleges, and parachurch organizations in their leadership development needs.</p>
<p>Changing the Scorecard for the Church Reggie McNeal ISBN: 978-0-470-24344-2 “Any new book by Reggie McNeal is something of an event, and this book is no exception.</p>
<p>Not only is this an excellent introduction to missional Christianity, but it establishes a much-needed metric by which we can assess the vitality of this highly significant new movement.” —Alan Hirsch, author, The Permanent Revolution, The Forgotten Ways, Rejesus, and The Shaping of Things to Come; founding director, Forge Mission Training System; co-founder, shapevine.com Missional Renaissance is McNeal’s much-anticipated follow-up to his groundbreaking, best-selling book, The Present Future, which quickly became one of the definitive works on the “missional church movement.” In Missional Renaissance, Reggie McNeal shows the three significant shifts in the church leaders’ thinking and behavior that will allow their congregations to chart a course toward becoming truly a missional congregation.</p>
<p>To embrace the missional model, church leaders and members must shift from an internal to an external focus, ending the church as exclusive social club model; from running programs and ministries to developing people as its core activity; and from church-based leadership to community-engaged leadership.</p>
<p>The book is filled with in-depth discussions of what it means to become a missional congregation and important information on how to make the transition.</p>
<p>Missional Renaissance offers a clear path for any leader or congregation that wants to breathe new life into the church and to become revitalized as true followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>Church 3.0 Upgrades for the Future of the Church ISBN 978-0-470-52945-4 Cloth image 304 pp. “Church 3.0 is an all-in-one compass, survival manual, tool kit, leadership agenda, and imagineering workshop.</p>
<p>It is a treasure trove that distributes the wealth of Neil Cole’s rich experience and insight. I cannot imagine trying to navigate without it.” —Reggie McNeal, author, Missional Renaissance In Church 3.0, Cole makes the argument that Christianity needs more than new programs, buildings, or worship formats.</p>
<p>It needs a complete upgrade to a new operating system.</p>
<p>The early church shifted to a more institutional form in 300 ad and has been stuck in the 2.0 operating system ever since.</p>
<p>We are overdue for the next upgrade.</p>
<p>Church 3.0 discusses issues such as how to deal with heresy, how to handle finances, what to do with children, and what to do with worship, rituals, and ordinances.</p>
<p>Even the most enthusiastic proponents and practitioners of organic churches often wonder how to handle such matters in a faithful way. NEIL COLE is an experienced and innovative church planter and pastor.</p>
<p>He is the founder of the Awakening Chapels, which are reaching young postmodern people in urban settings, and a founder and executive director of Church Multiplication Associates.</p>
<p>He is the author of Organic Church as well as Search and Rescue, Organic Leadership, and Cultivating a Life for God.</p>
<p>Hugh Halter and Matt Smay ISBN: 978-0-470-58023-3 “Among increasing numbers of faithful, conservative, Bible-believing Christians, an important shift is beginning to occur.</p>
<p>These aren’t wildeyed radicals; they’re solid, established church leaders and members who are asking new questions because deep within they discern that something is wrong with the status quo.</p>
<p>Hugh and Matt have been through this shift, and offer wise counsel for a way forward.” —Brian McLaren, author, A New Kind of Christian Trilogy and Everything Must Change Written for those who are trying to nurture authentic faith communities and for those who have struggled to retain their faith, The Tangible Kingdom offers theological answers and real-life stories that demonstrate how the best ancient church practices can re-emerge in today’s culture, through any church of any size.</p>
<p>The Tangible Kingdom outlines an innovative model for creating thriving grass-roots faith communities, offering new hope for church leaders, pastors, church planters, and churchgoers who are looking for practical new ways to re-orient their lives to fit God’s mission today. HUGH HALTER is a specialist with Church Resource Ministries and the national director of Missio, a global network of missional leaders and church planters.</p>
<p>He is also lead architect of Adullam, a congregational network of incarnational communities in Denver, Colorado (www.adullamdenver.com). MATT SMAY co-directs both Missio and Adullam and specializes in helping existing congregations move toward mission.</p>

<p>Missional Map-Making Skills for Leading in Times of Transition “This important book provides insightful historical perspective toward clarifying the contours of our present landscape, while also being deeply instructive for helping reflective and courageous Christians develop skills for creating new maps toward participating more faithfully in God’s mission.” —Craig Van Gelder, Ph.D., Professor of Congregational Mission, Luther Seminary In the burgeoning missional church movement, churches are seeking to become less focused on programs for members and more oriented toward outreach to people who are not already in church.</p>
<p>This fundamental shift in what a congregation is and does and thinks is challenging for leaders and congregants.</p>
<p>Using the metaphor of map-making, this book explains the perspective and skills needed to lead congregations and denominations in a time of radical change over unfamiliar terrain as churches change their focus from internal to external. ALAN ROXBURGH is president of Missional Leadership Institute (Mli) and has pastored congregations in small towns, urban centers and the suburbs.</p>
