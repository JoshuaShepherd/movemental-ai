<h1>Preface: A Briefing for the Journey</h1>
<p>Thousands of years ago, and well before mass publishing, Ecclesiastes wryly commented that of the making of books, there is no end (Ecclesiastes 12:12). We cannot imagine what he'd say today. So what are we doing writing one more book?</p>
<h3>Why We Wrote This Book</h3>
<p>Given the fact that so little of substance has been written on the subject of Ephesians 4 (which speaks of the roles of apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers—APEST) in general, and the apostolic ministry and person in particular, the sin in this case actually lies in the deficiency of thinking and reflection in these matters, not in their excess. This is a big statement, but we hope to show that it is entirely justifiable. Here are some of our guiding objectives and reasons.</p>
<h4>To Change Some Minds and Strengthen Others</h4>
<p>First, in relation to those unaware, the not yet convinced, or even those who harbor antipathy to the idea of the fivefold ministry in general and the apostolic in particular, our aim is nothing less than to change minds about the importance of these for the church today.</p>
<p>We cannot shake the conviction that nothing less than the future viability of the Western church is involved in the revitalization of its ministry along more biblical lines.</p>
<p>And so if we fail to somehow shift any readers’ paradigm, even a little, then we consider that we will have failed at least in part.</p>
<p>This is no small task: we fully recognize that we are going against the inherited grain of thinking in this matter.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we think that the Western church has been wrong on this, and it is high time for a thorough reassessment, along with some significant change, in this regard.</p>
<p>Second, for those who are already convinced of the need for a broader, apostolically focused ministry in the church—either because they come from traditions where the typology of Ephesians 4 is accepted or have become more aware of the power of APEST because of their immersion in missional thinking and practice—we hope to strengthen your case, calibrate your thinking and practice, correct possible misperceptions, and equip you with a deeper and significantly sturdier justification of these particular aspects of the biblical ministry than has been given to date.</p>
<p>Our hope is that this work will encourage and equip others in their ministry and help them better fulfill their calling as part of God’s people in his kingdom.</p>
<h4>To Rectify the Poverty of Thinking in Relation to Ephesians 4 and Apostolic Ministry</h4>
<p>From our research, it appears that most standard thinking actually delegitimizes the apostolic role by either replacing it with the canon of scripture (as in Protestantism) or by transferring apostolicity to the bishops and the institution of the church itself (as in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy).</p>
<p>There seems to be no space between biblicism and institutionalism for any contemporary activation of the apostolic role.</p>
<p>This seems utterly strange to us given the central role that apostolic ministry plays in the New Testament itself, as well as in every movement that has achieved significant missionary impact throughout history.</p>
<p>And although there are some good academic studies exploring the role of the original apostles in the New Testament church and in the first three centuries, most of these are scholarly and inaccessible to the average reader and have little to say to the concerns of contemporary apostolic mission and ministry.1 In fact, when they do comment on the possibility of ongoing ministry, they tend to take the standard line that apostles (as well as prophets and, to a lesser degree, evangelists) have not featured in the church’s ministry mix since Constantine.</p>
<p>As we shall see, this is not so.</p>
<p>The other school of thought and reflection on Ephesians 4 and the apostolic ministry tends to have a distinctly charismatic, pragmatist, and fundamentalist perspective.</p>
<p>It also is loaded with the type of dominion theology that effectively equates the apostolic with a kind of superpastor— the hotshot CEO type in the organization.</p>
<p>And while most quote the Bible a fair bit, they tend to lack any theological depth and end up being one-dimensional in approach and perspective.</p>
<p>In many ways, these approaches provide the easy straw man that academics and clergy find all too easy to reject.</p>
<p>At best, these writings are highly unlikely to convince the unconvinced, and at worst, they hinder the cause in the broader church.</p>
<p>Neither of these approaches—the scholarly New Testament studies theorists and the one-dimensional charismaniacs—is much help as we seek to rediscover our missional calling and purpose.</p>
<p>And as far as we are aware, there is at this time no single, comprehensive reference text available promoting the ongoing role of the apostolic person in the ongoing life of the church.</p>
<p>Consider this book at least the beginnings of a muchneeded remedy.</p>
<h4>To Change the Frameworks</h4>
<p>As you will soon discover, The Permanent Revolution is mainly a work of theological (re)imagination and (re)construction.</p>
<p>We have drawn deeply from biblical studies, theology, organizational theory, leadership studies, and the key social sciences to substantiate our claims about Ephesians 4 and the ongoing legitimacy of the apostolic role.</p>
<p>All of this points to our fundamental claim: that insofar that it depends on human agency, the church’s capacity to embody and extend the mission and purposes of Jesus in the world depends largely on a full-intention to provide robust theoretical foundations with which to relegitimize and restructure the ministry of the church as fivefold and to reembrace the revitalizing, intrinsically missional role of the apostolic person.</p>
<p>We are in fact attempting to rescript the very codes that shape our view of ministry—nothing less than a shift in our thinking.</p>
<p>We have intentionally sought to construct a substantive text, not only because there is precious little positive material on the subject, but also because the holism of Ephesians 4:11 has effectively been discarded, marginalized, or deliberately ejected almost entirely from our thinking and practice.</p>
<p>Reframing paradigms is difficult work.</p>
<p>It goes against the grain of acquired thinking and exposes many blind spots, and it is likely to meet with resistance from those deeply invested in the prevailing paradigm.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we feel constrained to submit this for reflection in the hope the Spirit will awaken ancient energies largely dormant within the Western church.</p>
<p>To make the truth of The Permanent Revolution unavoidable, we have deliberately used an interdisciplinary recipe of theology, sociology, leadership studies, psychology, and the organizational sciences because we believe that they all point us in the direction originally given in the New Testament itself.</p>
<p>All truth is God’s truth, and we believe that nowhere else is this more evident than in this area of New Testament ecclesiology.</p>
<p>The church, rightly conceived as an organic movement, was well ahead of its time in relation to best thinking and best practices on organizations and leadership.</p>
<p>Everything in contemporary literature and research on these issues confirms the ingenious design built into the ecclesia that Jesus intended.</p>
<p>Our primary audience for this book remains the key leaders in the churches and other organizations that make up the heartland of biblical Christianity—from Conservative evangelical to Pentecostal, from missional to traditional, and anything in between.</p>
<p>We are both evangelicals in the broad nonsectarian sense of the word.2 Alan has roots within the Pentecostal tradition, has a Reformed theological training, and has worked with all the major evangelical churches for most of his time in ministry.</p>
<p>Tim is a grassroots church planter with a restorationist heritage and training.</p>
<p>We both love, and are deeply committed to, the church, but some readers are going to be tempted to think of us as fervent anti-institutionalists.</p>
<p>And although we offer a critique of institutionalism, we are not against structure and organization in any way.</p>
<p>In fact, the reader will find a plethora of material that relates to organization and systems thinking laced throughout the book.</p>
<p>And certainly we see ourselves as servants of God’s people in all the forms in which they express themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although we accept the role of tradition in guiding and sustaining the church in any age, we will admit that in our view, institutionalism and traditionalism almost invariably involve reliance on past formulas and thinking, tend to be reactionary, snuff out creative thinking and solutions, and are self-referential and bureaucratic.</p>
<p>We ask questions in this book that go to the leadership paradigm, and when doing this, it is impossible to avoid the twin issues of traditionalism and institutionalism—both well represented in the Bible.</p>
<p>From a prophetic concern with the corrupt and corruptible institutions of the king, judge, and priesthood; to Jesus’s railing against the oppressive religious institutionalism of the scribes and pharisees of his day; to Paul’s doctrine of the powers entrenched in human institutions and people: the Bible sustains a thorough and consistent critique of religious institutionalism.</p>
<p>Without wanting to sound self-righteous, we really do feel that we are in good company here.</p>
<p>As uncomfortable as critical appraisals tend to make us feel, we do well to remind ourselves at this point that despite the towering effect that institutions have on us, they have to be seen for what they truly are: mere products of human activity.</p>
<p>As human constructs, institutions cannot adequately reflect back to us our own intrinsic worth.</p>
<p>Jesus’s own rejection by the religious and political establishment of his day bears witness to the tendency of institutions to develop their own metrics and categories for what should and should not be valued or deemed essential.</p>
<p>It is in Jesus himself that we can find the higher authority—one that transcends the towering effect of the institutions—with which to speak the corrective word into our context.</p>
<h4>To Stimulate Apostolic Imagination, Leading to Missional Action</h4>
<p>Because not much has been written on the subject of apostolic ministry and because it has not been a historic model, we did not have a lot of constructive material to work with.</p>
<p>That is why in some parts of this book, we have had to exercise a fair bit of theological imagination mingled with ideas gleaned from the social sciences.</p>
<p>We hope readers find our thinking stimulating, but we ask them to remember that at some points, we are engaging in educated guesswork and theological intuition and to give us some space to be playful.</p>
<p>Engage these sections with an open mind, and do not assume we are being prescriptive.</p>
<p>Rather, we are offering spiritual prods, or suggestive thought-experiments, aimed to stimulate thinking and action.</p>
<p>Rest assured that we never make wild conjectures.</p>
<p>Even our guesses are informed and weighted with a lot of reflection.</p>
<p>And we will let you know when we are making intuitive leaps.</p>
<p>The book is intentionally loaded with challenging concepts and replete with fertile ideas that carry rich possibilities for new learning and action.</p>
<p>We did not intend to produce a praxis-oriented work; we hope to leave that to a possible future workbook based on this book.</p>
<p>Our aim is to empower the church as movement and not to simply add another book to a seminary curriculum and library.</p>
<p>We hope it will help leaders become the leaders God intended them to be in the first place.</p>
<p>Like any other good revolution, the aim is to liberate your minds as well as your vocations from the constraints currently imposed on them.3</p>
<h3>Who Wrote What?</h3>
<p>This book is a collaboration between the two of us.</p>
<p>In addition, 3DM leader Mike Breen assisted in the construction of Part One, on Ephesians and APEST, contributing some key ideas and doing some editing and commenting.</p>
<p>Mike is a long-term practitioner of Ephesians 4 ministry.</p>
<p>He is a highly respected international leader, a genuinely seminal thinker and practitioner, and one of the most prolific Christian leaders to emerge from Great Britain in a decade or more.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for Mike himself and what he represents to the missional movement of our day.</p>
<p>He is a genuine permanent revolutionary, and we are honored that he is willing to put his name on this material.</p>
<p>Most of the book is a work of our own collaboration.</p>
<p>Tim has played the role of primary researcher and resident maven.</p>
<p>He did his job all too well, because in order to get the book to a reasonable size and focus, we had to delete about half of what he researched and wrote.</p>
<p>Alan’s primary role has been to shape the material and direct the project and, of course, add his own writing along the way—his aim being to elaborate on previously written material as well as add new insights on the topic.</p>
<p>We write in the first person wherever it is appropriate and where personal biography is involved.</p>
<p>But for the most part, we use the second person we and speak in common voice.</p>
<p>On issues of examples, we have certainly provided them where we could, but we have generally chosen to bolster the ideas with numerous figures.</p>
<p>What we lack in stories we certainly make up for in illustrations.</p>
<p>Partly this is a personality thing because we are conceptual thinkers and tend to think more in pictures and less in narrative, and partly it is because we believe that diagrams better convey the ideas we hope to communicate.</p>
<p>A Word to the Wise It was the ancient philosopher Epictetus who stated that it is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.</p>
<p>And that could be true for all of us who think that we know what church and ministry is.</p>
<p>Most of us have been raised in, trained in, and thoroughly coded by the prevailing paradigm.4 Therefore, initial responses to this material that come readily to mind generally arise directly out of the deep scripting we have assumed to be true.</p>
<p>This is the very scripting that has led us inexorably to the decline of the church in the West.</p>
<p>Because of this, we ask that you allow yourself to reimagine ministry as we are presenting it, even if it does not square with the prevailing scripts and invites repentance and change.</p>
<p>We suggest that you try to restrain any somewhat reflexive defenses for a while, so that you might look afresh at a core issue of ecclesiology.</p>
<p>If we are right about this, changing the primary scripts will completely revolutionize the way we conceive of being and doing church in a very good way.</p>
<p>To be able to learn anything new, we have to be willing to think differently about ourselves and approach ideas from a different angle, which will allow new possibilities to arise.</p>
<p>Remember that Albert Einstein, the great paradigm buster, wisely said, “The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education." Please do not let your education interfere with your learning on this matter.</p>
<p>Way too much is at stake.</p>
<p>This is an unusually large book because it explores a big and strategically critical issue.</p>
<p>We fully realize that for various reasons, including issues of time and patience, weighty books might put off some readers.</p>
<p>But we suggest that the importance of the subject and the critical situation of the church at this time require that we delve deep and do not shortchange the intellectual and spiritual engagement required to change the game now.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read this book carefully and, if you can, do this with others and discuss it as you go.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced of the need for apostolic ministry in the church and are pressed for time, you can skip Chapter Six and the Appendix at the back of the book.</p>
<p>That will reduce the text by about 15 percent.</p>
<p>A View from the Top The only thing left to do in this Preface is to describe the logic and the flow of the book itself.</p>
<p>Part One, on Ephesians 4:1–16, provides the basis for a fuller understanding of biblical ministry, as well the context for an exploration of the apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>This is where Mike Breen collaborates with us.</p>
<p>Part Two is about apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>Chapter Five is a key chapter: it provides the basic definitions of apostolicity that we use throughout the book.</p>
<p>Chapter Six suggests some largely unexplored, and we hope fruitful, ways in which to understand the nuances within the apostolic ministry itself.</p>
<p>We contrast Pauline and Petrine apostolic ministry and their contributions to creating missional impact.</p>
<p>And because of these distinctions, Chapter Seven looks beyond the purely pioneering function normally associated with the apostolic role to see how the apostolic ministry facilitates ongoing renewal in the life of the church.</p>
<p>Part Three focuses on apostolic leadership.</p>
<p>Rather than ranging far and wide, we focus on leadership in relation to missional innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the pioneering functions, along with those of custodian, designer, and architect, we look at how apostolic leadership can provide new and missionally creative ways forward.</p>
<p>Part Four focuses on apostolic organization.</p>
<p>Clearly, issues of how we structure and organize are critical to being translocal and movemental.</p>
<p>Being ignorant about the issue of social structures generally hands dynamic movements over to the human default of increasing institutionalism.</p>
<p>This final part of the book examines the nature of organization as reframed through the lens of apostolic ministry and leadership, particularly that of being a movement.</p>
<p>And then we look at essential characteristics of apostolic movements and how to restructure in a way that more consistently aligns with them.</p>
<p>The Appendix is in effect an essay that we feel is important enough to include in the book but not necessary to the flow of the book itself.</p>
<p>We felt that the issues of how and why the apostles, prophets, and evangelists (the APE functions in APEST) were exiled warrant further understanding.</p>
<p>They bring needed insights and provide clues to our own thinking in these matters.</p>
<p>We ask that you be patient with us as we seek to (re)construct a holistic understanding of an all-but-lost imagination.</p>
<p>We address some of the more practical questions about organization in Part Four.</p>
<p>And given that we do not have a rich heritage of thinking and acting on which to draw from, we beg readers’ indulgence in using examples that are clear-cut illustrations of apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>We love Patrick, John Wesley, William Booth, Aimee Semple McPherson, and others: they provide lights that we can all walk by, and so they become our primary models.</p>
<p>This is not to say there are not countless others who express apostolic forms, only that they might lack the profile needed to substantiate this kind of work.</p>
<p>By emphasizing human agency and our responsibility to make the leadership decisions to shift the paradigm, it is not our intention to diminish the sovereignty of God in all affairs and that we live in and through his grace.</p>
<p>The survival of the church is surely a testimony to the grace of God who has not forsaken us as much as we have forsaken him.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to say that we submit this book to our readers in humble trust that the Holy Spirit will use it for the furtherance of the cause of our Lord</p>
<p>Jesus in this broken world.</p>
<p>To God be the glory, and Viva la revolución permanente!</p>
<p>‌Introduction the crisis of infertility and what to do about it</p>
<p>The illiterate of the future are not those that cannot read or write.</p>
<p>They are those that cannot learn, unlearn, relearn.</p>
<p>People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete— the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are.</p>
<p>He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress.</p>
<p>Anwar el-Sadat in the movie the children of men, there is a plague of infertility, and no one knows why.</p>
<p>Diego Ricardo is the youngest person in the world: eighteen years, four months, twenty days, sixteen hours, and eight minutes old.</p>
<p>He was the last human being to be born on earth, and since his birth, women everywhere have been unable to reproduce.</p>
<p>When he suddenly dies, his demise is repeatedly broadcast and is viewed as a not-sosubtle reminder of the slowly creeping disaster that has undermined hope and created political disorder, social decay, radical doubt, and universal despair.</p>
<p>The aging population is edging toward the end of the human race.</p>
<p>In the story, Great Britain is one of the only places in the world that has managed to maintain a limited sense of order, and people from everywhere have fled there, only to be rounded up as illegal refugees and transported to holding bins where they await deportation to the anarchy of Europe.</p>
<p>Amid this chaos, Theo, a British citizen grown cynical and despairing in the surrounding hopelessness, is paid by a band of revolutionaries to escort Kee, a young woman, out of Britain and hand her over to an underground organization called the Human Project.</p>
<p>Theo soon discovers that his mission is much riskier than he had expected, and he faces, and courageously evades, all kinds of traps to guard her from danger.</p>
<p>But Theo is not told why his charge is so controversial.</p>
<p>Clearly she has become the focus of militant groups, and his association with her has made him a prime target for violent attacks.</p>
<p>It is not until he gets halfway to their destination that he finds out exactly who this woman is and why she is so important: Kee is pregnant, and the revolutionaries want to use her as a tool, a symbol of hope, a powerful weapon in a high-stakes political game to incite a revolution that would overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Whatever sense of responsibility Theo felt toward his assignment in the beginning is now amplified as he realizes that the very future of humanity is in his custody.</p>
<p>This is no ordinary assignment.</p>
<p>He is to cross dangerous terrain, through uncharted territories, so that Kee can regenerate the human race.</p>
<p>Theo is a custodian of life in a world of infertility.</p>
<p>The Children of Men provides a parabolic pointer to a similar fruitlessness in the church throughout the West.</p>
<p>To explain it, some have said that the vinedresser is simply pruning his vine or that he is judging some supposed unfaithfulness on our part, and that it will pass and our fertility will return.</p>
<p>However we may want to figure it, we have to acknowledge that after almost twenty centuries of Christianity in Western contexts, we have generally not seen the kind of transformation implied in the gospel.</p>
<p>Neither have we often approximated the vibrancy of the gospel movements that somehow manage to structure their ecclesial life much closer to the kind of church that Jesus designed it to be in the first place: that of an apostolic people movement; the kind of dynamic, fluid, viral, ecclesiology we see in the pages of the New Testament and throughout history.</p>
<p>The early church, various movements over the centuries, and the developing world now (especially India and China) have displayed this same vitality.</p>
<p>These are all great expressions of apostolic movement.</p>
<p>Our situation today is not that dissimilar to the one described in The Children of Men.</p>
<p>All of the statistical indicators show serious infertility in Western Christianity, and so we too are caught in a despairing spiral of trended numerical and spiritual decline in just about every context in the Western world.1</p>
<p>A Permanent Revolution?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>In this situation, we are forced to ask ourselves what the church is all about.</p>
<p>What are God’s original purposes in and through his people?</p>
<p>Is the gospel capable of renewing the world and transforming the hearts of all human beings?</p>
<p>Did God really mean for the ecclesia to be the focal introduction point for the wholesale renewal of society?</p>
<p>Are we really called to be a colony of a much-disputed kingdom, or did Jesus intend that we become the chaplains of a so-called Christian civilization in the West?</p>
<p>These are questions that take us to the core of our self-understanding and purpose, and we must be willing to ask them again and again.</p>
<p>It was seminal missiologist Ralph Winter who said, “Every major decision you make will be faulty until you see the whole world as God sees it.”2 Seeing things from God’s perspective is what lies at the heart of what it means to have a biblical perspective, and certainly it matters when it comes to thinking about the church, its mission, its leadership, and its intended impact.</p>
<p>The two of us fully believe that the ecclesia that Jesus intended was specifically designed with built-in, self-generative capacities and was made for nothing less than world-transforming, lasting, and, yes, revolutionary impact (see, for example, Matthew 16:18).</p>
<p>And we certainly do not believe that Christianity was ever meant to become a domesticated civil religion.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, Jesus intended us to be a permanent revolution—an outpost of the kingdom of God no less.</p>
<p>And if we are not actually being that, then we have to take stock.</p>
<p>When the embarrassing issue of falling short of being somewhat infertile is brought out into the open, it raises all kind of questions about the nature and function of church, the influence of various types of leadership, and ultimately the intended impact of the gospel.</p>
<p>And while clearly unprecedented global economic, social, and cultural shifts are taking place in our time, we believe that the current decline of Christianity cannot be blamed on these external factors alone.</p>
<p>That is just a dodge, and a dangerous and irresponsible one at that.</p>
