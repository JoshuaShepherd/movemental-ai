<h1>Come Back Peter, Come Back Paul</h1>
<p>The most common way people deal with risk and uncertainty is by analyzing past events and circumstances to discover consistent patterns and predictable outcomes.</p>
<p>We believe we can significantly minimize risk by embracing strategies and models that have already been tried and tested.</p>
<p>Roger Martin calls these proven models or strategies algorithms—a predefined formula that, when applied, produces reliable outcomes.5 Yet when algorithms are applied to new situations that require a new approach, they can prove disastrous. When strategy and environment become radically incongruent, as they are in our day, we need to explore innovative strategies in order to effectively reengage that environment.</p>
<p>This is true for existing churches that are trying to engage their own contexts, but it also has a wider, more systemic application for Christianity as a whole.</p>
<p>As we alluded to in Chapter Four, in order for any system to survive, the complexity within it has to be equal to or greater than the complexity of its environment.</p>
<p>Putting aside all the other factors at play in our increasingly globalized world, the cultural landscape in the West has become increasingly complex and diverse, which has created a black swan event for the church.</p>
<p>We need to move beyond our overreliance on the church growth algorithm and explore different approaches to missional engagement, as well as innovate new expressions of church.6 We need to develop entrepreneurial skills and strategies.</p>
<p>The Strange New World of Innovation In this and the previous chapter, we categorize apostolic leadership as being the archetypal pioneer/entrepreneurial form of leadership.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is composed of a number of key ingredients, including the capacity to take risks, develop ongoing and sustainable practices, and innovate.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we focus on innovation.</p>
<p>Negotiating the Intersection Contrary to what is generally thought, innovation is not the sole province of rare imaginative geniuses.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are such people, but there are more universal dynamics at work, ones that most of us can learn if we are willing to do so.</p>
<p>Something more generic than pure genius is at play in breakthrough creativity, and that something provides a clue to why apostolic people seem to be inherently innovative.</p>
<p>It is all about bringing what Richard Ogle calls different “idea spaces” together and managing the outcomes.7 So, for instance, in The Medici Effect, Frans Johansson credits the birth of the Renaissance to a wealthy dynasty that managed to bring a diverse range of artists, philosophers, musicians, financiers, poets, architects, and even scientists together in one place—Florence, Italy.</p>
<p>According to Johansson, it was the intersection of these fields and disciplines that provided the context, as well as the catalyst, for the cultural revolution that was the Renaissance and literally changed the course of history.</p>
<p>Johansson is absolutely right here: when existing ideas and concepts the spirit of innovation 187 collide to form new and unusual combinations, they create a spark for innovative thinking to take place.</p>
<p>He observes that when you step into an intersection of fields, disciplines, or cultures, you can combine existing concepts into a large number of extraordinary new ideas.</p>
<p>For instance, a person who immerses himself in a different culture experiences an extreme disorientation and is geared up for learning new things.</p>
<p>But he also brings new ideas into the host culture.</p>
<p>So for instance, “The mere fact that an individual is different from most people around him promotes more open and divergent, perhaps even rebellious, thinking in that person.</p>
<p>Such a person is more prone to question traditions, rules, and boundaries—and to search for answers where others may not think to.”8 This is an important clue for understanding the potential for innovation in apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>To be sure, apostolic people are partly wired for innovation, but the potential goes beyond innate capacity.</p>
<p>The translocal, cross-cultural feature of apostolic ministry arranges a collision of information to take place in both the apostle and the host culture.</p>
<p>It is this collision of gospel ideas and diverse human culture and experience that provides the essential spark for ecclesial innovation to take place.</p>
<p>We have already observed these dynamics in Paul: his theology, his methodology, and his creative ecclesiology.</p>
<p>Information technology guru Clay Shirky rightly notes that all good ideas have social origins.</p>
<p>He notes how people who cross over from one social group to another are more likely to think innovatively: People whose networks span structural holes have early access to diverse, often contradictory, information and interpretations which gives them a good competitive advantage in delivering good ideas.</p>
<p>People connected to groups beyond their own can expect to find themselves delivering valuable ideas, seeming to be gifted with creativity.</p>
<p>This is not creativity born of deep intellectual ability.</p>
<p>It is creativity as an import-export business.</p>
<p>An idea mundane in one group can be a valuable insight in another.9 I (Alan) can discern within my own life disparate experiences that have brought further insight into my task.</p>
<p>For one, I am Jewish and nurtured into a Jewish worldview.</p>
<p>This has meant that I bring a somewhat different perspective to the tasks than others tend to have due to the blind spots in their own worldview. I was not churched.</p>
<p>In fact, far from it. I was converted to Christ as a young adult.</p>
<p>Add to this that I have changed countries three times in my life (I was born and raised in South Africa, lived most of my life in Australia, and am now living 188 the permanent revolution in the United States), and mix with some pretty weird people at times (I go to Burning Man art festivals and the like), have a highly intuitive personality and lots of world travel: all that crossed together has produced an intersection in my own life that seems to be a seedbed of new possibilities.</p>
<p>No less is true for missionaries planting the gospel in other countries, as well as reaching out to people very different from themselves.</p>
<p>However, a mere collision of new and old thinking does not automatically produce innovation.</p>
<p>Someone must observe, interpret, and apply this collision.</p>
<p>Innovation rises when these new interpretations find a voice and are experimented with.</p>
<p>Innovators have the capacity to combine new parts with existing parts and rearrange those parts into new patterns.</p>
<p>As management guru Rosabeth Moss Kanter says, “It is as though they are looking at the world through a kaleidoscope, which creates endless variations on the same set of fragments.”10 Innovative breakthroughs largely come from seeing new possibilities in the relationships between seemingly disconnected things.</p>
<p>It does take imagination to be innovative, but such imagination is catalyzed by exposure to such conditions, and we all can do it.</p>
<p>To illustrate, I (Alan) was in a recent conversation about innovation with some senior church leaders.</p>
<p>We were talking about missional strategy, and the issue of innovation came up.</p>
<p>One of them stated adamantly that not everyone could be an innovator. I replied, “Unless their lives depended on it.” The point was taken.</p>
<p>Given the right conditions and contexts, everyone can be an innovator because every human has the gift of imagination.11 The intersection gives us our best chance to innovate.</p>
<p>The gift of imagination and intuition has a direct correlation to our ability to engage new ideas seriously, be exposed to out-of-the-ordinary experiences, and encounter different cultures and contexts.12 For instance, engaging a culture different from one’s own involves seeing how others process things differently, how they use different tools and technologies to solve problems, how and why they behave differently, and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, research indicates that people who have lived in multiple cultures are more likely to be innovators, which accounts in part for the massive increase in innovation in the past few decades.13 That Paul was raised Jewish but lived in non-Jewish settings and practiced his ministry across many cultures has everything to do with his capacity for innovation.</p>
<p>For one, he did not have a racially stereotypical view of Gentile culture.</p>
<p>And being fluent in Greek also meant that he was exposed to a different worldview from his native Jewish one.</p>
<p>Having studied Greek philosophy and observed Greek arts and poetry meant that he understood something of the existential issues faced in the culture (Acts 17:16–32). N. T.</p>
<p>Wright uses the metaphor of Greek and Jewish the spirit of innovation 189 ideas meeting like two tectonic plates throwing up the craggy mountain range we call New Testament theology.</p>
<p>His thinking was the direct result of an interplay between of two world views and cultures.14 Add to this his deep sense of calling to the nations, which he could translate in ways that his hearers could understand and respond to, and we can understand why Paul was so innovative.</p>
<p>He was a living intersection.</p>
<p>Beyond cultural experiences, recombinations of technologies alone are fertile ground for ideation.</p>
<p>For instance, Johannes Gutenberg combined the existing but unconnected technologies of the coin punch and the wine press (along with movable type) to create the printing press.</p>
<p>Facebook is simply a combination of the concept behind the college yearbook and the massive connectivity provided by the Internet.</p>
<p>We venture to suggest that in many ways, the megachurch movement arose in part from a willingness to combine the concept of the shopping mall with the local church and was driven by the newly rediscovered evangelistic impulse and fueled by the insights of marketing and the social sciences.</p>
<p>We all take it for granted now, but it was an innovation in its time.</p>
<p>All it takes is for people to be willing to allow the possibility of these recombinations to take place, to be playful, to allow the imagination to be stimulated, and not to be held by conformity to one way of doing things.</p>
<p>Social theorist Daniel Pink calls the kind of people who can do this “boundary crossers” because they often “reject either/or choices and seek multiple options and blended solutions.” They are open-ended and “lead hyphenated lives filled with hyphenated jobs and are enlivened by hyphenated identities.”15 Innovation is not genius; it comes from a willingness to learn and explore possibility without recourse to the prevailing repertoire of solutions.</p>
<p>To be sure, novelty, change, and unfamiliar environments can stress some of us, but they stimulate others, including apostolic types.</p>
<p>Because the apostle’s key task is to translate and embed the gospel faithfully into new cultural contexts, they have to be productive and cannot rely on old solutions.</p>
<p>They need to have the innate or learned capacity to capture the innovative possibilities that come about when two entirely different and previously unrelated idea spaces intersect.</p>
<p>In other words, as the church’s natural pioneers, apostles have instinctive leaderplex—the capacity to process and reorganize new and existing information, recognize and adopt new social patterns and roles, and ultimately translate these new elements into innovative practices and behaviors.</p>
<p>This apostolic open-endedness and the highly stimulating and missional context that the intersection provides create the conditions for ecclesial novelty to emerge.</p>
<p>And this holds promise for the extension of Christianity as well as its renewal. 190 the permanent revolution Living with Ambiguity Human life as a whole is one vast ambiguity lived out in an equally immense unknown.</p>
<p>For instance, who can predict the outcomes of a single day?</p>
<p>This ambiguity makes us insecure.</p>
<p>We do not like the fact that we are not in control, so we take refuge in past successes and formulas rather than search for new ones, even though we know that better options can be found should we be committed enough to search for them.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the greatest characteristics of apostolic pioneerinnovators is their seemingly innate capacity to live, even thrive, in the face of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Even as they learn from the past, they tend to be more future oriented, and that makes them better able to cope with the ambiguities of the human condition.</p>
<p>In fact with the right mind-set, ambiguity itself is fertile ground for new discoveries because it means being less set in our ways and thinking.</p>
<p>Columbus set out looking for India; instead he discovered the New World.</p>
<p>And like Columbus, true pioneer-innovators have the ability to live with the various unknowns that make up their world.</p>
<p>Paul in 2 Corinthians amply demonstrates this capacity to live in an almost constant ambiguous state.</p>
<p>In fact, 2 Corinthians 1 alone is exhausting to most of us who struggle with similar conditions.</p>
<p>Faith is nurtured in such conditions.</p>
<p>Innovation, especially in the beginning stages, or what some call the fuzzy front end, is saturated in ambiguity (Figure 9.1).</p>
<p>At this phase of innovation, nothing has totally taken shape, and there are more questions than answers and fuzzy outlines but not fully defined shapes.</p>
<p>With Ambiguity disassociated ideas playful potential Clarity associated ideas realized possibility the spirit of innovation 191 brainstorming and refinement, this ambiguous phase eventually gives way to a clearly defined prototype that is ready for experimentation.</p>
<p>Granger Community Church, an American United Methodist megachurch in Granger, Indiana, has an open-ended experimental program that is spearheading efforts to reinvent itself beyond the home base church.</p>
<p>So does Community Christian Church in Chicago.</p>
<p>Although people are encouraged to experiment, they are not entirely sure of what will emerge.</p>
<p>The ambiguous, fuzzy front end is the necessary, and perhaps even annoying, phase of the innovation process, yet no innovation is possible without it.</p>
<p>At this stage, the innovator has to take a counterintuitive approach of deferring judgment, embracing uncertainty, and exploring all options.</p>
<p>Ambiguity calls for listening and waiting, not immediate action— hence, the concept of ambiguity tolerance.</p>
<p>New possibilities bubble up when we resist the urge to define and categorize problems and their solutions too quickly.</p>
<p>Innovation and creativity need ambiguity to flourish.</p>
<p>We have to starve our cravings to impose order, close boundaries, and map out every detail before we begin the journey.</p>
<p>We have to delay closure so that new possibilities have a chance to emerge.16 Thinking Like a Beginner, Not an Expert Innovation usually arises out of a sense of need, sometimes bordering on desperation.</p>
<p>So, for instance, living systems theory consistently maintains that the sweet spot of innovation takes place at the edge of chaos or on what has also been called the burning platform—situations where the organization is threatened with possible dissolution.</p>
<p>Donald Kuratko, a scholar of entrepreneurship, notes that certain environmental factors force people to be creative.</p>
<p>One major factor is displacement: political, cultural, economic, or geographical.17 Being placed into radically new contexts requires an almost total relearning of everything we thought we knew.</p>
<p>As we have seen, we might have been experts in our own culture, but when we are in a completely alien one, we have to start again.</p>
<p>This can trigger the innovative spirit, because such displacement puts a person or an organization in the cultural intersection of an environment that creates the possibility of opportunity recognition, as well as in a place to go on a learning journey.</p>
<p>We therefore suggest that one of the key rules of innovation is to place yourself in situations where you have to learn to think like a beginner, not an expert.</p>
<p>At Forge Mission Training Network, we take this principle seriously.</p>
<p>To train new leaders to think and act missionally, we require them to step out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>If they are not out of their comfort zone, all they 192 the permanent revolution will learn is what they already know—in other words, they are experts in what they already know.</p>
<p>However by placing themselves at risk (that is, a situation that is largely unfamiliar), thereby increasing the possibility of failure, the intern has to learn to think like a beginner or fail.</p>
<p>Getting Over the “F” Word Groundbreaking innovators always experience more failure than their more conventional counterparts do because they experiment more often.</p>
<p>Wayne Gretzky, the great Canadian hockey player, said: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” Anyone pursuing innovative forms of mission has to embrace the reality that not all experiments succeed.</p>
<p>If we are not willing to face the possibility of failure and keep moving, we will never enter into innovative forms of mission or new forms of ecclesia.</p>
<p>What we really need is a new way of defining success and failure.</p>
<p>When innovation becomes an essential ingredient in what it means to be missional, then a refusal to innovate and experiment becomes the most potent definition of failure.</p>
<p>Success means embracing risk and launching into the frontiers of mission.</p>
<p>We need to begin celebrating the people who are willing to say, “Let’s try it!” as well as the people who come out on the other end saying, “We did it!” Improvisation: Innovating as You Go Improvisation involves learning to build the plane as you are flying it, managing in a makeshift way when things do not go according to plan, learning to make do with whatever is at hand.</p>
<p>This is a key part of innovative apostolic leadership.</p>
<p>All of us know of churches that started with a commitment to reach unchurched people but ended up simply attracting other Christians.</p>
<p>Because of financial pressures, it becomes more feasible to cater to already churched people.</p>
<p>But the result is a loss of mission, and the associated innovation, as the church veers toward what is known and therefore to the conventional.</p>
<p>Many times real innovation is short-circuited because of a loss of vision, nerve, and an inability to improvise.</p>
<p>To be innovative in such situations requires staying true to the original missional focus and seeing it through.</p>
<p>The word improvisation has its roots in the word provisio, which means to supply something in advance, before it is needed, or to do something premeditated.</p>
<p>Putting the prefix im before the word means that you are describing the opposite of provisio.</p>
<p>Improvisation is tied in with the spirit of innovation 193 the unseen, the unexpected.</p>
<p>Being able to improvise means being able to adjust plans in response to unforeseen circumstances and conditions.</p>
<p>Innovator Paul Berliner defines it this way: “Improvisation involves reworking pre-composed material and designs in relation to unanticipated ideas, conceived, shaped and transformed, under the special conditions of performance, thereby adding unique features to every creation.”18 Think of jazz, which involves making music as it unravels.</p>
<p>It is music on demand.</p>
<p>Although it does follow certain guidelines that provide the superstructure, the musical content itself is largely unplanned and happens in the moment.</p>
<p>Formulating strategies in the context of performing them is one of the most fertile ways to arrive at success.</p>
<p>But it requires leadership, flexibility, a tolerance for ambiguity, and a willingness to fail.</p>
<p>There is truth in the idea that form follows failure only if improvisation is part of the equation.</p>
<p>Revising a strategy halfway through is not only a sign of good learning; it is essential to being adaptable, which in apostolic ministry is the short-term means to the ends of long-term effectiveness.</p>
<p>Another way of describing improvisation is as continuous (or incremental) design.</p>
<p>Rather than specifying the system completely before development starts, this involves creating or modifying a system as it is being developed, in iterative bursts along the way.</p>
<p>Organizational strategist Karl Weick explains it well: “Design, viewed from the perspective of improvisation, is more emergent, more continuous, more filled with surprise, more difficult to control, more tied to the content of action....</p>
<p>Emergent, continuous designing is sensitive to small changes in local conditions, which means the design continuously updates as people and conditions change.”19 This squares well with both the nature and practice of apostolic leadership and incarnational mission.</p>
<p>Because apostolic ministry is design focused (that is, architectural) and is also highly sensitive to context and locality, it is likely to be incremental and iterative.</p>
<p>Apostolic leaders need to be what Donald Schön called “reflective practitioners”: “The practitioner allows himself to experience surprise, puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique.</p>
<p>He reflects on the phenomenon before him, and on the prior understandings which have been implicit in his behavior.</p>
<p>He carries out an experiment which serves to generate both a new understanding of the phenomenon and a change in the situation.”20 Front-loading missional projects with detailed blueprints for action may well bolster confidence in the beginning, but this kind of planning assumes too much about the intricate cultural nuances of the target context and will be unlikely to generate innovation.</p>
<p>Church planting and leading an 194 the permanent revolution apostolic movement have got to be more improvisatory.</p>
<p>No one can know all the variables until they immerse themselves in that context and begin to act intentionally within it.</p>
<p>It does not mean starting without a plan; it just means those plans need to be somewhat more open-ended and nimble.</p>
<p>When Jesus sends out his disciples with nothing other than what they have in their hands (Luke 9:1–10), he sets them up to experience their ministries as an open-ended improvisation.</p>
<p>They are not given a model, they are given a mission, and they will have to make it up as they go.</p>
<p>Missionary and Missional Innovation Leaders can be innovative in many ways, but this does not necessarily mean that they are apostolic.</p>
<p>So what does a distinctly apostolic form of innovation look like, and how can it be encouraged and developed?</p>
<p>Once again, the clue to this answer is found in the distinctive role of the apostolic person as custodian of the DNA of God’s people.</p>
<p>This is manifested through the apostolic focus on extending the impact of the Christian movement through mission, maintaining the integrity of the movement in relation to its core DNA, and providing the overall context for the other ministries to emerge in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>We mention these here because the apostolic person has absolutely no mandate to tamper with the DNA itself—apostles are mere custodians, not generators, of that DNA—but they do have to be thoroughly innovative in two major ways.</p>
<p>The two basic forms of, and contexts for, apostolic innovation are in the mission field as the gospel is extended into new contexts and cultures (what we call missionary innovation) and in search of new forms of ecclesia and methods for existing churches (what we call missional innovation). MIS SIONA RY IN NOVATION.</p>
<p>What works in one context might not necessarily work in another.</p>
<p>In fact, an application of a previous ecclesial algorithm might even have the opposite effect to what was intended.</p>
<p>Besides being plainly culturally imperialistic, ill-fitting approaches violate the central New Testament teaching of the Incarnation of God in Jesus Christ, one of the most important doctrines that should inform every aspect of the way we conceive of and do mission.</p>
<p>If to incarnate (to en-flesh) is the way that God has chosen to engage the world (and it plainly is) and if we as his people are called to follow in the ways of Jesus, then we too must adopt an incarnational approach to mission: “As the Father sent me, so I send you” (John 20:21).</p>
<p>The Father sent Jesus into the world as a complete human being, who lived the spirit of innovation 195 incognito as a Jew among the Jewish people, spoke their language, ate their food, sang their songs, and participated as a Jew in Jewish blood and history.</p>
<p>He was of the line of David and from the tribe of Judah, born in Bethlehem at a distinct time.</p>
<p>From within this particular humanity, God chose to redeem the world, and this must forever change the way we think of God.</p>
<p>This informs the meaning of the as in the verse just quoted.</p>
<p>We are to do what we do in the way that Jesus did what he did: incarnationally.</p>
<p>If we allow the Incarnation in Jesus to shape our understanding of and approach to sharing the good news, as it must, then we must step outside our predetermined patterns and algorithms and learn how to transmit the gospel from within a given culture.</p>
<p>All Pauline apostles have to be innovators because they are tasked with transmitting the gospel meaningfully into a given culture and ensuring that a genuinely indigenous church emerges from it.</p>
<p>This requires innovation.</p>
<p>The role of innovation in mission strategy and methodology ensures that the gospel is embedded in ways that can reproduce virally within that culture.</p>
<p>This is precisely the dilemma we are facing here in the West.</p>
<p>Our old forms are no longer working.</p>
<p>We need new forms that have reproducibility (or scalability) built into their basic core.</p>
<p>This requires an apostolically inclined leadership.</p>
<p>Once again, Paul shows us the way.</p>
<p>We can observe such incarnational methodology and innovation from the way he goes about fulfilling his apostolic calling.</p>
<p>For instance, in Athens, he starts by exegeting the culture through an analysis of their current idols, a sure way to identify their yearnings and aspirations, as well as the Resulting gaps in their attempts to connect with and experience something outside and above themselves.</p>
<p>He ends with a proclamation of the Resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>He takes local culture seriously enough to study their religion (their idolatrous forms), philosophy, art, and poetry.</p>
<p>He uses a totally different method when preaching in Jerusalem or in the synagogues; there, he exegetes the scriptures and their messianic threads and ends up with contemporary culture, with the messianic fulfillment in Jesus (Acts 13:13–42).</p>
<p>By thus communicating from within either culture, Paul establishes a natural beachhead for the gospel in different contexts.</p>
<p>So from context to context, Paul developed new ways of speaking about Jesus that translated the core meanings of the gospel into existing cultural frameworks.</p>
<p>The challenge is to bring the two “texts” of (biblical) text and (cultural) context into dynamic relationship so that the gospel can be transferred meaningfully into the culture.</p>
<p>Apostles, in whatever context, must be specialists in culture and gospel, anthropology and atonement.</p>
<p>New 196 the permanent revolution Testament scholars Joel Green and Mark Baker describe how Paul contextualized the gospel in various locales: As he moves from community to community, Paul weaves a theological language that moves between the story of Israel as this is reflected in and interpreted by the advent of Christ, on the one hand, and the exigencies and settings of his audiences on the other.</p>
<p>In this way, language takes shape within an ongoing conversation, as language is adopted and adapted that both fits the particular circumstances to which Paul addresses himself and toils to reconfigure experienced reality so that it accounts more fully for what God has done in Christ.</p>
<p>This means that Paul can use one set of metaphors with the Colossians, another with the Galatians, while remaining true to the gospel and bearing witness to the same actuality ... he throws himself into the difficult but crucial task of serving as a midwife to a conversion of worldview.21 Missiologist Dean Flemming also asserts that contextualization goes beyond crafting a culturally relevant message.</p>
<p>It involves “the dynamic and comprehensive process by which the gospel is incarnated within a concrete, historical or cultural situation.”22 Incarnational mission, by its very nature, sparks missional innovation.</p>
<p>In Figure 9.2, which shows the dual process of incarnational contextualization and missional innovation, innovation (the internal circle) follows a similar pathway as the process of contextualizing the gospel and church into a given context (the outer square) and in fact takes place within the broader context of the process of incarnating and contextualizing the gospel.</p>
<p>Certainly both involve learning, conceptualizing, doing, and embodying.</p>
<p>It can be seen how the two different but profoundly interrelated are parts of the same movement.</p>
<p>For instance, IDEO, arguably America’s best design firm, maintains that all innovation starts with a serious commitment to observe without recourse to solving the problem; it therefore requires a primary posture of learning and listening.</p>
<p>Innovation then moves into a phase of interpreting the data, gleaning insights, discerning opportunities, synthesizing the information, and deciphering the culture codes to find doorways and keys to the culture (or market, depending on context.) These in turn lead directly to the dynamic process of ideation, prototyping a model, formally researching, and deciding on an approach.</p>
<p>The final phase involves testing and applying the idea or product: refining, optimizing, and readjusting until it is optimized.23 the spirit of innovation 197 1.</p>
<p>Immerse Identify cultural openings Decipher codes Observe cultural codes Empathic listening Brainstorm and ideate Develop mental model Circle of and pilot Improvise and adjust Start here!</p>
<p>Conceptual (Mapping) Real (Concretizing) It is not hard to see the correlation between best practice in innovation and the missionary process by which the gospel is planted and the ecclesia allowed to develop.</p>
<p>Although it does not use the same language, Church Multiplication Associates trains people to follow the same basic pathways.24 All best practice missionary work does the same thing.</p>
<p>All this highlights how the new missional situation we face in the West means that we have to learn the skills of innovation.</p>
<p>In fact, the greater the contrast is between the culture of the (missionary) messenger and the (cultural) receivers, the greater will be the need for missional innovation to take place.</p>
<p>Apostolic strategist David Watson honors the incarnational-innovational approach when he says, “Their culture and structure should determine our strategy and approach.”25 Approaches that forgo this process of contextualization and innovation will end up either simply imposing previous (traditional) algorithms on a group or opt for some form of ecclesial franchising.</p>
<p>Although these might be effective in contexts where people are within the church’s cultural orbit (for example, highly churched settings like the American Midwest and South) in a genuinely unchurched setting, it actually works directly against the goals and methods of incarnational mission.</p>
<p>Think of 198 the permanent revolution European liturgies and ecclesiology, developed over centuries in Europe, formulaically applied in the middle of Africa.</p>
<p>They are imposed on a people, not grown from among the people, and end up violating a people’s natural faith posture toward God.</p>
<p>The same applies to a Southern Baptist missionary to San Francisco trying to use what works in South Carolina or street preaching, which might have worked in the revivals in Old West but today likely produces the opposite effect intended, offending people rather than bringing them closer to Jesus.</p>
<p>There is something deeply wrong about all forms of ecclesial imperialism that so easily violate the very meaning of the Incarnation and its significance for how we should live in the world.</p>
<p>Apostolic leadership must first ensure that the gospel is properly communicated and contextualized.</p>
<p>Only once the gospel is truly transmitted, received, and embedded do they seek to encourage new, indigenous forms of Christian community that naturally emerge from an authentic encounter between Jesus and the people.</p>
<p>This is at the core of the apostolic task in the missionary environment: to plant the gospel with the understanding that if we do our part, Jesus will build his church (Matthew 16:18, 28:16–20). MISSIONA L I NNOVATION.</p>
<p>The kind of innovation needed to keep the established church relevant and actively engaged in its current context and situation is most suited for the Petrine forms of apostleship, which work primarily with and through the established people of God.</p>
<p>It has been said that the best way to preserve tradition is to have children, not to wear your father’s old hat, but it seems that we have tended to believe that the old hat is what we are called to wear.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Certainly we are called to remember the covenants God made with his people, but we are called to do this in dynamic tension with what it means to participate in the ever-urgent not yet of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Because the church is a sign, symbol, and foretaste of the kingdom of God, it is ever the agent of the kingdom that operates in and through it.</p>
<p>Until such time as the kingdom is fulfilled, the movement that Jesus started will always need to be looking for ways in which to be more faithful and true to its calling.</p>
<p>We are not called to remember the covenants simply as tradition but rather as the basis of a living relationship between God and his people, then and now.</p>
<p>This is a relationship that we testify to every day with our lives and our witness.</p>
<p>How did we ever get to believe that faithfulness involved simply retaining past forms and thinking?</p>
<p>With the Creator God as our Father, how did we ever become the socially conservative stiflers of innovation that we are so notoriously perceived to be? the spirit of innovation 199 It goes without saying that in a fallen world everything tends to wind down, and what resonates strongly in one generation might likely miss the next one by a mile; generation gaps are classic examples of serious missiological problems.</p>
<p>One culture can completely miss another.</p>
<p>Symbols and ideas that were once vibrant become bankrupt when they no longer convey the right meanings as a result of the changing environment and changing conditions.</p>
<p>The same is true of the cultural forms of ecclesia.</p>
<p>As we have already noted, failure to regularly innovate inevitably results in cloying traditionalism, theological stagnation, cultural isolation, and, inevitably, organizational decline.</p>
<p>The church and its peoples need ongoing theological and spiritual renewal, which necessitates a near-constant search for new and better ways to be the church that Jesus intended.</p>
<p>Truly ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda; the church reformed ought always to be reforming.</p>
<p>Innovation is deeply rooted in our theology.</p>
<p>In fact, we can basically acknowledge that simply to encounter God is to change; it will always require change in us, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote.</p>
<p>Erwin McManus, leader of the creative church movement called Mosaic, rightly sees God as both the originator of change and the one who demands it from us.</p>
<p>He points out that many of the most important words in the scriptures (repentance, justification, conversion, discipleship, new life, sanctification) involve movement and change.</p>
<p>He then goes on to encourage leaders to keep up with the leadership of God in this matter by promoting innovation and embracing a culture of change: Everywhere God moves, there is change.</p>
<p>Everywhere God moves, he creates the future.</p>
<p>Everywhere God moves, hope is alive and well.</p>
<p>The church must be grounded in a proper theology of change, not simply to address the radically changing world in which we live, but to advance the cause of Christ in a world that cannot produce the real change that has to take place.</p>
<p>Remember that momentum is related to the distance covered in a certain period of time.</p>
<p>For the church, momentum is more about time than distance.</p>
<p>When we do not change, we actually distance ourselves from the world around us.</p>
<p>When we cling to the past, we create distance between ourselves and what God is doing in the present.26 While all the APEST ministries need to be active and engaged to keep the church on track, spiritually and missionally, much of the pressure for change and innovation will likely come from the combination of the 200 the permanent revolution prophet as the provocateur who reminds us of our need to change and the apostle who in all likelihood will act as the key entrepreneur, change agent, and manager.</p>
<p>However, we believe that innovation itself will most likely come from apostolic leadership for at least three reasons: Their role as re/founders.</p>
<p>Genuine apostolic people are radical traditionalists; they operate from the central core of ideas and radically but consistently reapply these ideas in different contexts.</p>
<p>They are the ones charged with the primary custody of our defining concepts that keep us being the church that Jesus intended and thus maintaining theological validity.</p>
<p>This is the all-important DNA checkup that we need to keep us from becoming pragmatic faddists and novelty seekers, both of which distort the truth of the church rather than extend it.</p>
<p>Whatever we do must have a deep congruency with our core beliefs and founding ideas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the resident radical traditionalist, the apostolic leader is also the mediator of the systemic renewal process that we called refounding the church (see Chapter Seven), a process that takes our deepest ideas and reinterprets them in new ways and forms.</p>
<p>The former requires theological intelligence, while the latter requires explicit innovative skills.</p>
<p>The systemic scope of their function.</p>
<p>The combination of the architectural nature of their ministry and their missional commitment to advance Christianity as a fully integrated religious system onto new ground aids apostles in their primary responsibility for ensuring the ongoing development and extension of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>They are best able to evaluate and jettison decaying forms as well as cultivate the development of new ones.</p>
<p>Their oversight of the missional cause.</p>
<p>They are the sent ones who keep up the pressure for missional advancement by virtue of their calling.</p>
<p>It is not claiming too much to say that mission is not only the mother of theology; it is also the mother of ecclesial innovation.</p>
<p>Mission by its nature exerts a constant pressure for innovation, and so most breakthroughs in thinking and methodology come from missionary innovation.</p>
<p>Because Pauline apostles are likely to engage directly in missionary situations, they can mediate the learning from the edge of the frontier to the rest of the movement—an element critical for learning, renewal, and development.</p>
<p>But Petrine apostles also generate innovation by constantly (re)aligning the movement around its missional theology and cause.</p>
<p>Authentic missional pressure from within will also generate ideation the spirit of innovation 201 throughout as the church seeks to find new and better ways to be who Jesus intended we should be in the first place.</p>
<p>Innovation thrives from an apostolic vision of the church that encompasses holy discontent, constant change, adaptability, and development.</p>
<p>If the church is simply a place where believers are cared for (a kind of pastoral hospital) and taught the basics of the faith (an extension of the seminary), then it will likely lack the energy needed to generate new ideas and forms and the courage required to implement them.</p>
<p>Every advancement of the church is predicated on having a transformative vision of the world.</p>
<p>This in turn has a transforming effect on the church itself: we become a movement. ‌part four Movements R Us thinking and acting like a movement Our nature lies in movement, complete calm is death.</p>
<p>Of course a movement must be embodied in some organized form, but once Christians had begun to think of the Church as a structure to be compared with and related to other structures in society, it became one of the very principalities and powers that the Gospel was supposed to withstand.

<p>Taylor The life I touch for good or ill will touch another life, and that in turn another, until who knows where the trembling stops or in what far place my touch will be felt. THE COMMONWEALTH OF OCEANA by james harrington was published in England in 1656.</p>
<p>Despite its controversial story line, it managed to escape full-blown censorship by the order of Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>Harrington’s fortunate connection with one of Cromwell’s daughters somehow created space for the novel to pass through the printing press and into the hands of the common people.</p>
<p>What made his novel so controversial is not just that was a thinly veiled caricature of England’s government but that it proposed an alternate way of organizing the state that gave power back to the people.</p>
<p>After describing the governments of ancient Israel, Rome, Sparta, and Venice, Harrington painted a picture of an imaginary island, called Oceana, that had an alternative way of organizing.</p>
