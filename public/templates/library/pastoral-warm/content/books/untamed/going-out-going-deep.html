<h1>Going Out, Going Deep</h1>
<p>The reality of the Son of God, true God entering our humanity, is astounding, humbling, and mysterious.</p>
<p>—Dan Russ To be a follower of Christ does not mean to imitate literally but to express him through the medium of one’s own life.</p>
<p>A Christian is no unnatural reproduction of Christ.... The task of the Christian consists of transposing Christ into the stuff of his own daily existence.</p>
<p>—Romano Guardini The one thing that we can’t bear for Jesus to be is ordinary, for his ordinariness invites us to follow him by providing us with a template of how to be Godlike even as an ordinary human being.</p>

<p>The incarnation provided believers with a wonderful and completely definitive understanding of God. N. T. Wright suggests that we must again and again look “into the human face of Jesus of Nazareth, until the awesome knowledge comes over us, wave upon terrifying wave, that we are looking into the human face of the living God.”1 This gazing into the human face of the God-Man Jesus is absolutely critical for us to get a true understanding of what it means to be an untamed disciple in the way of Jesus. T</p>
<p>We are really excited about the fact that so many Christians are now engaged in aspects of the missional conversation; the church in our day is increasingly adopting a missiological understanding of itself, and individual Christians are also beginning to realize that every one of us is sent by Jesus into the world—in other words, that we are all missionaries.</p>
<p>Mission is no longer merely relegated to a minority subcommittee with a view to overseas mission alone. All this is good, but in our opinion there is one more step required if we are going to become a truly untamed movement—we must embrace the full missional implications of the incarnation. If incarnation is the most profound way that God engaged the world, then we, his people, must follow in his footsteps—we must become incarnation-al. If missional defines our being sent out into the world, then incarnational must define the way in which we engage the world. going out, going deep</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The incarnation of God in Jesus causes us to see the world
in a different light—it changes our perspectives on God, dis-
cipleship, culture, and mission. Call it a missional mode,
incarnate the gospel among the people we are seeking to
incarnation... or it won’t. If a church displays a sign out
in the community around them, but their message will fall on
communicate everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our ministry with Forge Missional Training Network, one of our core emphases is on developing leaders in incarnational ways of doing mission. We use six incarnational discipleship practices called “the six P’s” to help embed incarnational mission into the life of the intern: presence, proximity, powerlessness, prevenience, proclamation, and passion.2 What we want to do in this chapter is simply suggest these as practices we should adopt if we are to engage the world in ways that are more consistent with our Lord.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Practice of Presence</li>
</ol>
<p>This missional stance draws inspiration from the fact that God was fully present in the incarnation of Jesus. Jesus was not merely some representative of God, a prophet, or an angel. He was God, 100 percent, fully present, in human flesh (John 1:1–16; Col. 1:15–20; Heb. 1:1–4; 1 John 1:1–3).</p>
<p>If God is one of us, he knows our situation, our struggles, our yearnings, our temptations, our bodily functions and limitations (such as aging), and so on from direct experience (Heb. 4:14–16). It’s hard to comprehend the meaning of this profound act of identification with us. At the very least it means he knows us, loves us, and has our very best interests at heart. We can trust him. the untamed mission We believe that an incarnational stance is an extremely important aspect of missional lifestyle. As God identified with us, so ought we identify with others. This will mean taking a given culture or people group seriously and deeply investing in them. We will need to take significant time to understand their history, their stories, their heroes, their books, and so on, in order to get their take on things. It is about immersing ourselves into their lives.
Lawrence and Louise Hirsch and family (Al’s brother and sister-in-law) give us a great example of what it means to identify with a given culture. Following Paul’s exhortation to reach the Jew first and then the Gentiles, they started a ministry in Melbourne, Australia, called Celebrate Messiah.</p>
<p>It is an outreach to Jewish people and has had an incredible impact on the Jewish community in Melbourne. They have planted two churches so far and have seen hundreds of Jewish people come to know their Messiah. Beyond this, there is now evidence that Messianic Judaism is actually being considered to be a living part of the local Jewish life.</p>
<p>These Jewish believers see themselves as fulfilled Jews and continue on with many of their traditions. Of course, there are Gentiles present, but in order to identify with the Jewish people they have adopted many of the outward forms of the Jewish culture. This means that most congregants have Shabbat meals every Friday evening and celebrate Passover and all of the other feasts. Following Jewish customs, forms, and rituals, they meet for worship on Saturdays rather than Sunday. In spite of the fact that the wider Jewish community struggles to integrate them because of the historical antiSemitism of the church, the members of Celebrate Messiah see themselves as part of the broader Jewish community in the city, and their impact is felt throughout.</p>
<p>This incarnational approach to mission is evident among many missionaries to Muslim contexts. For instance, we know of a group called Frontier Servants who, in order going out, going deep to identify with Muslim people, have for all intents and purposes actually become Muslims. Following Jesus (Isa in Arabic), they moved into the community, adopted the culture, customs, dress codes, and aspects of the religion where these did not conflict with explicit teaching of the Bible. One of them is now the official prison chaplain for Muslims in Melbourne prisons. This type of identification was particularly costly for the women, as they had to give up some of the basic freedoms Western women take for granted.</p>
<p>Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23 that he sought to become all things to all people in order to save some. Now, this might beg the question of how far we go in our attempt to identify and present the gospel in terms that people can understand. No doubt there are some limits. But if we are serious about identifying with a given people group, there is going to be a cost, whether that be in adopting a culture not our own or giving up personal freedoms. So be it.</p>
<p>But incarnational living need not necessarily be with another racial group. It can and must include the myriad subcultures in any Western city. It should also include various suburban settings, such as businesses, sports clubs, and so on.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Practice of Proximity</li>
</ol>
<p>This practice is largely focused around issues of what we do about geographic setting and relational closeness. Once again it draws its inspiration from God’s action in Jesus.</p>
<p>God became a man not only in order to identify with us (presence), but also to live with and among us! He was no recluse, keeping a safe distance; he literally immersed himself in people. Much of his time was spent just hanging out and getting to know the people around him. Jesus didn’t expect people to come to where he was, as we so often do, but rather went to them. He hung out in their social spaces, markets, the untamed mission and synagogues, and visited their homes. In other words, he came into direct proximity; he was near to them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Having seen what Jeff does firsthand, we are truly amazed going out, going deep what a shift in proximity can accomplish. In a few short years, Jeff has built relationships with people who would never have darkened the doorsteps of a church. He leads several groups of not-yet-Christians in cool bohemian pubs and housing developments, and the homeless in parks. One group has recently identified itself as a church and adopted the name Holy Chaos, which is appropriate given the wild lives of some of the people. JFor our primary calling to more marginal groups, a commitment to proximity meant that we relocated to the local red-light and gay area of our city. On the one side of our house is a heroin rehab facility, and on the other the “working stroll” of some of the local street prostitutes. Across the road are boarding houses for semi-homeless people, many struggling with mental health issues, and a famous “drag queen” bar on the corner. Being located in this environment meant that we could not but see the world differently. Every time we went out our front door, we were reminded of a broken and lost humanity and the issues that confront the mission of the church.</p>
<p>Obviously this view is utterly different from that of a middle-class suburb. There are real needs in a middle-class suburb, but for many cultural reasons those needs are much the untamed mission more hidden and enclosed in privacy. People are very busy, so they don’t tend to socialize much outside of a very narrow group of friends. The practice of proximity in the suburbs will mean that the disciple will need to be far more creative in getting beneath the surface, in actively building meaningful relationships and developing a context of trust in order to touch base with the needs of the people. We know of missional disciples who variously host regular street parties, train people in the art of recycling, run mother’s groups outside of Christian circles, organize backyard blitzes (cleaning, painting, gardening), adopt and maintain local parks, provide chaplaincy wherever needed, and use myriad other ways to engage people in the burbs.</p>
<p>Whatever the context, followers of Jesus will need to make very intentional choices about where we position ourselves so that we can see and respond to the need around us. Being incarnational is about how we live out what it means to be little Jesuses in the community we are in. For each of us this will look and feel very different, as there are many aspects to being the hands, heart, and feet of Christ in a given context.</p>
<p>The places we find ourselves, whether through circumstance (for example, Paul in prison) or through the choices we make about where we decide to set up home (be it in the suburbs, urban settings, or the slums of India), will to some degree determine our perspectives and actions. And how we live out the Incarnation will look very different depending on the context God has called us to.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Practice of Powerlessness</li>
</ol>
<p>While we can probably find many images in our culture of powerlessness, perhaps none is more obvious than that of a baby whose survival is totally dependent on others. Therefore, to think of Jesus as a dependent, vulnerable, and even needy baby is perhaps one of the most difficult things to going out, going deep grasp in God becoming man. Dan Russ rightly notes that when we reflect on the humanity of Jesus, our minds most easily leap to Jesus as a mature man.5 But Jesus didn’t come to us as a grown man. In order to fully identify with us, he literally came into the world as we do, born as a dependent, vulnerable child.</p>
<p>The great challenge for us is to recognize that to be weak, needy, and even powerless is part of the human condition, not something to be abhorred. When we give up our sense of power and control, we can truly become human in a way that conforms to the image of Christ.</p>
<p>One of the most amazing things we can say about Jesus (and therefore God) is that he is actually humble! The creator of all things is humble! We know this through what theologians call “his humiliation,” powerfully described in Philippians 2. In Jesus, God does not come as an invading tyrant, but in the humblest of forms: the servant. This was not very “cool” in the Roman empire, as the slave was the lowest in the pecking order. This says a lot about God. But it ought to say a lot about us as well. “Every true follower of Christ must, through his own existence, try to express the same fact, that humility and self-denial are inseparable from the Christian life.”6 So many of the sins of the historical church could have been avoided if we had simply understood this fact. There have been times when the last thing people would have called Christians is humble. We have been highly coercive, often unkind, and repeatedly judgmental.
When one applies this to our missionary calling in the world, it means that we come very humbly among a group of people. Like Jesus, we don’t come into town wielding a sword (or a stick, for that matter) or riding in like the cavalry. Nor do we come legislating people’s morals or flouting celebrity, money, and ego. Rather, we come to subvert evil the untamed mission and brokenness through Christlike service. Following our humble Lord, we can never approach incarnational mission from an arrogant perspective. Missional disciples must not expect to conquer by power or by force; they must use the same means as Jesus: steadfastness in the truth, acceptance of being misunderstood and rejected, and a willingness to achieve victory through redemptive suffering. This is a dreadfully difficult lesson for us to learn.
4. The Practice of Prevenience</p>
<p>If you reflect back on our personal stories in the Introduction, you might notice that both of us were involved in lifestyles that were removed from the influence of the church. Both of us had some sort of sensitivity to God and, strangely enough, both of us can testify to direct God experiences in and through drugs that eventually led us to Jesus! Many people might balk at this, but for us it is simply a fact. And it is not really all that strange; insofar as taking drugs is a search for ecstasy, for otherness, they are part of a person’s spiritual quest. Many can get totally lost in this, and we believe most do, but we cannot exclude the spiritual factor in the equation. Both of us found that God (the true God—is there any other?) did speak to us even in the strangest moments and the weirdest drug-induced conversations.</p>
<p>The truth is that God doesn’t limit his presence to baptized Christians—he is an unrelenting evangelist. He is always at work in his world—right in the thick of things—in sinful people’s lives, including our own. Not all respond appropriately, but that doesn’t seem to put our God off very much— he’s persistent, he’s insistent, and he’s got a lot of mercy.</p>
<p>John Wesley called this reality “prevenient grace” (preparatory grace), and he built his entire ministry squarely on it!</p>
<p>He really believed that God was always preparing the way going out, going deep for the preaching of the gospel, that he was at work in every person, wooing them into relationship in and through Jesus.</p>
<p>It is sound biblical doctrine. We don’t “bring God” with us into any situation—he’s there long before you or I arrive on the scene. We simply need to discern God’s prevenient work in people’s lives and join with him. All of us are living testaments to this truth.</p>
<p>We have since come to understand that many people have God-moments, or what are sometimes called “theophanies,” in their lives. Atheophany is some form of religious experience, a manifestation of God, that could be prompted, for instance, by watching a sunset: suddenly the wonder of it all dawns on a person—time seems to stand still and eternity fills the moment.</p>
<p>On other occasions, it could be in conversations—in a moment of in-breaking revelation, a significant truth dawns upon a person. This is what poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called an “inscape,” and many people experience these at some time or another. As agents of Jesus, we can draw upon these experiences and give them their true meaning by directing people to the One who is the fulfillment of all human longing.</p>
<p>Afunny story illustrates this idea of prevenient grace: in 2001 we bought a café-nightclub in order to set up a “proximity space” in one of the entertainment districts of our city. We both worked there in various capacities: bartender, waiter, manager, cook. One night, after Deb was closing up, she bumped into an anxious guy named Jason who asked her if she was “working.” Deb immediately checked to see what she was wearing, thinking he had mistaken her for a prostitute. When she realized that wasn’t what he was after, she asked him what he wanted. He replied that he needed help rolling a joint and held up his hand to show two fingers missing. Sensing his distress, she agreed and followed him to his car, which happened to be located around a dark, back corner.
Deb ended up rolling four joints for Jason, and as he began to smoke one, they began talking. In the course of probably an hour, he shared how he had struggled with homosexuality his whole life, had never told anybody, and how alone and isolated he felt as a result. Of all the people for him to share with, he meets Deb, who specializes in ministry to (and who genuinely loves) homosexual people!</p>
<p>As they talked about the love and grace of Jesus, Jason began to weep. He was so thankful for Deb’s time and heart that he tried to give Deb a thick wad of cash—which was graciously declined. God brought Jason and Deb together in that strange situation. In some weird way, Deb met with God as much as Jason did.</p>
<p>All disciples, regardless of our stories, are called in some way to practice prevenience—to somehow discern the traces and activity of God in people’s lives and so join in the missio Dei (the mission of God), God’s grand redemptive activity in his world. God is already doing this, and we can join him in the strange places of our cities. If we are not willing to follow our missionary God into such places, people on the edges of the church will likely never get to hear the gospel.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God (God’s active rule and activity) is not limited just to the church, but extends over the entire cosmos; we, being commissioned agents of the King, can join with God in the redemption of the world, anywhere, anytime.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Practice of Passion</li>
</ol>
<p>The great symbol of the Protestant church is the cross, and rightly so, as it is a representation and reminder of where and how our Lord died on behalf of a lost humanity. But, in case you hadn’t noticed, the cross is empty. This symbolizes for Protestants the reality of the resurrection of Jesus, without going out, going deep which, as Paul says, we may as well all pack up and go home!</p>
<p>(1 Cor. 15:1–32).</p>
<p>The truth of the resurrection and all that it signifies in the life of the believer is not to be taken lightly in any sense.</p>
<p>We want to affirm not only that Jesus did indeed rise from the dead, but also the significance of his resurrection in the life and liberation of the individual believer and the church as a whole.</p>
<p>We also suggest, however, in line with our Catholic brothers and sisters, that the empty cross fails to represent the full story—we also need to embrace the image of the crucified God. In the crucifix, we are confronted with an image of the suffering Christ in all its forcefulness and brutality. While the act of the crucifixion was a one-time historical event summed up in Jesus’s very own words (“It is finished”), Jesus still continues to suffer every day for you, for me, and for a lost humanity.7 To over emphasize the resurrection without the balance of the crucifixion is to fail to comprehend the full picture of the death of Christ. This very thing caused Mel Gibson to portray the death of Jesus so vividly in his disturbingly graphic film The Passion of the Christ.</p>
<p>How can one make sense of Paul’s words in Colossians without an understanding of the sufferings of Christ for the life and mission of the individual Christian? Paul is very clear in saying that not only is it a privilege to suffer on behalf of the gospel, but that he makes up in his own body what was lacking in the sufferings of Christ (2 Cor. 1:4, 6, 8; 2:4; 6:4; 7:4; 8:2; Phil. 1:7). He says, “Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church” (Col. 1:24).</p>
<p>While most commentators are not really certain what Paul is saying, we do know he’s not suggesting in any way that what happened on the cross was incomplete or lacking. But in light of Paul’s constant references in other passages to the church’s “mystical union” with Christ (Rom. 6:3–11; 2 Cor. the untamed mission 4:10–14; Phil. 3:10), perhaps what he is suggesting here is that suffering will continue to be born by God’s people. T</p>
<p>In our experience, of both discipleship and mission, this makes a lot of sense. The fact is that humans suffer, and Christians who take seriously the lost and broken in our world will also suffer. This is the cost of discipleship; we are called to pick up our cross and follow Jesus (Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23). Implicit in the cross is suffering. In fact, Jesus clearly states that anyone who fails to pick up and carry the cross cannot be his disciple (Luke 14:72).</p>
<p>This has significant implications for discipleship and mission. As disciples we need to ensure we have incorporated a theology of redemptive suffering into our understanding of God, for this helps make sense of what we ourselves, or others, may experience. We also need to cultivate a sense of empathy or compassion for the other. This, in our minds, squares with how Jesus responded to others. He not only identified by experiencing the limitation that humanity brought, but he extended himself to feel what the other was feeling.
Identification on the level of the heart implies a certain intimacy with the people you are trying to reach. I dentification, as we’ve said before, is understanding their stories, their heroes, their books, their take on things. To incarnate on the level of the heart means we begin to feel their stories, their lives, their pains. Our hearts and compassion, are thereby activated.</p>
<p>If we are called to a particular people group or subculture, we need to understand the angst and pain the group may carry.</p>
<p>A good example here is the Jewish community. It would be very hard indeed to launch a ministry to Jewish people without a basic knowledge of the Holocaust and a fairly solid appregoing out, going deep Walking a mile in someone else’s glasses. ciation of the pain that informs and motivates. The GLBT community is another case in point; it will be hard to understand where they are coming from both socially and politically without knowing something of their personal and collective stories and the pain and marginalization they have experienced from the broader society—particularly the church.</p>
<p>Incarnation of the heart can be costly, so we often avoid it. However, it is too easy for us to just engage our minds or even bodies for the cause and sake of the gospel. Engaging the heart completes the picture. Jesus didn’t fulfill his mission on earth through mere forced obedience to the Father’s wishes; his heart was engaged, and he was moved with compassion to act on behalf of a lost humanity.</p>
<p>Maybe we are a tad weird, but whenever we visit a city we try to walk the red-light district. We recently did this in Amsterdam, and we took some people with us. Many of them were missionaries to that city but had never visited this important, if not very dark, aspect of that city’s culture.</p>
<p>Surely, loving a city requires that we feel its pain. The pain of the city can be a thermometer that connects us with the heart of God. To walk around and sense the lostness, despair, and longing can be difficult, but it is necessary if we are to make connections between God and the community.</p>
<p>Jesus puts himself in our situations because he loves us.</p>
<p>“The people who sit in some black hole need no longer look upward to where a crack admits light and fresh air. They need only look down to the bottom of their abyss. There is Christ; the untamed mission there where the border runs between despair and disintegration. Therefore we can trust Him. And therefore it is no empty phrase that He is there for us and that He is our brother.”8</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Practice of Proclamation</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus came to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God (Mark 1:14), and there is no question that we are called to the same task (2 Tim. 4:2). Aside from how we have individualized the proclamation—making it about personal salvation and narrowing the meaning of the gospel in the process—we have generally been quite good at this aspect of incarnational ministry. There is no doubt that the follower of Jesus must be both willing and able to share in the ministry of evangelism.</p>
<p>We are, in the end, messengers: it is an essential part of our purpose in the world to deliver the message. But we must do it in ways that are entirely consistent with the message; otherwise our lives will discredit the very message we seek to deliver. This is where personal witness and evangelism must be yoked together. Jesus is the Word. His life and teaching are one and the same. He is his own message—he is the good news.
Following the logic of the incarnation itself, our message is heard properly only when we have gone through the process of identifying with people, hearing them, understanding the issues they face, humbly living with them, and knowing how they experience and express their search for meaning. If we do this, we will have earned the right to address the hearts of the people and bring salvation to them. If we don’t do this, we will simply impose a cultural Christianity on them, and they could well end up in a worse situation than before (Luke 11: 24). This is what the Pharisees were guilty of in doing (Matt.</p>
<p>23:13, 15), and what we should be very wary of in our own going out, going deep lives as we seek to evangelize the lives of others. We therefore think that proclamation follows best after practicing the preceding “P’s” of an incarnational lifestyle.</p>
<p>This is why discipleship plays such a crucial part in evangelism. Because discipleship is the process of increasingly becoming like Jesus, our lives will serve to legitimize what we say. Because we are appealing to people’s deepest concerns, their existential issues known only to themselves and God, we stand on sacred ground; we must come into the relationship with personal integrity. When someone is not striving to be like his or her Lord and yet is calling others to give their lives over to God, it gives a very mixed message. It can even miscommunicate what God wants to do with people.</p>
<p>Now, we are not saying that we should be perfect before we can share the gospel, but surely we should be on the journey of being transformed ourselves before we call others to this arduous task. We do well to remember that evangelism is witness. Daniel T. Niles sums this up beautifully when he says the disciple “does not offer out of his own bounty. He has no bounty. He is simply a guest at his master’s table, and, as evangelist, he calls others too.”9 We believe that engaging our world incarnationally is not an option. If we genuinely seek to be like Jesus, then incarnational discipleship and mission should be the norm. It is the way God has chosen to reach the world in Jesus. It will require that we patiently love a person, a community, even a whole culture, to the point that we spend ourselves on being little Jesuses to that community. Not only is the credibility of the people of God linked to incarnational expression, but the credibility of the gospel is at stake in it as well.
The centrality of the community to the gospel means that the message is never disembodied. The word must always become flesh, embodied in the life of the called community.</p>
<p>The gospel cannot be captured adequately in propositions, the untamed mission or creeds, or theological systems, as crucial as all of these exercises are. The gospel dwells in and shapes the people who are called to be its witness. The message is inextricably linked with its messengers.10</p>
<p>Whatever our circumstance or context, understanding the implications of the incarnation and seeking to live them out will only make our lives more authentic, our love more tangible, and our light amidst the darkness shine more brightly.</p>
<h2>Suggested Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Humanizing God, divinizing humanity: Try to regularly</li>
</ul>
<p>factor the incarnation into your thinking. Not only does Jesus show us what God is like, but he also shows us a way to be truly human. It is therefore essential that we take seriously the doctrine of the incarnation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with fear and laziness: According to M. Scott Peck,</li>
</ul>
<p>these two vices lay at the very heart of sin. Fear will keep us from practicing presence and proximity with non-Christian people, and laziness will keep us from regularly being in their world. Yet we need to draw near and be there in their world to communicate the love of God incarnationally.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice prevenience: Trust the fact that God is already</li>
</ul>
<p>in any situation long before you arrive on the scene, and that if you have your eyes open, you can both see what he is doing and join with him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be intentional: It is critical that we develop habits and</li>
</ul>
<p>practices that inculcate the incarnational impulse. We have to be very intentional about it because the current church default tends to negate this impulse.
