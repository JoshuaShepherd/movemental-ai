<h1>The First Word</h1>
<h2>(Introduction)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The disciple must face the world fully aware of the desire of the Darkness to pervert and destroy the witness of the Light.</p>
<p>—Gene Davenport</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To believe means to be so rooted in Christ that he becomes the foundation of one's existence, the beginning and end of the movement known as life, its measure and source and strength. The extent to which we succeed depends on our loyalty and on our power of sacrifice. Hence the believer does well to say not that he is a Christian, but that he is becoming one.</p>
<p>—Romano Guardini</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the disciple of Jesus the stage of discipleship is not the first step towards a promising career. It is in itself the fulfillment of his destiny.</p>
<p>—David Bosch</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One day long ago, over the hot sands of a Middle Eastern country, a white skylark flew in joyous loops about the sky. As she swooped near the earth, she heard a merchant calling, "Come here, my little friend. Come! See the lovely worms I have!" The skylark circled about the merchant, hungry at the sight. Little did the skylark know that the merchant was the devil in disguise. He motioned her nearer. "Come here, my little friend. Come! See the lovely worms I have!" Cautiously, the skylark landed and cocked her head to the merchant. "Come! Taste the juicy worms!" The skylark became aware that she was, indeed, quite hungry. And these worms looked bigger and tastier than any she had ever dug for herself out of the hardscrabble ground of the desert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The skylark hopped closer and put her beak up close to the worm. “Two worms for a feather, my friend. Two worms for merely one!” The skylark was unable to resist. And she had, after all, so many feathers. So, with a swift motion she pulled out a feather—just a small one—from beneath her wing and gave it to the merchant. “Take your pick, my little friend... any two, your heart’s desire!” The skylark quickly snatched up two of the plumpest worms and swallowed her meal with delight.
With a loud chirp, she leapt into the air and resumed her joyful flight.</p>
<p>Day after day the skylark returned. And always the merchant had wonderful worms to offer: black ones and blue ones, red ones and green ones, all fat and shiny and iridescent.</p>
<p>But one day, after eating her fill, the skylark leapt again into the air—and to her horror, she fell to the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>She was unable to fly!</p>
<p>All at once with a shock she realized what had happened.</p>
<p>From eating the delicious worms she had grown fatter and fatter; and she had plucked her feathers one by one, first her body, then her tail, and finally her very wings had grown balder and balder. Horrified, she remembered how, slowly, imperceptibly, day by day, it had been getting harder and harder to fly, and how she had told herself it was no matter.</p>
<p>She could always stop before it was too late. Now suddenly here she was, trapped on the ground. She looked up and saw the merchant looking at her. Was that a small, sly grin spreading across his face? He grabbed the now helpless bird, put her in a cage, and walked away laughing.^1</p>
<h2>The Cage of a Thousand Compromises</h2>
<p>We start with this parable because, like all bargains with the devil, it mirrors so many processes that make up human life and, for the purposes of this book, the nature of the Christian walk gone wrong. Tragically, like the formerly wild skylark, little by little we give up our freedoms in Christ, only to end up in a cage made of a thousand little compromises. This of course need not be so. When we try to take shortcuts to costly discipleship, we end up with a domesticated existence that is far from the liberated, untamed life Jesus calls us to. Much of what we write here is about exposing some of the personal and cultural issues, and the idolatry so often associated with them, that in the end undermine our capacity to experience full, Christlike lives. If some of what is set forth in these pages seems strange to us, then it might well be because we have become too domesticated, accustomed to being featherless, and have now lost the art of flight. Perhaps it is because we have forgotten what it really means to follow the untamed, revolutionary Jesus. We must now remember in order to reactivate the journey.</p>
<p>In your hands is a book on what we call “missional discipleship.” In many ways it contains ideas and a call to live a lifestyle that should be normative for Jesus’s people. But we know all too well from personal experience and observation that following Jesus doesn’t always come easy. And being involved in various expressions of missional Christianity has given us an appreciation for just how hard it is to be consistent followers of our Lord and Savior. To be a truly radical disciple does require a relentless evaluation of life’s priorities and concerns, together with an ongoing, rigorous critique of our culture, to ensure we are not adopting values that subvert the very life and message we are called to live out.</p>
<p>We sincerely believe discipleship has become a frontier issue for the people of God at this time in history. In C. S. Lewis's words, "Indeed, the safest road to Hell is the gradual one—the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts."^2 North America is a vestige of the original [Christian] movement, an institutional expression of religion that is in part a civil religion and in part a club where religious people can hang out with other people whose politics, worldview, and lifestyle match theirs.^3 If this is indeed the case, we should be clear this is not what the church is called to be, and is, in fact, a failure in discipleship. And it must be addressed if we are to give faithful witness to our century. Therefore, rediscovering what it means to radically follow Jesus is an area of strategic, missional concern. The gospel is the power of God for the salvation of the world (Rom. 1:16), and God wants to redeem the broken and lost world around us. He has chosen to do this through us. Our lives, individual and corporate, play a vital role in the unfolding of the grand purposes of God. More is at stake in discipleship than our own personal salvation. The gospel cannot be limited to being about my personal healing and wholeness, but rather extends in and through my salvation to the salvation of the world. To fail in discipleship and disciple making is therefore to fail in the primary mission (or "sent-ness") of the church. And it does not take a genius to realize that we have all but lost the art of disciple making in the contemporary Western church.</p>
<h2>The Structure of Untamed</h2>
<p>We have divided the book into four sections. Following our approach of removing impediments to discipleship, we have identified three areas where problems in discipleship locate themselves: theology, culture, and personal issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: Untaming (Our Idea of) God</li>
</ul>
<p>The church has always believed that our most fundamental problems in discipleship have their roots in faulty views of God. If not properly addressed, these distorted views deeply impact our effectiveness as disciples and missionaries in our world. The first section therefore will look at some foundational theological issues related to our understanding of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Although we have tried to write this in a very accessible manner, some readers might find this section somewhat abstract and feel impatient to get to the "practical" issues. But nothing is more important than a right perception and experience of God. So, our advice is to slow down, and seriously examine your heart and engage your mind here. In probing issues relating to God, it is hard to avoid dealing with concepts in one form or another.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Two: Untaming Our Culture</li>
</ul>
<p>Culture is the context we all swim in. We can't help but be deeply informed by it at every level of our human life—individual as well as social. Culture is a complex jungle of ideas, history, language, religious views, economic systems, political issues, and the like. Culture forms the basic way in which human beings communicate and share life and meaning together. But not all of it fits nicely with reality as God defines it. The problem is that most of us are unaware of these issues because we simply assume that our culture is right. If we are not careful, then, the culture rather than God actually gets to define reality.</p>
<p>This section will explore the power of money and status, our understanding of the family, and (yes) the church. We put issues of church here because the church, as a human agency, must always express faith culturally. But it is often more conditioned by culture than it is by the gospel. For instance, how does the culture of consumerism affect our experience of the church? Is the church challenging society here, or are we being co-opted to a larger cultural agenda?</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Three: Untaming the Self</li>
</ul>
<p>On a more distinctly personal level, there are numerous obstacles to discipleship that are part of our own scripting (or software) as individuals. While theology and culture do impact us personally, the issues explored here are felt within our own psyches. How we understand who we are (self-image) and how we understand sexuality has everything to do with how we follow Jesus and engage the world. We cannot avoid these issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section Four: Untaming the Mission</li>
</ul>
<p>As people captivated by the incarnation, we couldn't finish the book without suggesting some practical ways of implementing untamed discipleship based on the life of Jesus. And so the final chapter is exactly that: a simple guide to incarnational mission. This chapter, based on six principles of incarnational living, includes a number of examples of individuals and communities doing just that in their local contexts. Nothing too heady, just some simple clues to going deep into culture based on the life and example of Jesus.</p>
<h2>Practices and Group Discussions</h2>
<p>At the end of every chapter is a set of practices along with some questions for group discussion. The practices are designed to be suggestions the reader can adopt in order to activate a more untamed version of following Jesus. By applying them you can act your way into a new way of thinking. As for the group discussion, we really do believe that community is the best context for discipleship and the right place for accountability and the pursuit of truth. Don't do this alone.</p>
<h2>Signature Themes</h2>
<p>If the book is structured around theology, culture, psychology, and mission (in that order), the reader will also discern that consistent themes pervade the entire book. Each chapter is spiced with four distinctive motifs or themes that, taken together, will create a certain vibe, or atmosphere, in the book.</p>
<p>They are...</p>
<h2>Jesus-shaped discipleship</h2>
<p>It seems crazy to say it, but the first thing we can say about missional discipleship is that it must take Jesus with utmost seriousness. Whatever place "Yahweh is Lord" had/has for Israel, "Jesus is Lord" has for us as disciples. Every single aspect of the way we live out our lives needs to be re-aligned around the person of Jesus and his lordship. A dynamic, vital, living reality and response to Jesus in every moment of our lives is our most fundamental truth, and we have forgotten it to our great peril.</p>
<p>N. T. Wright notably states that the longer you look at Jesus, the more you will want to serve him—that is, of course, if it is the real Jesus you are looking at.4 Because Jesus defines our concepts of God, getting it wrong here means getting it wrong everywhere (as we shall see in chapters 1 and 2). And because Jesus defines and models for us a perfected humanity, he shows us the way of true holiness.</p>
<h2>Shema spirituality</h2>
<p>The Shema (Deut. 6:4–9) is considered the most important confession in the Old Testament and in Judaism, and is confessed three times a day by every orthodox Jew. The word shema itself stems from the first word of this text and simply means “listen!” or “take heed.” “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” But its defining influence extends through the New Testament to each one of us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'H ear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'L ove your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus explicitly places the Shema at the epicenter of what it means to be a true disciple—to love God, to love others, and to live this out authentically in God's world. We believe that we must simply take Jesus at face value here; he is saying that "Shema spirituality" is core to the outworking of our discipleship—our life under God. Actually, when we look into this, there are thoroughly good reasons for it. We suggest that Shema spirituality helps us do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rediscover the true nature of worship (we must love one God, not many—no idols and images, please)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn what it means to love God in and through the whole of life (with intellect, passion, family, culture, money, sexuality, and so on)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand our relationship to the world and our obligation to "the other" (we can never come to a true discipleship in isolation from the love of people)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recover an authentically monotheistic worldview, out of which we can rightly interpret our world (operating with a unified worldview around the kingship of God)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Loving the one true God with all that we are, and loving others as ourselves, is as simple as it is profound. We have discovered that this core truth can indeed provide the answer to the obstacles we encounter on the road. In its simple but profound summation of the law and prophets, we find something of an antidote to the various forms of deceptive thinking and living. We have, therefore, coined the phrase "Shema spirituality" and use it consistently throughout the book.</p>
<h2>No mission, no discipleship</h2>
<p>We take the missional agenda of the church with utmost seriousness. You simply cannot be a disciple without being a missionary—a sent one. For way too long discipleship has been limited to issues relating to our own personal morality and worked out in the context of the four walls of the church with its privatized religion. In doing this, we have severely neglected our biblical mandate to go and "make disciples." We have narrowed the gospel message to just being about us. To strive for holiness and maturity in our own personal lives is extremely important, but it is only half the picture; the other half is our God-given responsibility to the world around us. The fact is that you can't be a disciple without being a missionary: no mission, no discipleship. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>The mission we are all called into will, to varying degrees, involve an active engagement with the poor and the marginalized. The Scriptures are clear about this. One cannot read the Bible without being confronted with God's heart for outcasts of all varieties. While we have no specific chapter that deals explicitly with this, issues of justice and care for the poor will be found in many of the stories we share and are implied throughout the whole book. We are also conscious of the fact that many books have been written on this very subject, and we encourage the reader to explore them.</p>
<h2>Of prophets and idols</h2>
<p>We don’t believe what we are saying is in any sense new, but rather that it represents a contemporary restatement of the ancient, prophetic, call to faithfulness that has been a constant part of the church’s calling in every age. In many ways, the prophetic challenge to the church is part of the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in seeking to sanctify the people of God, and the world through them. The Nicene Creed rightly states that Christians believe that the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophets. We sometimes fall into thinking that the prophets were simply speaking into a past era, but the truth is that the same Spirit still speaks through the prophets and those called to extend their challenge in the life of God’s people. And because we as humans are prone to sin, safety, and self-concern, we need the prophetic ministry in order to be true to our calling. For a whole host of reasons, we all stray from our radical calling to change our world by working out the life of Christ in us (Phil. 2:12–13). In fact, at least a third of Scripture is dedicated to the ongoing integrity of God’s people. God’s people in every age need correction— ours no less.
So Here We Go...</p>
<p>Join with us now as we journey into issues of discipleship.</p>
<p>And please know that when addressing the issues we cover in this book, we do not do so dispassionately. We are deeply involved with this material. We struggle with every element on a daily basis, and our stories, which are woven throughout the text, are as yet incomplete. We, like you, have sold some of our feathers, and we yearn to retrieve them. We yearn to be more and more like Jesus because we believe the purpose of our lives can only be found in becoming eternally conformed to the image of God’s Son (Rom. 8:29). It must become something of a holy obsession!</p>
