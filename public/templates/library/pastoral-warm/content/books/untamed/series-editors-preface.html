<h1>Series Editor's Preface</h1>
<p>The Shapevine series seeks to highlight the missional significance of its various contributors; this book fits admirably in the purpose of the series. The fact that I am one of the authors of this particular work should not distract from the sheer strategic significance involved in the rediscovery of a vigorous and explicitly missional form of discipleship.</p>
<p>The fact that discipleship in the church is considered a somewhat lost art ought to disturb us profoundly. On the odd occasions we have actually have managed to engage in some form of discipleship, we have tended to limit it to issues of personal spirituality (prayer times, Bible study, God's leading, tithing, etc.) and not conceive of it as something that has direct ramifications beyond the individual's privatized religious sensibilities. But discipleship in the way of Jesus is surely much more comprehensive than that. That we have cultivated an attenuated form of "designer" discipleship, a do-it-yourself spirituality that has little to say beyond the confines of the Christian community itself, only highlights the need to recover something a whole lot more vigorous than we currently have. Again, this unnerves those of us concerned with the health and impact of Christianity in the twenty-first century because if we fail in this most fundamental of tasks, we must surely fail in whatever ministry that should build upon it. Discipleship—our capacity to lovingly embody and transmit the life of Jesus through the lives of his followers, is the internal "quality control" mechanism inherent in Christianity itself.</p>
<p>As Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned in the years leading up to the Second World War, a Christianity without discipleship is a Christianity without Christ. And a Christless Christianity is surely an abomination that is likely to do much damage to the world in which it appears. The rise of Nazism within Germany, even among German Christians, only proves his point.</p>
<p>We do well to heed the lessons of history in this regard.</p>
<p>This might be the first book in the series that will focus on recovering the loving art of a rigorous, missional discipleship, but it won’t be the last.</p>
