<h1>Why Write This Book?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>We have both walked with Jesus for many years now and know personally just how difficult the path of missional discipleship can be. Following Jesus has a very clear cost. And serious believers who want to go deep must critique both personal and cultural assumptions for the sake of authentic discipleship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply stated, we write to help disciples of Jesus become better and deeper disciples. In order to do this, we have selected from both our personal and ministry experience a number of "obstacles" that, more than others, seem to trip up the people of God. It is these that we write about.</p>
<p>In the course of writing this book, we celebrated our twentieth wedding anniversary and our twentieth year of being in "official" ministry, for we started pastoral ministry four days after we were married. In fact we were so keen to get started that we cut our honeymoon short to move into the pastor's house next door to the church where we were to be the ministers—not something we would now recommend! For us, serving God has always been a partnership. And we see ourselves and our ministries as richer for the different perspectives and passions we each bring. No doubt you will feel something of these passions as you read through the text and some of the stories we've included. In light of this, and in case you'd like to know a little more about us, we thought we'd share something of our story and some of those passions with you.</p>
<h2>Deb’s Passion</h2>
<p>For as long as I (Deb) can remember, I have identified with the “other,” those that have been deemed different or “outsiders,” those society has generally struggled to accept. Most of my early memories involve my sister (Sharon) and my cousin (Mark), neither of whom quite fit the norm. My sister was born with a physical disability, and my cousin had a distinctly “effeminate” nature; neither were really acceptable in the rough, working-class area we grew up in. At our school, being different or standing out in any way ensured you were the object of ridicule, or even abuse. I can still remember the fights I would get into defending and protecting them from constant bullying.</p>
<p>No doubt these experiences were to lay a foundation within me of deep sensitivity to issues of marginalization and injustice, a theme that continues to run through my life.</p>
<p>I found Jesus (or rather, he found me) many years later along with that same sister and cousin. We were in our early twenties, living reckless lives of drugs, sex, and partying. We were active members of the GLBT1 community and proudly identified ourselves as "gay." We were seekers, but didn't realize just how lost we were until one of our friends (and drug dealer) became a Christian and shared the message of the gospel with us. In Jesus we found not only great relief from the existential angst we carried, but experienced deep liberation for our souls.</p>
<p>Part of this "seeing" for me was a realization that my sensitivity for the "other" was actually a gift from God. God loves the outcast, those society has for whatever reason pushed to the edges. Here my passion met with God's heart. I cannot read the Scriptures without seeing the truth of this. It is to "the least of these," in whatever shape or form—whether transsexual, gay, prostitute, or poor—that I believe I am called, in order that somehow they can come to know that same amazing, transforming grace I experienced all those years ago.</p>
<h2>Al’s Passion</h2>
<p>I (Alan) grew up in a Jewish family and was born and raised in apartheid South Africa until age twenty-two. Having a seemingly natural affinity with black people, I became politically active against apartheid as early as age thirteen. Nothing too hotheaded, but I had already decided that apartheid was profoundly wrong and morally reprehensible. After spending a mandatory two-year stint in the military, where I was first introduced to drugs and then to Jesus, I attended university in Cape Town. I then eventually immigrated to Australia with my family in 1983, shortly after I met my wonderful wife and partner.</p>
<p>Although I was not an observant Jew by any stretch of the imagination, I can honestly say I don’t remember a time when I ever doubted God’s existence, and I can remember moments of ecstatic worship, even as a very young boy, where God seemed more real to me than my own self. My journey to explicit Christian faith started early, with what seemed to a young Jewish teenager as an illicit fascination with Jesus. As far as I can recall, I had never met a real Christian until I was about twenty, when one of my drug buddies was born again and began to share the gospel with me. For me, coming to Jesus was coming home in every way. I had an overwhelming encounter with God and was totally and absolutely won over.</p>
<p>It was the defining moment of my life: I gave my life fully to Jesus and I have never looked back.</p>
<p>As for my passion and my reasons for writing this text, it is important for the reader to know that this book is set within the context of this great love affair that I have with God's people. I really believe in the church: when it is true to its identity and purpose, it is far and away the most transformative force for good in society. It must be, because when it is faithful, it is the most concentrated expression of the liberating kingdom of God.</p>
<p>My calling, and my passion, is to reawaken the missional capacities of the church in the West. In The Shaping of Things to Come, and especially in The Forgotten Ways, I have attempted to set forth this positive, transformative, and distinctly apostolic vision of the church as a Jesus movement. If this book seems somewhat more critical (dare I say prophetic) in tone, then it must be understood that it is set within the broader context of an apostolic (a missionary perspective and drive) vision for the church as a missional movement that can, and will, change the world. I believe that this is exactly the form of the church that can reestablish the vitality of Christianity in the West. But through my own struggles and other forms of personal experience and observation, I have come to believe we are never going to be the movement Jesus wants unless we first get the issues of discipleship right.</p>
<p>No disciples, no movement—it's that simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Going South: Submerging into Our City</p>
</blockquote>
<p>South Melbourne Restoration Community, the church where we began our first "official" ministry (affectionately called South), was located in an inner-city context and made up largely of people who, in one way or another, were on the fringes of society. From the homosexual to the prostitute, the schizophrenic to the drug addict, our community was full of people who didn't quite fit the norm. And even though there were some "normal" people (thank God), this was no regular church. Many said of us that we were the first port of call for those on their way into the church and the last port of call for those on their way out. If they couldn't make it with us, they weren't going to make it anywhere!</p>
<p>We led this wonderful community for fifteen years. We lived, loved, cried, and laughed with this bunch of people; and they, more than most, helped define who we are as people.</p>
<p>This collection of “freaks” became our family, one little microcosm of the greater family of God. We learned so much throughout these years, and, as is often the case, much more through our mistakes—and they were many!</p>
<h2>Forging New Paths</h2>
<p>Throughout our time at South, we were privileged to be able to plant other communities of faith, and help in initiating various outreach agencies and missional orders. On top of this, Al was also involved in leadership of our denomination and Deb led a ministry to gays, lesbians, and transsexuals, and also served the poor through her work with the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Our passion to see others come to know Jesus has always been a constant throughout our ministry. The outworking of this passion, among other things, was pioneering Forge Mission Training Network, an agency devoted to developing missional leaders for incarnational forms of mission in Western cultural contexts. Forge now has networks in Australia, Canada, and the USA, with the possibility of a European one in the future. One of our great joys has been to see Forge become a significant grassroots movement God has used to influence the way the church both sees itself and responds to its context.</p>
<p>We say this here not from any notion of personal achievement, rather because we have a great sense of having been why write this book? graced to be able to experience firsthand what missional church in the untamed way of Jesus can be. But we can say this: looking back on our various experiences, particularly our many failures, most could, at root, be traced back to failures in discipleship. If discipleship involves our life in Christ and his life in and through us, then we think that many problems can be traced to breakdowns in this connection.</p>
<p>For whatever reasons (and we now have a few clues about this) Jesus’s “software” was not properly downloaded into our lives. This applies to issues from deformed Christian identity to narrow understandings of the family, and everything in between. If we failed at mission, it was because we failed to ground a sense of obligation to Jesus’s lordship in everything we did. If we failed in generosity, it was because we hadn’t rooted out the love of money and status that forms the basis of our consumerist culture. Likewise, if we failed in areas of personal morality and social responsibility, it was because we didn’t pay enough attention to what it means to walk in the radical way of Jesus.</p>
<p>We believe our own experience only mirrors the experience of so many in the Western church: these various issues present significant cultural and theological fault lines in Western expressions of Christianity, and given the strategically significant situation of the church in the West, we must find a way to once again become the robust, untamed, transformative movement God has designed the church to be.</p>
<p>In writing this book, we not only hope to identify some of these flaws in our scripting, but also to provide some lively clues as to how we may, in the power of the Spirit, overcome them. And we write not as judges (God forbid), but rather as fellow travelers personally committed to increasingly becoming the untamed people we are called to be. We do believe that whatever direction you or I should take, we should somehow be taking it with Jesus. And so it is our deep hope that we can, with you, authentically live out the radical, grace-saturated life of Jesus and become more like the One we love.</p>
