<h1>Chapter 2: Your God Is Too Sick</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If your conception of God is radically false, then the more devout you are, the worse it will be for you. You are opening your soul to be molded by something else. You had much better be an atheist.</p>
<p>—William Temple</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a man does not love the Lord with all his mind, he does not thereby become pure reason with no loves; he simply loves something else with all his heart, soul, strength and mind.</p>
<p>One's loves are always deeper than his reason; and reason is always in the employment of some love.</p>
<p>—Paul Ramsay</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important aspect of faith is our mental picture of God.</p>
<p>—Greg Boyd</p>

<p>Recently we couldn't make it to our community worship, so we decided to go to TV church instead. Quite honestly, we wish we hadn't. We ended up thoroughly disturbed by the sheer garbage the TV preacher was dishing out. But there we were, transfixed and horrified at the distortions being foisted upon the doting audience. We became part of a massive, translocal audience of viewers who, for whatever reason, were not part of a local church, subjecting ourselves to dangerous religious twaddle.
One thing that has always perplexed us is how so many of us can be so taken in by people who parrot back to us simply what we want to hear, and then somehow still manage to call it Christianity. Paul calls this having “itching ears” (2 Tim.</p>
<p>4:3), and if it didn’t have such tragic consequences, it would be really funny. We do actually know people who watch this stuff for its sheer comedic value! But trawling through the “God channels” ought to be an experience that unnerves any disciple of Jesus. How can so many sincere folk be so fooled by people who appear, to us at least, to be obvious charlatans? There can be no question of the sincerity and zeal with which both the deceived and the deceivers adhere to their beliefs. But the bond between them seems to lie in their common desire for the same thing. Cults, of course, are built on the same phenomenon.
We should never be fooled by mere sincerity: it has never been a particularly good test for truth—as is clearly seen in your god is too sick the case of our TV “evangelists.” False prophecy has always plagued spirituality because, as Martin Buber rightly notes, in most cases false prophets are not godless. Rather, they adore the god “success.” They themselves are in constant need of success and achieve it by promising it to the people. But they do honestly want success for the people. T</p>
<p>That is what Jeremiah called the “deceit of their own hearts.” They do not deceive; they are deceived, and can only breathe in the air of deceit.1 We begin this chapter with this rather disconcerting reflection on the nature of false prophecy and deception because it provides us with the right platform to be able to explore how apparently earnest religious people can get it so wrong.</p>
<p>This in turn allows us to raise questions of how we can keep ourselves in the way of Jesus and not fall prey to similarly deceptive impulses in our own hearts and those of other apparently sincere people. To do this we have to explore issues relating to the right knowledge of God.</p>
<p>Abook on missional discipleship must first get the basics right in relation to God. If we get the fundamental notions of God wrong, it will negatively impact our personal discipleship and damage the very people we are trying to reach, as we saw in the previous chapter with Homer and “Jeebus.” The truth is that all of us entertain false notions of God to some degree. None of us gets all of it right—even the most insightful. But if we get it fundamentally wrong and then get passionate about the untruth we have come to believe, then all hell breaks loose—literally! History amply bears out the truth that we Christians are dangerous people when we are wrong.</p>
<h2>Idolatry: The Rebel's Religion</h2>
<p>If God is not the defining center of our faith, life, and identity, then who or what is? This is a question that should disturb each and every one of us. This is particularly true considering the fact that we are compulsive idolaters and rebels who, rather than take our cues from a God who demands our all, seek to fit reality into something far more convenient and selfreferential. In the Bible, to refuse God’s definition of reality and subsequently construct our own is called idolatry—and it is the religion of the rebel who renounces the kingdom for the more cozy alternatives. C. S. Lewis says it in his characteristically brilliant way: What Satan put into the heads of our remote ancestors was the idea that they could “be like gods,” that they could set up on their own as if they had created themselves—be their own masters—invent some sort of happiness for themselves outside God, apart from God. And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human history—money, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slavery—the long terrible story of men trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.2 This is exactly why the Bible is so consistent in its condemnation of idolatry and the creation of images of God—be they physical or conceptual. William Temple notes that “it is as much idolatry to worship a false mental image as by means of a false metal image. The mental image misrepresents God and has the same disastrous effects on character.” And he concludes with this pithy comment, “If your conception of God is radically false, then the more devout you are, the worse it will be for you. You are opening your soul to be molded by something else. You had much better be an atheist.”3 We easily lose focus on what is essential. We miss the fact that discipleship has to do with becoming like Jesus, living the Shema, and not forgetting that the “more important matters your god is too sick...
23:23–24), are nonnegotiables in the equation.</p>
<p>As hard-line religious fundamentalists (the contemporary Pharisees?) amply illustrate, simply replacing these central aspects of discipleship with a whole lot of religious zeal does not make up for getting the basics wrong. In fact, zeal without proper understanding of God can actually result in sincerely opposing what God represents, and all in the name of God. Consider what Paul has to say about the Pharisees of his day: Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</p>
<p>Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. (Rom. 10:1–3, italics ours) The truth is that religious zeal is not necessarily a sign of trust in and commitment to God; in fact it may betray a deep doubt and an insecurity that depends on self rather than on God, and on the belief that whatever is lacking in God’s grace must be compensated for by one’s own virtue.</p>
<p>Religion can either make us good or very, very bad. As C. S. Lewis explains, religion opens us to new possibilities of both good and evil. From that point on the road branches: one way leads to sanctity, humility, the other to spiritual pride, self-righteousness, and persecuting zeal. There is simply no way back to the mere humdrum virtues of the unawakened soul. If the Divine does not make us better, it will make us very much worse. Of all the bad men, religious bad men are the worst.^4 (italics ours) This quote reminds us of a dangerous man we encountered in our early years of ministry. On the surface this man was attractive and charismatic, with an apparent love and respect for Jesus: he fed the poor and led Bible studies and did the things normally associated with godliness. However, over time a number of things began to alert us that something wasn't right about him. He began to consistently and subtly undermine the leadership team, particularly Al, who was the team leader at that time. Over the months he became more overt and started directly challenging the leadership. HHe was basically trying to take over leadership and split the community. We then discovered he was sleeping with several of the women in our church, including married women. He was also drawing people into his life and seriously messing with their heads. This was in many ways more serious than the illicit sex. He was creating a little cult. When confronted with these issues, his true colors really surfaced.</p>
<p>After many months of trying to negotiate with him, we were unable to reach any resolution. Eventually we had to ask him to leave, and even once had to have him physically removed from the church building by our local law enforcement. He responded to this by sitting outside our church every Sunday for six months with placards and accosting everyone who came along. He also tried to get the media involved. It really was an awful time for us. In the end we discovered, through some of his family members, that his dad was a cult leader in South America and had a history of splitting churches. This guy was following in his footsteps. Of course we were thrilled that he thought to try it on us! your god is too sick It is interesting that around that time, Deb was reading M. Scott Peck’s book People of the Lie, which powerfully describes the anatomy of evil. Peck suggests that it is a form of pathological narcissism that imbibes people and uses things, including theology, to draw people into its orbit. Peck says that real evil is deceptive because it looks more upright and attractive than what we might initially expect. T</p>
<p>We were dealing with one sick puppy.</p>
<p>The reality is that what we believe about God does have consequences. History is full of people who have wreaked enormous damage and even killed for what they believe in.</p>
<p>Historian George Weigel rightly notes,</p>
<p>How men and women think about God—or don’t think about God—has a great deal to do with how they envision a just society and how they determine the appropriate means by which to build that society. This means taking theology seriously—which includes taking seriously other’s concepts of God’s nature and purposes, and the commitments to the beliefs arising from these concepts.5 He explains how theology is worked out within the context of the radical I slamist threat. At its core, the jihadist idea of God is a sick one. “The power of jihadism, and the distinctive character of the threat it poses, derives from its theological roots.” And the key theological idea that underwrites today’s jihadist ideology and practice is the identification of God as Absolute Will.6 When God is viewed in this way, there can be no pathos, no possibility of sacrificial love (agape) in the relation of God toward his creation. This deeply distorted understanding of the God of Abraham leads jihadists into grave error: for instance, mercy comes to be understood as weakness, and the concept of justice is reduced to sheer revenge—a process vividly on the untamed god display when terrorists, for example, set bombs off among innocent people. “These social malignancies can be traced back to one source, namely that of a defective understanding of God.”7 But before we are tempted to simply point out defects in I slam, let us remind ourselves that it was so-called European Christendom that produced the Crusades, the Inquisition, numerous genocides, and systematic anti-Semitism. It also kept slavery very much alive until a few brave followers of Jesus decided it was time to take it out over eighteen hundred years after Jesus arrived on the scene! H</p>
<p>We suggest that all these are generated by a sick and distorted view of God—certainly not the same God we find in the sacrificial life, teachings, and death of Jesus. It is utterly inconceivable to us how people can supposedly love Jesus and yet burn tens of thousands of people for not agreeing with some theological ideas or conforming to some bizarre ecclesial practice (as in the Inquisition)!</p>
<h2>One Love—Shema Spirituality</h2>
<p>In light of all this, how can we ensure we have a true understanding of God? Or even better, how can we know God? We believe Jesus is the answer and points us in the right direction when he says, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” [and] “Love your neighbor as yourself.” There is no commandment greater than these. (Mark 12:29–31)</p>
<p>The power of Shema spirituality, or what Scot Mc Knight creatively calls “the Jesus Creed,” sums up the central revelation of God in Scripture and provides us with a worldview in a sentence. In other words, it is not just a simple descripyour god is too sick tion of what true worship means (and it is that), but also a description of a disciple’s basic orientation to the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shema contains the revelation that God is one.</li>
<li>The Shema shows us that God wants to be loved and</li>
</ul>
<p>worshiped in every aspect of life and with all of our being. The clear implication is that nothing in life, culture, and the human experience lies outside of this all-encompassing claim. No false dualisms, no sacredsecular splits—all of our lives, including our sexuality, work, play, home, politics, and economics, can, and indeed must, become aspects of our worship to the One True God.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shema is expanded by Jesus to explicitly include</li>
</ul>
<p>the love of people, for it has always been a temptation of “religious” people to see religion as purely devotion toward God. Jesus will not allow this. Discipleship in the way of Jesus must include the love of people.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments show us this truth. The first three of the ten have to do with one God and the prohibition of idolatry. The fourth has to do with the sanctification of time, thereby safeguarding the God-relationship. The rest of the commandments move straight into what it means to live together without killing each other—straight into ethics, or lifestyle! No grand philosophies, no eloquent speeches... just holy living in the whole of life-under-God.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Western spiritual tradition has tended to limit discipleship to issues relating to our personal morality, thereby neglecting our missional involvement in the world.</p>
<p>But discipleship must include both and everything in between.</p>
<p>We would argue that if we truly understood Shema spirituality, we wouldn't even have to talk about mission because it is all contained in the primal confession—loving God and loving others as ourselves! To worship God involves loving God in all and every arena of life. Mission is implicit throughout the creed. And discipleship in the way of Jesus is all about living out the Shema. It is missional to the core! Hence, no mission, no discipleship.</p>
<p>The Shema as Jesus restates it provides the disciple with the best approach to a true biblical understanding of God. As we have noted in the Introduction, the Shema is the central, most important confession in the Bible. When Christians confess that “Jesus is Lord,” understood in the light of the Shema, we have together a distillation of monotheism, an ethos, and a worldview in a sentence.8</p>
<h2>The School of Love</h2>
<p>So what does it mean to love God? If we were to design a school or training program for loving God, what would it look like? We think such a school would have three areas of focus: right feeling, right acting, and right thinking. These three can be said to converge in a sweet spot called discipleship. Let’s unpack this a bit.9 Feelin’ all right...</p>
<p>In the biblical worldview, in order to truly know something (yada in Hebrew), one cannot merely observe it but come into right right thinking acting</p>
<h2>Discipleship:</h2>
<p>Biblical Way of Knowing right feeling your god is too sick contact with it. There must be mutuality and personal involvement. That’s why this word is used for knowledge of God and also for the act of sex. Leanne Payne makes the insightful point that “we come to know ultimate reality, not by theological ideas about it, even though these are valid and necessary, but by union with it—by the establishing of a personal relationship between God and man.”10 To know God this way requires a passionate concern and the application of one’s whole personality existentially. T</p>
<p>We can’t remain passive spectators of God but rather must be active participants with him. The Bible’s understanding of “the heart” is far bigger than how we usually understand it. It is not only the source of our emotions, as we tend to think, but also of our will, loyalty, and commitment.
I am bold in saying this, but I believe that no one is ever changed, either by doctrine, by hearing the word, or by the preaching or teaching of another, unless the religious affections are moved by these things.... In a word, there is never any great achievement by the things of religion without a heart deeply affected by those things.... True religion is placed in the affections.^14 Clearly, the heart is faith's truest home.</p>
<h2>Putting our bodies on the line</h2>
<p>The follower of Jesus broadens his or her knowledge of God through living truth, not just believing in it. True knowledge of God must be expressed in practice or action—that’s why the Bible is one-third ethics. Obedience— body and soul—is part of the condition of God’s covenant (for example, Exod. 24:7; Jer. 11:3) as well as the momentous parting words of commission under which we live (Matt. 28:18–20). As C. S. Lewis says, “Obedience is the ‘holy courtesy’ required for entering into the divine relationship.”15 In the Bible, the real test of what you know is how you live your faith. S</p>
<p>Think of Christians whom you admire, and you can be sure they are not simply devout people who got their theology or devotional lives right, but rather people who actually did something significant in their worlds. We think of St. Patrick, Martin Luther, John Wesley, William Booth, Corrie ten Boom, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Mother Teresa, Jackie Pullinger, as well as countless other known and anonymous saints who have made a difference in their own unique ways.</p>
<h2>Thinking thoughts after God</h2>
<p>With our hearts open to God, and a commitment to obey, it’s time to seriously engage God with our minds. I ntellectual laziness is simply not an option for disciples. This doesn’t mean that God expects all of us to be intellectual giants, but he does require that we love him with our minds. As the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley rightly said, “The mind becomes that which it contemplates.” This has both negative your god is too sick and positive consequences, for if we think about nothing, our minds become nothing. But if we think thoughts after God, we become more like him. Besides, for many it can be a pathetic and dangerous cop-out to just “feel” God in worship and prayer—this is necessary but not sufficient for a fully fledged Shema spirituality. T</p>
<h2>A Mature Community</h2>
<p>To be mature disciples, we need to engage with knowing and loving God on all three levels: our minds, our hearts, and our actions. And because we are all wired differently, we will tend to prefer one over the other, which is why real knowledge of God reached at in the context of the community of faith where people can learn from one another.</p>
<p>The activists learn from the theologians, who learn from the pastors, and so on. This way we can complement each other’s strengths and compensate for the more underdeveloped areas. The local and broader church community also provides for us a form of accountability, where we can measure our “knowledge of God” against historical witness as well as that of other brothers and sisters. We do not arrive at truth alone.</p>
<h2>Another One Bites the Dust</h2>
<p>Leading a community of faith for over fifteen years has not only been a great privilege and an incredibly enriching experience, but at times it has been a source of great anxiety and heartbreak. One of the sources of heartbreak is to look back and see how many have left the way of discipleship.</p>
<p>It's like The Pilgrim's Progress gone wrong—where way too many are not pilgrims and so they do not progress. Sadly, our experience has seemed to correlate more with the parable of the sower (Matt. 13:1–23), where only one in four remains faithful and becomes fruitful in the end! Many of these friends have redefined Christian discipleship to suit their respective lifestyles, or have reframed God in some way, or have simply ditched the faith altogether—and in so doing have sold their feathers for worms, only to have lost the capacity to fly.</p>
<p>Much of this book is an exposition of the inner dynamics of the parable of the sower, or, to return to our parable of the skylark, of why so many sell their feathers. People leave the path for reasons such as spiritual shallowness, status anxiety, pursuit of wealth, fear of persecution, or because of many other, sometimes even demonic, anti-discipleship forces that are at work in our world.</p>
<p>Dealing with the complex, sexually charged (often in a very broken way) community at South that emerged largely from fringy, non-Christian backgrounds has forced us to come to grips with the actual motives of why people choose to leave the path of following Jesus. We think we are given a vital clue in Ezekiel 14, where Ezekiel narrates the situation of some of the elders of Israel coming to him to get a prophecy. At this point he is given an insight into the nature of their inquiring.</p>
<p>God says to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and
put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let
them inquire of me at all? Therefore speak to them and tell
raelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling
will answer him myself in keeping with his great idolatry.”
In verse 7 he continues, “When any Israelite or any alien
your god is too sick
face and then goes to a [false] prophet to inquire of me, I the
is enticed to utter a prophecy, I the Lord have enticed that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that what is being said here is if someone is pre-committed to falsity and will not pursue God with pure heart and motives, they will hear only what they want to hear.</p>
<p>(We do well to remember that it is only the pure in heart that will see God [Matt. 5:8].) The horrifying result of impure motives is that people sincerely believe it is God who has spoken, when all along it was their own lying hearts! Isaiah agrees when he utters this chilling warning: Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.</p>
<p>But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. But this is what you shall receive from my hand: You will lie down in torment. (Isa.</p>
<p>50:10–11)</p>
<p>When we deliberately turn our hearts from the love of truth and redefine it to suit ourselves, we will experience the anguish of our choices. God's truth can be for me a guiding light, something that gives me direction, only if it has been revealed to me in my encounter with God—not if I have somehow selected it for myself from among many existing options. The heresy in this act is nothing other than the clinging to a particular thought or idea simply because it is one's own. And the result is, as Charles Williams wrote, "the disintegration of the intellect, the justification to oneself of error and evil."^17 In Romans, Paul draws directly on this prophetic understanding of idolatry in his sharp (and always current) exposé on the inner nature of unbelief. He reminds us that although all can discern God, they suppress this knowledge (and therefore their conscience) in order that they might engage in immorality (1:18). He ends up describing well the dark sides of twenty-firstrst-century culture. T</p>
<p>This “handing over” is what is The Hall of Mirrors meant in both Ezekiel’s as well “In normal circumstances people as Isaiah’s prophecies above. The who turn their backs on reality are judgment we receive is this: as soon set straight by the mockery we ignore God, we are handed and criticism of those around them, over to our sins, to ungodly rawhich makes them aware they have tionalizations, and ultimately to lost credibility. In the Third Reich self-deception.18 there were no such correctives, esWitness the profound depecially for those who belonged to ception of the Nazis in Albert the upper stratum. On the contrary, every self-deception was multiplied Speer’s testimony (see sideas in a hall of distorting mirrors, bar).19 It is because of the allbecoming a repeatedly confirmed too-human propensity for rapicture of a fantastical dream world tionalization and self-deception which no longer bore any relationthat we fail in discipleship. For ship to the grim outside world. In the disciple, God provides the those mirrors I could see nothing light (the truth) by which we but my own face reproduced many must walk. It requires real integtimes over.” rity (purity of heart) to stay true —The testimony of Albert Speer, to God and self in this way. The one of Hitler’s henchmen Christian community is called to walk in this light. Abiblical spirituality collapses when we refuse to walk in the light of the God revealed in Jesus, and thereby fail to have fellowship with one another (1 John 1:5–10).
Truth, and the disciple’s commitment to truth no matter what, plays a vital role in keeping us walking in the way of Jesus (2 Thess. 2:9–10). And to do this we must constantly, your god is too sick as well as comprehensively, repent of our idolatry! (See Ezek.</p>
<p>14:6; 1 Thess. 1:9.) Here are a few ways we idolatrously attempt to redefine God and confine discipleship.</p>
<h2>Theology of the little head</h2>
<p>We hope the reader will excuse the slightly risqué heading, but we believe this humorous little phrase captures the very point we want to make here. Again, this comes from tons of experience with sexually charged young adults of both the heterosexual and the homosexual variety.</p>
<p>We once heard Tony Campolo tell of a time when he was head of the department in a secular university. Being Tony Campolo, he was well-known as a follower of Jesus and became something of a mentor to many Christian students on the campus who would seek his advice on various issues they were facing. He tells a story of a young man he was mentoring who, after six months of being at the university, declared that he now had significant intellectual problems with his faith. As a result, he was undergoing a serious existential crisis. Tony wryly asked the question, "When did you start sleeping with your girlfriend?" The student, now somewhat taken aback, asked why this had anything to do with his deep existential crisis, but eventually confessed that he had started having sex with his girlfriend two months prior to this conversation. T</p>
<p>Psychology has a great name for this—it's called cognitive dissonance. It occurs when a person's beliefs, knowledge, and values clash with persuasive information that calls them into question. This inconsistency causes psychological discomfort, and the mind adjusts to reduce the discrepancy. In ethics, cognitive dissonance is important because of its ability to alter values.</p>
<p>This squares completely with our pastoral experience.</p>
<p>Almost every time someone comes to us saying that they suddenly have serious intellectual problems with God, the real issue is that they are having sex with someone—or want to and are working themselves up to it! They have begun thinking with the little head and not with their big head.</p>
<p>And the penis, as it has often been noted, is not known for its conscience! Although this metaphor is distinctly masculine, the exact same sexual motive lies behind the sins of many women who claim the same issues.</p>
<p>The reality is that disciples sometimes have to obey God simply because of the joy of doing God’s will—even, and perhaps especially, when this runs up against the dictates of our passions and desire. If we wish to preserve the life-giving connection with God, we must learn the discipline of obedience to God in a world that will reward us for waywardness. your god is too sick Our love of God, and hence our discipleship, is at stake in our choices, so we need to beware. We “do not fail in obedience through lack of love, but have lost love because [we] have not attempted obedience.”21</p>
<h2>Adishonest buck</h2>
<p>People can lose integrity and focus when it comes to money. One of the clearest religious examples of this is seen in the so-called prosperity doctrine. The great danger in this prosperity doctrine is that it is almost true.22 This is what makes it an even more insidious error, because there is enough truth in it to allow us to legitimize it with some “shonky” theology. But remember that deceived people are actually sincere in believing it is true. However, they believe it because it is precisely what they want to believe and because it tells them what their idolatry (in this case, mammon) requires them to believe. Think back to the passage in Ezekiel. The idol in their heart is money, they inquire of God with this idol firmly entrenched, God allows them to be deceived (according to their idolatry), they say, “Thus says the Lord,” and voilà, prosperity doctrine is born. But in order to rationalize their beliefs, the adherents of prosperity doctrine must dismiss much of the critique of wealth in the Bible—especially that of Jesus and Paul. Herein lies its error, and to some degree it is endemic throughout the church in the West, not just in Pentecostal-charismatic circles. We are all wealthy, and we all have to justify it—cognitive dissonance again. B</p>
<h2>Anot-so-flowery use of power</h2>
<p>One of the most dangerous rationalizations in Christian history involves false ideas of power. Jesus clearly came as a servant, not as an overpowering dictator, and those who walk in his ways must do likewise—this is an absolutely explicit teaching in the New Testament (e.g., Luke 22:25–27; Phil.</p>
<p>2:1–11). This is much clearer even than the New Testament teaching on homosexuality. And yet we persist in the use of worldly, un-Christlike power. The fallen desire for power over others profoundly distorts our understanding of Christian faith, and with it the revelation of God received in the incarnation of Jesus.</p>
<p>This has equally terrifying consequences for God’s people.</p>
<p>We see it when an overpowering leader enslaves followers of Jesus. It’s ironic that when this happens, it’s not just the people themselves who are enslaved to the leader, but the leader becomes enslaved to the people. “The tyrant is himself a slave” (Plato). In a situation where power is being abused, the leader will grow only to the height to which the crowd raises him, but he or she ends up in the same state of servitude as the crowd—they are transformed by the very power they exercise.23 This is the very stuff cults are made of, and religious people are susceptible to this abuse of power. Rather than freeing people by helping them relate to Jesus as Lord, control freaks, true to the tendency of the narcissistic personality, actually feed on the needs and adulation of those they lead. And so they become, in M. S</p>
<h2>Ordinate: I nordinate</h2>
<p>We have only mentioned “the big three” (money, sex, and power), but we recognize there is a myriad of smaller, your god is too sick much more subtle ways we can serve or justify our sins and our idolatry. All of this highlights for us the importance of Shema spirituality for the disciple. We are called to love God with mind, heart, soul, and strength. Only by living according to the Shema can the disciple maintain the love relationship with God. And only by living according to the Shema can we maintain what theologians call ordinate love—the idea that loving God first and putting everything else in priority below God enables us to love everything and everyone more than if we love the lesser thing or person exclusively.</p>
<p>The sage advice of C. S. Lewis is that we must actively train ourselves to love God more than the people and things in our world. Remarkably, when we are able to do this the other things in our lives will be enjoyed and loved all the more. However, if we love these at the expense of our love of God, we will eventuallly not love them at all. In fact, as we have seen in “the big three” above, loving anything before God turns it into a tyrannical idol that will consume us in the end. Lewis rightly says that it is probably impossible to love any person or thing too much. But we must, says Lewis, make sure we do not “love these too much in proportion to our love for God.” As he goes on to note, it is always the smallness of our love for God, not the greatness of our love for his creation, that constitutes inordinacy.25 All things find their place in relation to God and God’s scale of values. D</p>
<p>Here we experience again some profound wisdom buried in the heart of Shema spirituality—that loving God as our primary or "first" love (as Rev. 2:4 puts it) actually frees us to experience his world in a far more profound and fulfilling way. "When first things are put first, second things are not suppressed but increased."^26 And again, "aim at Heaven and you will get earth 'thrown in,' aim at earth and you will get neither."^27</p>
<h2>Offering Our World Back to God</h2>
<p>We can see how, in many ways, Shema spirituality goes back to the nature of worship. Not only does the Shema demand that we forgo all forms of idolatry (there is but one God and he demands our total allegiance), it is an all-inclusive claim that extends over all of our lives. To respond to this claim with all we have is what the Bible means by the term “worship.” Worship cannot, and must not, be limited to simply singing songs to God, although it should include that. Worship is nothing less than offering our whole world back to God.</p>
<p>As such, it must involve and include all the elements of life and spirituality, not just religious practices—as if politics, economics, sexuality, and such are somehow excluded from God’s insistence of wholeness before him.28 What is discipleship if not offering our lives back to God?</p>
<p>And what is mission if not offering our world back to God?</p>
<p>In other words, worship, in the broadest and most fundamental understanding of the term, is an adequate category in which to locate an authentic missional spirituality. Such worship is by nature world-engaging and transformative. It can be represented as follows, where all the elements of life are gathered up, unified, and directed toward God in and through Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p>ONE GOD</p>

<p>response unification of life under the One God your god is too sick</p>
<h2>The dangerous act of worship</h2>
<p>Worship is therefore a dangerous act, because to truly encounter the Holy in the act of worship is to change. God requires nothing less than our sanctification: “Be holy because I am holy”(1 Peter 1:16; cf. Lev. 11:44–45). If our encounter with God does not require something of us, we have to ask whether it was really God we encountered.</p>
<p>Rudolf Otto pins down the heart of the worship experience in a somewhat strange combination of Latin words— mysterium tremendum.</p>
<p>The mysterium component is comprised of two elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>God is experienced as the “wholly other”—the encounter is something truly amazing, totally outside our normal experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an element of fascination, which causes the subject of</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the experience of the encounter with the Holy to be caught up in it, enraptured, transformed—drawn into God through his grace</p>
<h2>Tremendum, in turn, is comprised of three elements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>awfulness (inspiring awe, a profound unease)</li>
<li>a sense of being overpowered (that, among other things,</li>
</ul>
<p>inspires a feeling of humility)</p>
<ul>
<li>profound energy (creating an impression of immense</li>
</ul>
<p>vigor) We see exactly this with all the experiences of the biblical saints (for example, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Paul, John, and Peter). All authentic God encounters should contain these two basic dimensions: holy awe (even terror) together with, and at the same time as, divine comfort and grace. While both elements must always be present to some degree, one will tend to predominate. If the untamed god one of these elements is completely missing, then it’s not the biblical God one is encountering. Brennan Manning profoundly captures this awe-grace dimension of the biblical God encounter when he writes (speaking for God), I will not leave you alone. You are mine. I know each of My sheep by name. You belong to Me. If you think I am finished with you, if you think that I am a small god that you can keep at a safe distance, I will pounce upon you like a roaring lion, tear you to pieces, rip you to shreds, and break every bone in your body. Then I will mend you, cradle you in my arms, and kiss you tenderly.29 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the holy God (Hosea 6:1; Heb. 10:31; 12:29).
We love the way Mark Labberton describes worship in his stimulating book The Dangerous Act of Worship: “Worship turns out to be the dangerous act of waking up to God and to the purposes of God in the world, and then living lives that actually show it.”30 It is this last, annoyingly missional component that we so often forget.</p>
<p>First and foremost, worship is a matter of allegiance: whom or what shall we deem worthy of glory, honor, and dominion? To whom shall we ascribe ultimate authority in our lives? Do we offer this to God or the gods? But worship must also lead us to become a particular kind of people, a people who reflect the ways of the God we worship. The important question Lee Camp poses is “Who or what are we truly worshipping?”31 Labberton rightly notes that we have become too selfcentered in our worship. Worship isn’t just about singing songs to God, listening to sermons, partaking in the liturgy, or even simply praying. It must include loving our neighbor, seeking justice for the downtrodden, evangelism, and the renewal of true community.
So JUST DO IT then!</p>
<p>Labberton’s book reminds us that worship is not only about bringing together every aspect of our lives under the lordship of the one God, but also that true knowledge of God is where our heads, hearts, and bodies are put on the line for the sake of the cause of the kingdom. There can be nothing greater in all the world than to love the one true God with all of our heart, mind, soul, and strength, and to love our neighbors as we love ourselves.</p>
<p>If we are going to be missional disciples, we need to put our best efforts into knowing God, into the pursuit of the Holy. This is our first and foremost task. It is also our greatest joy, and to miss this is to miss the whole point of the discipleship.</p>
<p>In choosing God, we gain the world. In a rephrasing of monotheistic Shema spirituality, Jesus commands us to “seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well” (Matt. 6:33). In choosing the kingdom of God, we become the heirs of all things. But we must choose with integrity to live under God. Lewis quotes William Law: “If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God, it will make in the end no difference what you have chosen instead.” He then questions, the untamed god Will it really make no difference whether it was women or patriotism, cocaine or art, whisky or a seat in the Cabinet, money or science?
We shall have missed the end for which we are formed and rejected the only thing that satisfies. Does it matter to a man dying in the desert by which choice of route he missed the only well?33</p>
<h2>Suggested Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regular iconoclasm: Given that we live in a world that</li>
</ul>
<p>demands our attention, and also our loyalties, it is critical that we submit ourselves to a regular inventory of idolatry. This is best done in the context of a loving set of relationships that give us permission to ask the tough questions. Ask questions about how much time is dedicated to certain aspects of your life. What dominates your thinking? What demands your attention?</p>
<p>Relate these to the Shema.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worship beyond singing: The heart of biblical worship</li>
</ul>
<p>is to offer your whole world back to God. Try to love God through the various aspects of your life rather than allowing them to become disassociated from your love of God; that is, see your work, play, and family as part of God’s calling for your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alife of learning: Read the writings of great and broad</li>
</ul>
<p>thinkers in the historical orthodox tradition: it is critical that we find both the depth of thinking and the broad sweep that great thinkers and saints can provide (for example, Augustine, Martin Luther, C. S. Lewis, G. K.</p>
<p>Chesterton, Philip Yancey, etc.). Make space for reflection and thought about the big issues of life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Act your way into a new way of thinking: Our standard</li>
</ul>
<p>approach to learning in Western church circles is usually through the head. But this is not enough to ensure a right your god is too sick knowledge of God. Besides, it was not the way Jesus formed his disciples. He gave instructions and set tasks for the disciples, and then taught them once they had attempted them. Be brave and risk being led by God’s Spirit into new things—things that will challenge you and draw you out of your comfort zones. This means there will be times when you don’t know what you are doing. T</p>
