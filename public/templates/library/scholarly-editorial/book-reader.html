      <h2 class="reader-content__chapter-title">The Crisis of Imagination</h2>

      <p>There is a crisis at the heart of the Western church, and it is not primarily a crisis of attendance, funding, or relevance. It is a crisis of imagination. We have lost the ability to see the church as anything other than what it has become under the long shadow of Christendom -- an institution defined by buildings, professional clergy, and weekly services designed for passive consumption.</p>

      <p>This imaginative failure runs deep. It shapes not only how we structure our communities but how we read Scripture, how we understand leadership, and how we conceive of mission itself. When the inherited model is the only model we can see, every attempt at renewal becomes little more than rearranging the furniture in a house whose foundation is cracking.</p>

      <h2>The Christendom Default</h2>

      <p>For most of its history in the West, the church has operated within what historians call the Christendom paradigm -- a settlement between church and culture that granted Christianity a privileged position in society. Under this arrangement, the church became the chaplain to the empire, providing spiritual services to a population that was Christian by default. Belonging was assumed. Faith was inherited rather than chosen.</p>

      <p>The Christendom paradigm produced extraordinary architecture, rich theological traditions, and institutions of learning that shaped the course of Western civilization. But it also produced a deeply distorted understanding of what it means to be the church. In the Christendom model, the church is primarily an institution that people attend. Its leaders are professionals who manage programs. Its mission is to maintain a religious presence within an already-Christian culture.</p>

      <blockquote>
        The greatest barrier to the future of the church is the memory of what it used to be. We carry in our minds an image of church that was forged in a particular cultural moment, and we have mistaken that cultural expression for the thing itself.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This default setting is so deeply embedded in our collective consciousness that most Christians cannot imagine church any other way. When asked to describe what a healthy church looks like, the overwhelming majority will describe some variation of the Christendom model: a building, a pastor, a Sunday service, a set of programs. The specifics may differ -- contemporary versus traditional, large versus small, urban versus suburban -- but the underlying paradigm remains unchanged.</p>

      <h2>Why Reframing Matters</h2>

      <p>The concept of reframing comes from cognitive psychology and systems thinking. A frame is the mental structure through which we interpret reality. Frames are not reality itself; they are the lenses through which we see reality. They determine what we notice and what we overlook, what we consider possible and what we dismiss as impractical.</p>

      <p>When the frame is wrong, no amount of effort within that frame will produce the right outcome. You can optimize a failing system until it fails more efficiently, but you cannot optimize your way to a fundamentally different result. What is needed is not optimization but reframation -- a wholesale shift in the mental models that govern how we think, plan, and act.</p>

      <p>This is precisely what the New Testament calls <em>metanoia</em>. Though typically translated as "repentance," the word literally means a change of mind -- a fundamental restructuring of how one perceives reality. Jesus began his public ministry with this call: "Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand." He was not primarily calling people to feel sorry for their sins. He was calling them to see the world differently -- to adopt a new frame through which everything, including sin and redemption, would be understood in a radically new way.</p>

      <p>The church today stands in desperate need of this kind of metanoia. We need to repent not only of our personal sins but of our collective failure of imagination. We need to see the church, its mission, and its relationship to the world through the frame that Jesus himself provided -- the frame of the kingdom of God, the frame of apostolic movement, the frame of incarnational mission.</p>

      <p>This book is an attempt to provide that reframe. It is not a program, not a strategy, not a set of techniques for making your existing church more effective. It is an invitation to see differently -- and, having seen differently, to act with courage.</p>
